### Gulf Air customer review
Booked gulf air business class UK to China, £1800 RT (not bad) last minute. About 16-18h each way inclusive of layover. Cabin is very quiet, probably about 20-25% full. Service is ok but nothing to get excited about, I unfortunately got woken up for food service despite do not disturb light on, there’s no lie flat seat cover which makes the lie flat a little bumpy. The amenity kit is fine but nothing to get too thrilled over, they do not have pyjamas any more which was a shame as I was very looking forward to sleeping in clean clothes on the second overnight leg of my long flight. Lounge in Bahrain is good, nice food options although they could do with more comfortable seating. Airplane food was fine but again nothing thrilling or very tasty - I ended up skipping a couple meals just out of lack of interest in the options provided. Meant to be a “dine anytime” service but if you ask for food outside of the service the staff look very irritated. I asked for an extra sandwich during the tea service (I’d slept through breakfast) and was told no by the attendant despite the cabin being very quiet and food definitely being tossed given wouldn’t be finished. Overall value isn’t bad for the price you’re paying as other airlines would be many multiples more, but there certainly could be improvements that'd make it a much more premium experience. Cabin WiFi does not work at all. Recommend if you’re looking for a budget lie flat seat. Beyond the seat, may not be worth it for those who prefer a premium experience (there are better Middle Eastern airlines.)

### “First time and certainly my last”
First time I flew with Gulf Air and it will be my last. The food was not good, even the way they served it was not organized. The toilets were not cleaned even when it was so dirty and the floor was sticky. In flight entertainment was disappointing, not even 20 movies to choose from and the selection were old. Customer service was terrible. Upon receiving my luggage from the carousel, I saw that it was damaged. Two of the wheels were ripped off. I complained and reported to their ground staff and asked for a report but was told to send an email to Bahrain office. Their response was: "Gulf Air assumes no liability for scratches, minor cuts, and dents or items that protrude from baggage, such as wheels, luggage straps, and handles, since during the course of normal baggage handling, your baggage may show evidence of wear and tear". I would never recommend this airline.

### "denied me boarding/checking in"
Don't fly with Gulf Air. They moved my outgoing connecting flight by 12 hours within a weeks notice and didn't even compensate me with anything. Left me and my wife and 5 year old son in the airport in Bahrain without so much as a "we're sorry". They denied me boarding/checking in on the return leg, even though I clearly proved my right of abode and citizenship status to my destination country with not just my current passport, but 3 expired passports for that country. It's beyond a joke then they had the gall to try extort more money from me to change the flight. They offered to change the flights for not just me but my wife and son, when there was no real need for their flights to be changed and then they had the gall to say the best price they could do would be £620 per person.

### "a terrible experience"
I had a terrible experience with Gulf Air and will never fly with them again. The Thailand check-in staff were rude, impatient, and unhelpful, with poor communication and long wait times.

### "these overpriced rebookings"
Not Verified |  The flight and the service on board were quite good and I had nothing to complain about, but then this problem came up. You should have to pay over €800 to rebook your return journey. Many phone calls came to nothing or there was no contact at all. Emails are not responded to and support in Germany is in English. Normally I get by well with my English, but here they didn't want to or couldn't understand me. So everything came to nothing here too. The service from the support team here is terrible. I'm sorry for the service on the plane, but the support outside the plane has to be good too and unfortunately that's not the case here, and from what I've read, I'm not the only one with these overpriced rebookings.

### "Would definitely recommend"
Check-in at Cairo went smoothly. Both flights on time. First sector to Bahrain on a very full A321. Cabin crew did an excellent job. Transit in Bahrain was easy. Second sector to Singapore on a 787 which had plenty of spare seats, allowing passengers to spread out after takeoff. Good meal service and very attentive cabin crew. Would definitely recommend.

### “business class seating looked very old”
Seat 1C A swift flight mainly with Sleep as it was an overnight flight. Airplane was clean although the business class seating looked very old (well worn arm buttons and seat capsule panelling). The Bahrain Gulf Air lounge was a super treat with Dinner options such as Pizza and Lasagne (all were very good!). I certainly look forward to booking my next Gulf Air flight.

### “a comfortable 6 hours sleep was enjoyed”
A very shortened Flight due to favourable Tail Winds saw us arrive 30 minutes early into Bangkok - excellent. My goal was just to sleep on this overnight flight. That goal was achieved and a comfortable 6 hours sleep was enjoyed. The actual Seat was looking shabby & old. No Food or Drink were taken so I can not comment on the service. Would fly Gulf Air again if going to the UK.

### “a good swift flight”
Seat 1C. Overall a very good flight. Seat was comfortable. In flight entertainment had a good selection of Films to watch. Food was good especially the Beef Tenderloin. Champagne was served upon Request. All in all a good swift flight. I would Fly Gulf Air again in the future on the same route.

### “Service was Excellent and Smiling”
Overall a very good flight. However they asked me to complete an Onboard customer survey after Lunch was served (the 1st service). Gulf Air however FAILED to deliver the 2nd service which was Afternoon Tea. As I realized the flight was running out of time I proactively asked the attendant what happened to Afternoon Tea was? She replied "There was a catering mix up and only Asian Food was put onboard for 2nd service" She then asked if I would still like "Afternoon Tea" which I replied YES to! So off she went and bought me "Afternoon Tea" She quietly explained that there was not enough Western Food for all of the 26 Business Class people! Apart from this the Service was Excellent and Smiling happy Female service staff all around. Free Wi-Fi worked fine for the majority of the journey as you would expect. Would still book and pay for Gulf Air anytime in the future.

### "not hesitate to fly Gulf Air again"
We would not hesitate to fly Gulf Air again. Staff interactions were truly professional and courteous. The Bahrain lounge was fantastic. A quiet, peaceful retreat in a superlative modern airport. All staff wore such big smiles and were happy to help.

### "behind the other middle east Airlines"
Return section of my trip from last week, and sadly no improvement I had hoped for. The short flight to Bahrain was okay, the longer one to London was poor, and Gulf Air fall way behind the other middle east Airlines. The meal service was so slow and staff again appeared poorly trained and nervous. There is no sign of hospitality in the service. The same very cramped business class seat in a very worn condition. Again I see another glowing review, and I'm guessing they reviewed a different airline, certainly not Gulf Air. Forget the Falcon lounge at Bahrain and have a coffee in the nice, main terminal area. Overall everything on Gulf Air seems tired and worn out, and the service is lacking. I admit this flight was dirt cheap, but I've learnt my lesson and realise you shouldn't always go for the cheapest option - back to Qatar Airways for me on the next trip.

### “plane left on time”
Our plane left on time and arrived early. The choice of Food and drink onboard is exceptional. Seats are very comfortable, in flight service was amazing. Very happy having flown Gulf Air and enjoyed every minute.

### "not a trace of friendliness"
I must have flown a different airline to the "glowing" recent posts below! Staff at Heathrow were okay, and the lounge in Terminal 4 is quite nice, but that is where it ends. On the Boeing 787, my business class seat was very worn, loose fittings and in need of replacement. The cabin crew seemed to have little clue what they were doing with slow, clumsy and inattentive service, and not a trace of friendliness or wanting to be there. The meal was okay, somewhat canteen style and not a patch on the fine dining of Qatar Airways I used last time. A shortish transit in Bahrain, and the Golden Falcon lounge is not somewhere you want to dwell. The toilets were dirty and also things falling apart, and it all has an air that it is not maintained at all. I do agree that the main Bahrain terminal is very nice, compact and user friendly - you are better off staying there and not wasting time on a sub-standard lounge. Short flight to Jeddah was okay, a fair meal and quick if unfriendly service.

### “A Faultless Experience”
A faultless & professional end to end Experience from Gulf Air. All staff interactions along the way were professional and courteous. Check In at Bangkok was painless. The upgraded Bangkok Miracle lounge was an unexpected surprise! The Bahrain Gulf Air lounge was just fantastic. A quiet, peaceful retreat in a superlative modern airport. We would not hesitate to fly Gulf Air again.

### "Seats are very comfortable"
Our plane left on time and arrived early. The choice of Food and drink offered onboard is exceptional. Seats are very comfortable, in flight service was amazing. Very happy having flown Gulf Air and enojyed every minute of the experience. We look forward to booking, paying and flying on Gulf Air again in the near future.

### “it is very worth it for the paid price”
It is seen, that this airline saving its budget, in comparison with Qatar Airways and Emirates (creamer powders instead of an ordinary milk, no refreshing wipes, apron bus used for boarding in Frankfurt...), but it is very worth it for the paid price, because it was one of the cheapest options available, even in comparison with Turkish Airlines, Azerbaijan Airlines, Pegasus Airlines and Air Serbia, which are the most frequently used on such routes. The airport in Bahrain is the separate story: comfortable and few people!

### “they don’t even respond to you”
In less than 24 hours I was notified that the airplane is delayed by 3 hours, and my next airplane from Bahrain to Abu Dhabi is shifted by 15 hours in Bahrain, when I went to Bangkok airport I discovered that the plane is delayed by 10.30 hours and my next one 15 hours, I missed next day's work because of this terrible experience, not recommended at all, their ground staff are very rude, no wonder this airline is sinking nowadays, never ever again. I tried to get a compensation as my job deducted one day from myself and my wife, they don’t even respond to you, so no wonder calling it the worst airline ever.

### "was a worst experience"
Not Verified |  First of all the boarding experience was not good. The persons sitting at the counters are not clear of the rules of baggage allowance. As we experience that they treat every person differently for e.g some are allowed to carry two bags in cabins whereas some are asked to pay for carrying a laptop bag in the cabin. When we ask about the same they argue and ask as not to question anything. Thus this was a worst experience and will never ever fly with Gulf air in future and will also not recommend to anyone.

### "denied boarding twice"
Horrible experience of traveling with this airline! Flights in both directions were oversold, at check-in I was denied boarding twice, despite having purchased tickets and because of them I did not have time to board the flight and was late for the connecting flight. I wrote a complaint, in response they offered a lousy coupon for a flight with their company, which is not valid in my country. Never fly with this airline, they will definitely deceive you!

### "GF refuse to reimburse"
Not Verified |   Missed connection in BAH due to 3hr + delay in flight out of MCT. Despite being told to keep receipts for out of pocket expenses for 24 hr enforced stopover and our expenses for a family of 3 being ca €80 only, GF refuse to reimburse and offer time limited air miles only which are of no use or value to us living in Germany. Flight compensation also offered only as air miles. Airline is a fraction of its former self. Onboard comfort is minimal, food quality and service are pushing limits of acceptability.

### "upgraded to business class for free"
I was upgraded to business class for free which shows how serious Gulf Air is with the comfort of their Silver/Gold Falconflyers. The service was outstanding while the food was ok but no complaints. My only drawback is that Gulf Air should consider charging more competitive prices to be able to compete with other regional airlines.

### "denied us with my 2 children"
First they overbooked the flight and denied us with my 2 children (3 and 5 yrs old) then they transferred us to flyDubai flight for next day and flyDubai did not accept us at their check in counter due to non-payment issue from Gulf Air. I went to reservation office of gulf air at Bahrain Airport they did not even offer a water for us despite us having a terrible experience for a flight that we paid and still not able to depart from the airport to our destination. They reissued another ticket with flyDubai for us and said everything is going to be ok this time. We’re off to airport one more time in a few hours to see what will happen this time.

### “my first and last experience of them”
This is the first and last time I will fly with this airline, they were appalling. The flight out was delayed so I missed my connection. The flight back was delayed on my return flight. The air crew were rude (they need to be trained in customer service) they were rude to passenger's and talking about them whilst other passengers were still on board. The decided to serve breakfast on the return flight when it was 47 mins to destination! Who does that, then whilst people were eating they were taking their trays and food away mid meal.. what sort of airline is this? The crew need to remember that is the passengers flight tickets that pay their salaries and those flight tickets also include their meals. I will never fly Gulf Air again. This was my first and last experience of them.

### "they were planning to offload us"
At the time of check-in, the counter staff informed that they would upgrade the ticket and asked us to wait for 30 minutes. We waited for almost 30 mins while I understood that they had not even checked-in the pax. Without even check-in, how can they upgrade a pax? We had a doubt and enquired in another counter and came to understand that they were planning to offload us. The reason for off load was that the "flight was overbooked". Our ticket was purchased 3 months back and we received email confirmation the same day morning as well. They don't seem to understand the value of time and the stress we go through at that juncture. We had to raise our voice to make them understand our situation. Gulf Air is offering such unprofessional service. We are paying for their service and they are not doing any favour. So all those who opt for GF, please make sure you do online chek-in and baggage as early as possible (24 hours -check-in) otherwise they will come up with drama where the ending would be a tragedy for each of us.

### "Really an awful experience"
Flight was delayed twice because of which me and my family missed our onward bus journey to Bhopal and was stranded at the airport up until next scheduled bus the next morning as we had no where to go. Check-in staff didn't inform about the flight delay - should they inform earlier we would reschedule our flight again. Inflight entertainment was not working for me and family [4 seats] and no alternative seats were provided, food was served cold. As per Gf customer service - short delays are okay. Because of the initial delay we had to reissue the tickets and reschedule our plan and yet with the rescheduled flight dates we faced delay again and missed our bus journey and ended up being stranded in Mumbai up until next day as we couldn't afford the hotels near the airport and because of that we ended up being 2 days behind our schedule. Really an awful experience - would never choose GF again

### "not hesitate to recommend Gulf Air"
Not Verified |   I was apprehensive about this flight but the price was irresistible. In the final analysis I had no problems. Online check in worked perfectly, Boarding was on time but more consideration needs to be given to Biz pax in Bahrain. The level of comfort and leg room on the Boeing 787  was wonderful. Service was excellent and food was appetizing. Flights left and arrived on time. I had lengthy stopovers each way in Bahrain but the lounge was fabulous. I would not hesitate to recommend Gulf Air.

### "baggage never found"
Flight booked on business class Bangkok to Tel Aviv via Bahrain with gulf air early 2023. One baggage never came. Filled in report at TLV airport, baggage never found. Been in contact with gulf air as they asked to go to their office to file some forms (no where to upload online). As I am not residing in Bahrain or in a country where they have actual office I have asked for solution and been ignored since. Contact their specific team that handle luggage claims and they ignore my last 5 emails. In Dubai went to their office and they said they do not handle this cases here.

### "will never fly on Gulf Air again"
I’m sorry to give bad review but unfortunately I do not any choice, Gulf Air  have forced me to give them bad review. Gulf Air misplaced our luggage and all our valuable stuff. Its been almost 6weeks now we don't have any response from them - no compensation been given to us and no one even bother contacting us and informing us where is our baggage. Really really disappointed. We booked business class seats, the treatment was good but this this put me off. I will never fly on Gulf Air again and will never recommend to anyone

### "asked us to come after 3 days"
I am 73 years old, I was planning to travel from Casablanca to Bahrain on March 11, 24, when I arrived at Gulf Air check-in desk, I was shocked to learn that I and some other passengers had been refused boarding because the flight was overbooked, and without any logic, the person in charge asked us to come after 3 days. Yes, after 3 days (not 3 hours) And because of carelessness. He didn't bother to put a message on my reservation stating that I was returned from the airport Or until my reservation on the ticket changes for the new day (to after 3 days).

### “the service borders on shocking”
Gulf Air could be elevated from pretty ok to very good if only the cabin service improved. I have flown Gulf on and off for 40 years, always on time in my case. The planes are newish, the A321 neo has flat beds, decent tv screen etc but  the service borders on shocking. Had to ask for a drinks menu which is a small piece of paper with small range of drinks, not proactive offering them mainly due to maybe cultural sensitivities, the lunch menu was the crews single bit of paper crossing out choices as they went through. Pre take off is good, dates, coffee and best hot towel of any airline. Thereafter its downhill, food is ok nothing special, no wines offered, no coffee, no digestifs. Come on Gulf, with a bit of care and flair you could be brilliant.

### “later I get full compensation”
After late inbound auf der connecting aircraft in Bahrain and a technical issue that had to be fixed I arrived late on my final destination. Airline took very good care of the passengers and a couple of weeks later I get full compensation 600 euros under European law. I am looking forward to my next flight with Gulf Air.

### "Gulf Air is the worst airline"
Not Verified |  Gulf Air is the worst airline. The plane had an engine down and they insisted to keep us inside it for more than two hours. Then they told us that due to visibility and weather conditions the flight will be delayed until 6.30, though we were supposed to reach our destination at 2.10.

### "do not recommend Gulf Air"
Not Verified |  One of the worst experiences with an international airline. The ground staff at Bahrain airport were arrogant. One of the worst delays and deboarding experiences of my life. I personally do not recommend Gulf Air to my dear ones.

### "demotivated and disinterested2
The whole left and side of the economy seat inflight entertainment screen was frozen and not working and the crew have ignored seeing the same. And they still had the audacity to play the safety video on right hand side only instead of performing a manual demo. So whole flight to Mumbai 3 hours there was no tv. Crew was terribly demotivated and disinterested. I even found one crew next to my seat sleeping through out landing.

### “Gulf Air is the worst”
I travel almost twice a year, on this year and have travelled with many airlines, by far Gulf Air is the worst. Neither does the cabin crew nor the Ground staff pay heed to customers needs, requests or complaints. Mine was round trip from LHR to DEL and DEL to LHR. Both the times I did not get the vegetarian food in spite of filling the special request at the time of check in. On my first trip I was not aware that my need will not be fulfilled so I didn't take the picture but second time, I captured a screenshot as a proof. On both the trips I requested the ground staff as well as cabin crew but they said we have not received the request. The cabin staff on my first trip still better, at least they patiently listened to me but second trip, they didn't even pay heed.

### "Worst experience ever"
They lost my luggage and don't reply to me. Worst experience ever. I flew in business class and in the arrival I didn't find my luggage. Well, they lost it. The worst part? If you call them they close the call. I basically lost a baggage with 2000$ of clothes inside and they just don't care. Worst experience ever. How is possible in 2023 to run a company like that?

### "given a front extra leg room seat"
Was given a front extra leg room seat which was super comfortable. The cabin crew and ground service for Gulf Air keep getting better. The snack was delicious.

### "Gulf wants to be a low budget"
Not Verified |  Wanted to arrive in Manila early morning. Gulf would get me there 10.20. Had flown this airline once before (pre covid) so was aware of 9 hour transit in Bahrain on return leg. Previously London bound passengers were taken to nice hotel, given room, breakfast and transport back to airport. Not this time. Nne of the 4 flights had newspapers or an inflight magazine. No alcohol on trolleys, (I was in Economy). Seated at the very back (my request), I did hear one or two ahead of me requesting an alcoholic drink, did not hear the stewards reply, but it was in the negative. On return, at Bahrain, no one to meet us to take us to hotel, no information whatever. Finally found Gulf Air help desk (opposite Gate 18), lady there informed me they no longer gave free hotel, but gave me a food voucher which I could use in one of the fast food outlets, I chose KFC. Fortified by my meal I found a nice bar (like a sports bar with football on TV). Later on decided to pay walk in fee for Gulf lounge (70 $ US for 4 hours), but at least I had some decent food and a few vodka and tonics to help me sleep on the final leg to London. My impression, Gulf wants to be a low budget, no frills airline, but has forgotten to reduce its price accordingly. I was frequent flier pre covid and used Emirates, Qatar, Etihad, and other airlines in the past. Will be using these others for future flights.

### "missed my connection flight"
My first flight Tbilisi to Bahrain was delayed as result I missed my connection flight from Bahrain to Manila. I had other connection flight from Manila to Bacolod (by AirAsia) and this ticket burned. Company shifted my flight on 24 hours, so I ve decided to buy a new ticket Manila-Bacolod. When I arrived at airport on next day, I can see that my flight Manama - Manila delayed on 3 hours. As result my second ticket Manila - Bacolod burned. All in all, I ve bought 4 tickets Manila Bacolod (for me and my wife) and I ve reached Manila 27 hours later. My vacation was ruined. I spent additional 500$ on lost 2 vacations days. Wifi and TV doesn't work.

### “horrible customer service”
Terrible airline, really bad quality food and above all horrible customer service. When I wanted to change my ticket they quoted me a charge that would be higher than if I just booked a whole new ticket with the same flight, same airline, same seat. Then when I tried to request a refund, they claimed that I would not be able to get a refund as apparently the cancellation charge would exceed the return ticket. Sneaky and pathetic ways of trying to make money which will result in a loss of a potential lifetime customer since I actually am from Bahrain (Gulf Air HQ). I will do my best to avoid ever using them again and the same for all my family and friends.

### "makes you pay for their mistakes"
Not Verified |  Great airline until you have the smallest problem - and then you are left totally alone. Nice service, good planes. But once there is the smallest problem - you are left alone, they will not help you with anything, just add difficulties. Our flight from Bahrain to Manila was delayed 2 times : 2 hours delay that they announced a day before the flight and 2.5 hours more at the airport. Total of 4.5 hours delay. That caused passengers to miss their domestic flight from Manila and I had to buy a new flight. The ground staff of Gulf Air in Bahrain Airport told me to write a complaint to Gulf Air customer service about it and ask for a refund. Until now, 3 weeks later, no reply from them. This is only the start. On the flight back - they canceled the flight from Manama to Tel Aviv due to political instability reasons. They didn't give an alternative destination option, they didn't give an alternative date, they didn't give anything- just an option to refund, without even mentioning the amount. Although they sent a mail for canceling only Manama- Tel Aviv section only, and keeping Manila-Bahrain flight as is, when I came to check in, they took long time to deal with my reservation, told me that my reservation was canceled, and asked me to call their ticketing office to rebook my flight. Yes, they are working in Gulf Air and they are asking me to make a new reservation. Amazing, they said that my reservation was canceled (they didn't send any email about it) and they asked for additional fee to rebook it! So not only they did few mistakes, not only they gave 3 flights instead of 4, they also asked additional money for it. Gulf air makes you pay for their mistakes.

### "unexpected bad experiences"
My boarding date was 29.09.2023 from Colombo Airport. The airport counter staff who represent Gulf Air behaved with me very rudely and gave me unexpected bad experiences. As the result of the way he handled me, I was the last passenger to entered into the flight. I submitted every document properly and clearly, even though he wasted more than an hour of my precious time. I never recommend you to select this kind of service.

### "Very poor experience"
Very poor experience of a long haul flight. Just atrocious. First with the seats. My boarding pass placed me in the aisle of the three seat group. One of the attendants approached me and asked me whether I could help them out and change seats as some people are trying to sit together or whatever. They said the other seat would have more legroom. So I accepted without a problem. I grabbed my bag and walked over to the new seat and had to wait for a bit until I could sit down. More legroom as promised. So far so good. Another person had also taken the deal and was seated next to me. Then another attendant comes over, looks at me and just starts talking about me to the other attendant. What is this person doing here? He shouldn't be here. That's not his seat. Get him away from here' while pointing their finger at me. So I get told to vacate the seat (not the other person though who had moved there) and get told to just go back to my seat. As I find my old seat it's been taken by someone and so have all the other seats. I'm left there standing with my bag. I have to ask an attendant where I can sit but they're out of the loop, asking me well what does your boarding pass say? This goes on, and anyway, I'm the last person without the seat, so one seat is indeed remaining, some middle seat. I've been downgraded in the end. Plane is really hot. Not even water gets brought out for two hours into the flight. I luckily had some water with me, else I would have been on the verge of passing out. I was so uncomfortable the entire flight. Water just wasn't being brought out. Attendants weren't even walking around to offer any other drinks. I had to put my call light on to ask for water else I wouldn't get any. This was an issue on every one of the four flights I took with them. Once the trolley did go round as seldom as that was, I had to ask for two cups of drink at a time because I was so dehydrated and it just felt like you're in the wrong for even asking them. Didn't feel welcome or accommodated. A typical long haul flight would mean I get to grab a beer and chill out. With Gulf Air I struggled to even get a cup of water. I hated every moment of being on this plane. I never want to be nice and help out someone for their seats again.

### "cabin crew efficient and friendly"
Not Verified |  Very Impressive, the flights were very comfortable and the aircraft clean and smart. Bahrain a pleasure to transit through. The onboard catering was very good on all flights and the cabin crew efficient and friendly.

### "Unpleasant experience"
Unpleasant experience, we had purchased front seat tickets and those seats were printed on the ticket as a confirmation, each name with the seat number, once we checked in they gave us back seats ignoring the purchased seats, spent 45min requesting the airport Gulf Air support office to give us the seats purchased by us but the answer was “sorry the seats are taken by others”. How come taken by others if I did pay for them. In the end we lost the seats and my family had to sit in the back seats. Tried to complain later after the flight via call centre, online chat and emails, amazingly no reply.

### "Thank you Gulf Air"
Not Verified |  I was stuck in the airport with my visa processing problem. I needed to get to the Dubai on September 5 but unfortunately my visa wasn't processed so I missed the flight. I got my visa process done so I went to the counter of Gulf Air, where I found a gentleman, I didn't get the name, but he told me to wait for 1 hour, after that I went back to him where he gave me a new ticket and the surprising part was that he also gave me a food voucher. Great experience, will never forget this. Thank you Gulf Air.

### "vegetarian lunch was a flop"
Check in staff in Mumbai Airport were very friendly. The crew onboard were also friendly and professional but the vegetarian lunch onboard was a flop. It was mutter (peas) but they were stale and/or old hence inedible.

### "no inflight entertainment"
I travelled with my three kids. There was no inflight entertainment. No activity packs were given to kids aged under 12. The screens were kept turned off neither were any head sets provided. The crew never showed up even after pressing the call button.

### "really professional and attentive"
Not Verified |  I have now flown this route twice with Gulf Air. As a business class traveller this is one of the best experiences. The check-in at Jeddah was very efficient and fast, even the economy class line was rapid and with several desks. The shorter leg to Bahrain was extremely well managed, the flight was about half full but the attendants were really professional and attentive. The entertainment good and Wi-Fi also seemed to work well for those using it. The food was fine, a Caesar salad with desert and drinks. On arrival at Bahrain the transit was really easy, well signposted and negotiating the security checks also easy; they have the advanced scanners so you do not have to remove all your electronics from your carry-on baggage, great plus and much quicker. The Falcon lounge at Bahrain is large, well equipped, with a good selection of foods, a bar, internet, showers, some game consoles for children, comfortable and well spaced out seating; a very pleasant experience. The longer flight Bahrain - Paris was equally good, more passengers but the staff were equally attentive, 2 meals (if wanted) were served, in flight drinks of a good standard and, again, a pleasant experience. The unloading at Paris was again good and the only bad point was the Paris CDG fiasco, long queues to get through immigration (fast track was a real bonus!) then about a 40 minute wait for the baggage. I cannot thank Gulf Air enough and will continue to use them for this route.

### "cabin crew service was absolutely terrible"
The cabin crew service was absolutely terrible on the connection from Bahrain to Thiruvananthapuram. They did not attend to cabin assistance calls. They don’t distribute any headsets and says excuse that it’s not available or they are going to upgrade the entertainment system. I had to wait for them to bring meals so that I can mention my request for headset. They ignored my multiple assistance calls over an hour, not to mention the call requests from many others. They didn’t distribute blankets. They were distributing meals on their own preferences and only offered choice to a rare few of their choice. This was when they had multiple Meal options in flight for vegetarian and non vegetarian passengers. I will avoid this airline at all costs and wouldn’t recommend them to anyone ever.

### "I was upgraded to Business Class free"
The ground staff were polite and attentive. I was upgraded to Business Class free of charge which my trip kick off on a very high note. I can’t thank you enough for this. The flight service was really good. Very fast and reliable wifi. The food was some the best I’d had on an airplane. Very comfortable flight and a cool infotainment system.

### "a huge improvement in services"
It’s my 2nd time with Gulf air in the last 6 years and I should say that there is a huge improvement in services. The journey was so smooth starting from the first point, the crew and the ground staff were all attentive. But what I like most is the free hotel during the long layover, it was really amazing. They pick me up from the airport and give me a room in 5 star hotel for the 12 hrs layover. It was refreshing. I will definitely fly back with Gulf Air in my next journey and recommend everyone.

### "this low price comes with drawbacks"
Gulf Air is seen as a cost-effective airline option in the Middle East, but this low price comes with drawbacks. One issue is the lack of a separate lane for business class passengers at check-in in Paris, which can create disorganization and is not appealing for those seeking a seamless experience. The ground staff has also been criticized for being unprofessional and confused at times, highlighting the need for better training. Furthermore, Gulf Air does not have its own lounge facilities and instead relies on Air France's lounge in Paris, raising concerns about exclusivity. Champagne served on board was warm, showing a lack of attention to detail. Gulf Air's affordability is a selling point for budget-conscious travelers, but there are compromises. The lack of a separate business class lane, unqualified ground staff, reliance on external lounges, inattentive service, and warm champagne all exemplify the compromises passengers may have to accept for a lower fare. Those who value a high-quality travel experience may be left wanting more.

### "refused to give bassinet"
My wife with one infant + 5 years old child travelled in Gulf Air on 8th July from MAN to MAA. We booked bassinet for our 9 month old baby with a paid seat for my son next to bassinet. After boarding to the flight, air hostess refused to give bassinet. Overall worst experience ever in the flight for family.

### "hours of extreme trouble"
I booked a flight from Bahrain to Faisalabad about a month ago. I reached the airport on the day of flight. To my shock, they informed me and about 50 other passengers that the aircraft was already full. They made us wait for hours without any explanation. If someone shouted at their unprofessional behaviour, they shouted back. Later, the staff offered two difficult options; either to go to Islamabad instead of Faisalabad with the next flight or to wait for another few hours to get a new ticket for a flight to Faisalabad two days later. I had already spent hours at the airport in this frustration, I chose to go to Islamabad. It took me hours of extreme trouble to reach from Islamabad to Faisalabad all because of this nonsense done by Gulf Air. They are extremely arrogant people, very unprofessional, rude to the passengers, and untrustworthy. They offer no explanation, no compensation for changing the tickets and no sympathy to the poor passengers who made the mistake of booking with them.

### "only one person is working"
Not Verified |  Writing this as I'm still experiencing the problems of Gulf Air. The online check-in doesn't work and I was told I cannot do it by phone. There is no self check in kiosk here at their counters and I am not checking any bags. Also only one person is working forcing a huge line and they chose the one place in the airport without AC to put their counters. Also, it's the day of the flight and they're still trying to get full price to upgrade to business. Which is whatever but just thought I'd mention it. So far this airline is at the bottom of the list all the way around. I don't know where the money from ticket sales even goes here.

### "business class is a must-try"
For those who frequently traverse the skies and appreciate excellent in-flight service and comfort, Gulf Air's business class is a must-try. They stand out with their staff's dedication and warm hospitality, paired with top-tier in-flight dining. However, the standout feature has to be the spaciousness offered - it's unrivalled by other airlines in the same class. The lounge is an entertainment hub, boasting a golf simulator, immersive 4D games, and even pool tables, as well as an outdoor smoking area. Choosing the Hublot site place if possible would be my tip - it offers an unparalleled level of privacy that mimics a personal room. They even provide sleepwear, so you don't need to sleep in your regular clothes. All these thoughtfully curated details elevate Gulf Air's service to a league of its own. Don't pass up the opportunity to experience this if you have the chance.

### Gulf Air customer review
I booked a short flight to go to Frankfurt via Bahrain. Big mistake. My flight was forwarded by 6 hours without an option. This doubled my flight time. So I had to hang out for 6 hours in a small airport. The staff at DMM airport was not too friendly. I do not recommend this airline.

### "grossly incompetent"
While booking they claimed I could earn miles on American Airlines. When I went to airport, on my boarding pass they gave me a boarding pass which clearly indicated that they used my American Frequent Flier number. But when I did not see miles on my American account, I contacted American who informed me that Gulf is not their partner. I contacted Gulf many times regarding this and they never replied. Either they are grossly incompetent or complete frauds.

### "We will fly with them again"
Not Verified |  This was the first time we had flown with Gulf Air, what a pleasant surprise. At the airport great staff, really helpful. The plane clean and seat comfy for economy. Food good for economy, staff helpful, entertainment system good but choice of newer films very limited. We will fly with them again.

### "A321 Neo was amazing and neat"
With regards to terminal experience, I hope they put out a queue for those who have done online check-in in Abu Dhabi airport. I also like to express my appreciation to the airline for it's cabin crew for doing their jobs well in my recent very short flight of 1 hour. I know they had a bit of a hectic schedule since they also provided snacks during the flight given that it takes a while to serve and clean up in between take off and descent/landing. Aside from that, the A321 Neo aircraft was amazing and neat.

### "online checkin didn’t work"
Not Verified |  On the outbound trip I wasn’t able to choose a seat when checking in online. On the return flight the online checkin didn’t work, it said I had to checkin at the airport. At the airport I asked for an exit seat and the checkin lady in Muscat confirmed that I was at an emergency exit. When I entered the airplane I realised I was not seated at an emergency exit, but the row behind it. I asked the cabin crew how this could happen and they just said the checkin lady probably made a mistake.

### "Onboard the experience is ok"
I was yelled at by several ground crew between entering the airport and boarding the plane, for issues that were caused by the airline. Onboard the experience is ok, but I can only imagine how bad it would be if you had a significant issue that required Customer Service on the ground.

### "not at all bothered about customers"
Business Class from Kuwait to Chennai via Bahrain. Kuwait-Bahrain of short duration and not much to experience, though it provided options for flat bed. Bahrain - Chennai Flight. A320 Neo air has Bucket Seat in Business Class. Food I had ordered for AVML but it started with an unimpressive salad with some other odd item. I asked for some Fruits in lieu of the food, for which i was given a small cup with 4 slices of some fruits. Customer Service Pathetic would be the right word as the crew was not at all bothered about the customers at all. They never asked me if i need something else and when i asked for cookies, they didn't have any. One small bottle of water was all that was provided during the entire journey. While i was attempting to sleep, the cabin-crew was busy chatting.

### "cabin of the 787 was nice and comfortable"
Not Verified |  Ground staff particularly helpful and eager to assist. The cabin of the 787 was nice and comfortable. However, the picture quality of the IFE needs to be improved. The meal was alright, pretty standard.

### "Exceptional experience"
Exceptional experience throughout my journey from London to Lahore via Bahrain on 27 Jan, 2023. The services, I have received from Gulf Air were incredible and I was treated so restful. At the check-in, the staff member was so decent, polite, kind, warm welcomed and professional. He served me with highly respectful mannered. On board, I have got great customer/passenger services from your staff members and crew. They all were so talented, nice, kind and had great customer care skills. Thank you Gulf Air and Team to make my journey so special and memorable.

### "horrible experience not resolved"
In the second leg of my flight from BAH to CDG, as there was no cabin space my 3 cabin bags were collected by staff in the flight and told us that they will keep it in cargo and give us back in CDG airport before we get down from the flight. As they have confirmed that they are not checking the bags in and keeping it in CARGO, they haven't given us any receipt or bag tags. When enquired with flight Attendant in CDG, she insisted that the bags will reach our final destination, i.e. DFW in this instance (even though bag tags are not available). But the bags haven't reached our final destination. Its been more than 6 days since my date of travel (15th Jan, 2023), but my bags haven't reached me. The baggage department is also very unresponsive even though i have given my bags description to them. I feel that the staff who has collected our bags in BAH should have informed the flight attendant that these are the bags to be handed over in CDG. With this horrible experience not resolved, i would rather pay more for a ticket than journey through Gulf Air again.

### "could not check in on website"
2 tickets and both time I could not check in on website or with the app. Customer service is horrible: chat did not understand question. Ending up too early in airport from Bahrain to Jeddah took from 10.00 - 16.00 since the flight was delayed with 45 mins. I got a seat at rear end of plane as a result of not checking in on eariest possible moment. No problem if something goes wrong one time, but with 2 tickets it is simply unacceptable.

### "I totally recommend this airline"
I would say Gulf air service is excellent. In a return flight I got late for the flight. I almost missed the flight and the boarding gate was already closed but Gulf air service agents were rigorously calling me and found me in the airport. They helped me to wave long ques and convinced other people saying emergency boarding. Regardless of this experience, both meal options veg and non-veg were good. The customer care support was also good. Sometimes the air hostesses appear rude but overall its fine. I totally recommend this airline.

### "Bahrain to Cochin was one of the worst"
Not Verified |  Worst service ever. I had my kid who is one year old. Even after pressing buzzer airhostess on that day didn’t care to give a glass of water. She just switched off the buzzer and left us. I had a great experience travelling from London to Bahrain, the staff were very considerate. But Bahrain to Cochin was one of the worst.

### "o not respond to customer complaints"
Not Verified |  They do not respond to customer complaints and requests. I went through a number of issues on my flights back from Bangkok, for which I sought compensation from Gulf Air and been ignored. It is impossible to get a response from them and the phone numbers on their website do not work. My initial itinerary was supposed to take 10.5 hours, which was changed to a new itinerary which would've taken over 14. On the day, the first flight was delayed, causing me to miss my connecting flight to Riyadh (also with Gulf Air), meaning i had to spend the night in a hotel and fly the next day. Overall, my final journey took over 21 hours, and I arrived at my final destination more than 26 hours later than i had originally planned, given the initial flight change.

### "Such horrible attitude"
For the entire flight (GF 270), the front half of the flight was extremely hot. Through the AC vents hot air was blowing. When we told this to the flight attendant, he refused to accept that there was any temperature change. People were fanning themselves with paper and the instruction pamphlet. When I brought this to his notice, he said that "they are all people with high blood pressure". Such horrible attitude while people were feeling suffocated in that heat!

### "I would recommend Gulf Air"
Gulf Air operates the narrow body A321 Neo to Rome and Milan. From Milan to Rome, a light snack was being served. More passengers boarded in Rome for the flight to Bahrain. Pre-departure Arabic coffee and date was offered. After take off, it was lunch service. Although the flight was operated by a narrow body aircraft, there were 4 main course selections. I had the veal ossobucco, a Milanese dish which was tasty and tender. Dessert came around on a trolley - there was a choice of cakes, fruits and cheese. The flight attendant who served me on this flight was a nice Korean lady who was attentive and polite. As with middle eastern airlines, the inflight entertainment weighed heavily on Arabic movies and music. The selection of Hollywood movies was limited. Overall, I would recommend Gulf Air for flights between Asia and Europe. Connectivity in Bahrain is good and the Falcon Fold Lounge is well stocked with food.

### "Avoid this airline if you can"
On October 13 I take my flight from Paris to Bahrain then Bahrain Bangkok. The Paris Bahrain flight is going very well. Arrived in Bahrain the flight Bahrain Bangkok is delayed the next day at 8.40 am which is 10 hours late and we face a refusal of care . The manager on the ground tells us all the flights of the other airlines are full and they have no hotel rooms available. After 2 hours distribution of good meals, I take mine. An agent from Bahrain airport company calls out to me saying that it is not right to do this. I eat at kfc with my voucher. I take this opportunity to give my boarding pass with his group and we get accommodation at golden tulip. Once out we wait 50 minutes for the driver to take us to the hotel and a staff from Gulf air staff arrives - the minivan can accommodate 15 people but she tried to park 30 of us in it and it made her laugh. Arrived at the 3 star hotel we were treated like cattle. The only sentence I heard when I arrived at the hotel is wait in line. At the hotel counter my passport and my boarding pass are kept and the person from the hotel tells me here is your room number it's this way and we slept barely 3 hours. The next morning I notice that the buffet for passengers of the gulf air flight is downstairs and that the rest of the hotel has its buffet upstairs. At 7 am we leave the hotel for the airport. We get on the plane I tell all this to the purser who has absolutely nothing to do with it. Avoid this airline if you can.

### "I will not be flying Gulf Air again"
I was travelling from Istanbul to Bangkok with my husband after attending our wedding. When we arrived at the airport we were told that the flight had been overbooked and we were being downgraded to economy. Since the staff were aware we were travelling for a special occasion they kindly bought us a cake on the first flight IST-BAH (thanks to the airport manager at IST for kindly arranging this). The second flight from IST-BKK, stopped over in Singapore but the staff at check-in and the crew on the plane didn't really have any clue about the arrangements for this - as if they had no idea it was happening. Upon arriving in BKK (our final destination), our luggage did not arrive. It contained many items close to our hearts ... wedding gifts, cards written by family and friends, photos and memories that cannot be replaced. Gulf air customer service is a nightmare and they seem totally unwilling to help - I am trying to trace the baggage myself by calling the various airlines and talking to the ground services directly. I will not be flying Gulf Air again. Service is okay in Business class but could definitely be better, same goes with the lounge in BAH. Inflight entertainment is a joke - you have a choice of about 3 films.

### "we were able to change seats"
I appreciate that the boarding was organized based on zones which made it very smooth and ensured everyone had enough space in the overhead compartments. It was not a full flight so we were able to change seats and get more comfortable spots. The first supper meal was just sandwiches which I skipped and the breakfast was pretty good with an omelette and sausage. The airline needs to work on the infotainment. The highlight is the reasonably priced Falcon WiFi which was very efficient and helped me stay in touch with my friends and family back home.

### "seats are comfortable for economy"
The flight was delayed for an hour and when we entered the aircraft it was really really hot. The seats are comfortable for economy class. When dinner was served, the flight attendant on the left aisle told me they ran out of the chicken option. The vegetarian pasta was delicious though. The wifi was awesome while the infotainment was lacking in my opinion compared to other airlines. The adapter sockets were not working and when I asked if they could check the main power source, I was told to change my seat if I wanted to charge my phone.

### "cabin crew attentive and friendly"
I flew Gulf Air Singapore to Milan via Bahrain on 28 October 2022. The first leg of the journey was operated by a B787 featuring the Apex Suites. The Suites were comfortable and had good privacy even though arranged in a 2-2-2 configuration. Each seat has direct aisle access. There were 2 meals on this sector - dinner and light meal. There were some service lapses on this sector. Dinner service did not commence until almost 2 hours after departure and given the late departure from Singapore after a one hour delay, it was almost midnight when dinner was served. The amenity kit was given out only just before landing in Bahrain - it should have been given out at the start of the flight - blankets were not distributed at the start of the flight. The flight attendant placed a blanket over me while I was sleeping. I am not finding fault with the crew. They did their very best given the shortened turnaround time in Singapore to make up for the late inbound flight. The second sector to Milan with a brief stop in Rome was operated by a narrow body A321 Neo. Again two meals were served - supper and breakfast. I had the mezze for supper and omelette and sausage for breakfast. Both were delicious. Amenity kit, blanket, slippers and pyjamas were distributed on this 6 hour flight to Rome. A small snack was served for the short hop from Rome to Milan. Overall I found the cabin crew to be attentive and friendly despite the service lapses in the first sector. The hard product was comfortable and Gulf Air is one of the few airlines that distribute pyjamas on medium haul flights. Inflight entertainment was adequate but not fantastic with emphasis on Arabic movies and music.

### "overall a very pleasant flight"
It was a midnight flight and to my surprise, the aircraft was full as 80% of the passengers were transiting via Bahrain. New and comfortable aircraft, great infotainment system and spacious economy seats although the A/C was centralized so we could not control it which made the cabin a little warm. Take-off was a little delayed which is not usual for Gulf Air, but overall a very pleasant flight.

### "Cabin Crew were attentive"
Pleasant flight although it was an older aircraft and the trip was a little bit bumpy. Take-off was on time with no issues at all. Food was nothing special but it was okay for breakfast. Cabin Crew were attentive.

### "I lost my flight"
I booked a flight Gulf Air from Dubai to Hyderabad via Bahrain. Flight was delay in Dubai 30min. When we reached in Bahrain no one announce flight left to Hyderabad. After checking with customer care they said we already calling customer. Hence I lost my flight. Then I book a return back ticket to Dubai. I asked on counter for my luggage they said we will loaded in Dubai flight. When I reached Dubai airport can't find my Luggage

### "Worst experience so far on an airline"
Worst experience on an airline, The flights were delayed due to  engineering work or late arrival on a previous flight. Cabin was too warm for the journey and my food was mediocre.

### "still we did not takeoff"
Over three hours delay while keeping the passengers inside the aircraft. The cabin was hot, no attention to the passengers and their complaints. We boarded the aircraft at 9:45 and now it is 1:15 still we did not takeoff.

### "advanced our flight 8 hours"
They advanced our flight 8 hours, then when we already arrived in Bahrain, they left us waiting in the terminal in Bahrain  without offering us any possibility to sit anywhere or go out into the city.

### "impressed by the cabin staff"
Gulf Air has only recently started flying out of Manchester so this is the first time I have had the chance to travel on this airline. It was a very good choice and was particularly impressed by the cabin staff who were friendly yet still very professional. Food was decent on both legs and I especially enjoyed "afternoon tea" on the Manchester-Bahrain leg. The lounge in Bahrain was superb, even had a golf simulator. Slight disappointment was the entertainment system both in the lack of choice offered and the censorship/editing which was a bit ridiculous on one film I decided to watch. However, at the price I paid compared with other comparable airlines, it was still excellent value.

### "have been ignored each time"
My flight in July 2021 from Malaga was delayed by 9 hours. The check in desk person gave me an email address to claim my EU compensation. I emailed their customer service to request a claim form and have been ignored each time.

### "denied to provide lounge access"
Very poor service. I had to leave to Bahrain from London on 9th September. The daily flight was delayed from 2 hours to more than 5 hours after checking the status for more than a month. Airline denied to provide lounge access after we waited a long time in the Airport.

### "Overall its value for money"
The ground service was very smooth in Chennai. I was expecting a huge crowd at the check in counter but i finished my check in within 10 mins. They changed my seat number before boarding, and upgraded my ticket to business class. The service was extremely good from Chennai to Bahrain. We had a transit time of 17 hours to Paris. They picked us from the airport and booked a room in a hotel. Provided lunch and breakfast and then dropped to airport. The flight to Paris was late by 50 mins. The service was comparatively not good. The temperature inside the aircraft was so chill they didn't provide extra blankets as well. The in-flight entertainment is limited. Overall its value for money.

### "173 EUR for 5 kgs extra"
Hyderabad to Paris via Bahrain. I mean, where do I even begin? First of all, there was the issue of "excess baggage" because Gulf Air adds on laptop bag and laptop as cabin luggage. They left me no choice but to pay 173 EUR for 5 kgs extra. The flight was delayed by 1.5 hours and it was so cold in the plane and they didn't even provide us blankets. Many passengers complained but to no avail. No headsets were provided for in-house entertainment. Barely made it my connecting flight to Paris. Even though the service from BAH to CDG was not bad, they lost my bag.

### "I reached 45 minutes before the flight"
I was late because there was an accident on the motorway. I reached 45 minutes before the flight. I was begging them to let me board the flight. They refused and said can't let me board the next flight as well because the travel agent from whom I purchased the tickets can do it. The travel agent also refused. I asked Gulf Air to charge me some extra money but they didn't help me at all. I called them every day till three months but they had been so rude. One of their colleagues said to me that my ticket was valid till one whole year because of the covid 19 policy and he said that he will do something but never got back to me.

### "service was great"
The flight was smooth and service was great. I didn’t take the food as I was had enjoyed lounge food prior to boarding. The entertainment system had new movies which I like even though it’s a short flight. I wish boarding was more organized where people boarded based on their rows/zones because it can get chaotic.

### "trips are almost always smooth"
Gulf Air is really not a bad airline when traveling regionally (within GCC) for me. They are always on time, the trips are almost always smooth from take off to landing. Service is great and I would definitely fly with them again. The only drawback is the price of the ticket tends to be steep compared to other airlines like Emirates.

### "worst cabin crew I experienced"
The aircraft were well maintained and new. The crew on the Tbilisi to Bahrain flight were very courteous and professional - the service was excellent and the vegetarian meal was very good. There was a delay of 50 minutes to the flight (not the fault of Gulf Air) but because the transit time was only an hour and fifteen minutes I had to run or I wouldn't have made it to the gate in time. The flight from Bahrain to Bengaluru was 80% empty. This should mean excellent service but that was not the case. The crew on this flight were the worst cabin crew I experienced and not interested in serving passengers. The crew served drinks only once during the entire journey. There was a choice of chicken or veg. Seeing that there were a lot of meals and that most passengers opted for the non-veg option I asked the staff to check if there is an extra vegetarian meal (I wasn't able to eat in Bahrain Airport because of the delay and was rather hungry as I didn't have breakfast that day). She said she will check but she never returned with one nor did she bother to come and tell me none were available. After the lights were turned off the crew migrated to the business class section which so the economy class section was service-less for almost half the journey. The food on the first leg was nice but on the second leg (night flight BAH to BLR on the 13th August arriving early morning on the 14th August) it was below average.

### "quality of food was lamentable"
A very disappointing experience and Gulf Air has deteriorated greatly since I used it regularly 5 to 10 years ago. Cabin crew were reasonably polite but not particularly helpful and couldn't solve any issue. The quality of food was lamentable. Even though my flight via Singapore was very long and at night, no blankets or pillows were available. Toilets were dirty and cabin crew did not seem at all concerned to keep them clean. Gulf Air seems to have become on a par with the most basic budget airlines.

### "Seating was comfortable"
Return flight with Gulf Air, Bus boarding from terminal, entering aircraft was so hot aircon not on. Offered a welcome drink lemon and mint of course was needed in the warmth. Was asked to move seat so husband and wife could sit together, no problems. Wasn't offered pyjamas, skipped over by cabin crew and wasn't asked for my dinner options till just before take-off, again missed by cabin crew. Inflight entertainment wasn't working, had to ask 3 times for it to be fixed. Food onboard was amazing, plentiful, hot, fresh. Seating was comfortable with its massage function.

### "food was average at most"
For me, Gulf Air is the best option for regional (GCC) flights as the planes take off on time and the service is okay. The food was average at most and the FAs are fairly attentive. I haven’t flown with Gulf Air for long hauls for 11 years so I can’t judge them for that. The seats were comfortable and had good leg space.

### "1 hour flights with Gulf Air are always almost effortless"
1 hour flights with Gulf Air are always almost effortless. The service and food are decent. IFE is good to kill some time but nothing compared to other big regional airlines. I like the new planes as they have big screens for economy and quite comfortable legroom.

### "Bahrain to Chennai was terrible."
I have traveled to London to Chennai and the first leg of the travel was bit okay but the second leg from Bahrain to Chennai was terrible. I asked for a non veg meal and they said we dont have and not offered any kind of alternatives. Next time my friend asked for a cup of water where the cabin crew said "Cant you see we were busy?

### "seats were decently comfortable"
A flight tracking application showed that the entire week’s flights were all late, and mine was 42 mins late. Meal service was miserable, a sandwich roll. IFE movie selection boasted a total of 12 movies. At least the legroom and seats were decently comfortable. The cabin crew worked tirelessly.

### "had not been cleaned"
I was informed two days before my travel that the airline had moved back to Terminal 4 LHR, and the lounge was not opening for another week, i would have expected for a business class passenger alternative arrangement's with another airline would have been made, I was not offered anything. I was greeted on board and shown to my seat, which had not been cleaned, crumbs over the floor and in the IFE hand set holder, the crew arranged for a cleaner to attend & apologised. Food service a disappointment from how things used to be, from the plating up and display to the quality of food served, the main meal was served directly on to the tray table with a table cloth and a napkin given, for the smaller snack meals were given. ls these were served on a tray the same size as used in economy, no napkins / serviette where given. The sweet trolley was not used. The meal on the Bahrain to Manila sector was no more than what was served in economy. The welcome drink was greatly appreciated, its a good class of champers they serve, I was asked what drink i would like after take off and again i chose the champers, this was the only time i was offered a drink. Where has that middle Eastern hospitality gone? Gulf Air, you have the best seats with privacy in the sky, you were way up there with the others before, don't let it slip any more.

### "we were denied complementary room"
Traveled from London via Bahrain to Mumbai. If we have layovers above 7 hrs and ticket value over 450USD then passenger are entitled for complementary room. We had 8 hr layover at Bahrain but flight got delayed 2.5 hrs and when we reached Bahrain we had only 6 hr layover left and due to which we were denied complementary room. Its like we suffered 3 hr check in line at the London airport then 6.5hr flight took more the 9hr (aircraft time) and now we are be denied of room as well. So Gulf Air do not have rewards for its passengers. Also the staff is very rude and unpolite. Even after requesting they don't serve water and at Bahrain when i requested for the room they said flight got delayed at London, we cant help in any way, not even some food voucher its like its passengers fault that flight got delayed. Even after requesting they could not even provide 5$ worth of food vouchers.

### "cabin crew were friendly and hard working"
GF is a ok airline. The cabin crew were friendly and hard working even though on all my sectors (LHR-BAH-BKK and back again) the plane was completely full. The plane inside was quite clean and the food was mostly good out of London and Bahrain, not out of Bangkok though. Drinks were served regularly and they oblige when you ask for one. I don't mind travelling with them again.

### "No pillows were available"
Not Verified |  Food came so late, drinks too. No pillows were available. FA explained that they forgot to load them in Bahrain. Toilets were dirty. My food was disgusting, and items missing, like water.

### Gulf Air customer review
Not Verified |  Flight from Kuwait to Bahrain was smooth. No particular problems to report as it’s only a 1h flight. Now comes the Bahrain to Bangkok leg. Flight was on time but pillows were missing on the seat. Service was a real mess. Food arrived 2 hours into the flight, unorganized FAs, drinks followed an hour after food. It seemed that the FAs didn’t have any training. There were only 4 FAs for the whole economy cabin. Serious lack of organisation. Maybe that’s why the ticket was cheap. Cheap tickets equals cheap service.

### "The food service needs to improve"
The food service needs to improve. I was offered a cold veg roll from Dubai to Bahrain with no other choice. And from Bahrain to Dubai some were offered a choice between a chicken or veg shawarma. However, as they ran out of chicken, I was told that the veg roll was the only thing on offer. The flight was quite empty as I had three seats to myself. I think catering could have been more effective.

### "half a day wasted"
Not Verified | One of the worst airlines and customer care - I was made spend 3 hrs for phone booking due to their website, and finally some abnormal price was quoted against the actual price shared on the website. Then again, they wanted me to send the price from the website as a screenshot to proceed with booking. My half a day was wasted booking with them. Thank god I decided not to proceed with them. Never book or fly through them.

### "I was delayed by their slow system"
Gulf Air refused me entry into my flight because their system did not update to show that I had bought extra luggage. The time taken to show that I had in fact booked it caused the delay and the lateness. The price paid for the extra luggage for myself and my mother did not carry over onto the next flight. I spoke to a Gulf Air agent, who told me that they will rectify the situation if I paid a £14 fee for my mother and £150 for myself. I reluctantly agreed do this. I then receive a call from Gulf Air who said that because my mother had initially booked her flight with an agency (lastminute.com), the fees would need to be increased to £314. I reluctantly agreed as I was in a desperate position. I then received an email that informs me that changing my ticket to the night time one was now £300, and not the £150 mentioned; this was despite the fact that I had booked with Gulf Air directly; which contradicts what they had said earlier about the agency. I then call them to ask about this new pricing; an agent answers me very patronisingly and essentially asks "are you going to pay or not?". So in total; I coughed out an additional £968 because I was delayed by their slow system in the first place (£314 for my mum, £300 for me, and combined loss of £354 of baggage). Seems like they can talk how they like with customers with no accountability. Their prices are good, but there's a reason for it.

### "has improved a lot"
London to Lahore via Bahrain. I have been a frequent flyer on Gulf Air and was assigned front seats on both travel legs. Gulf Air has improved a lot but a few things need some improvement. The drink service is too late as I finished my main meal without any drink and they gave the drinks when all passengers were being served the main meal which I felt was not helpful. Secondly, the IFE lacked variety and had limited choice. Transit was smooth however they changed the aircraft at the last minute and as I result half of my luggage came in the next flight which was in the evening. I had to travel 4 hours from my home the next day to collect it from Airport which was really annoying. The good on BAH-LHE leg needs a lot of improvement and again the drinks were served long after I finished my meal.

### "system showed all seats were reserved"
Gulf Air's online check-in system showed all seats were reserved except those that a passenger needs to pay for. I paid £20 to reserve a seat but when I boarded the plane it was almost empty. Gulf Air staff told me to contact Customer Services if I wanted a refund, I did and they keep sending me a automated reference number and a message saying we will contact you soon. It has been over a month now and I have had no explanation. The flight experience was poor too.

### "Gulf Air were brilliant"
Gulf Air were brilliant. Check in easy, Crew friendly and polite. Food and drink plentiful and lots of choice. Plane was spotless and flights smooth. Seats were comfy and lie flat was great. Lounge at Bahrain clean and new. Dinner and drinks were very good and had shower to Freshen up. Bar staff in lounge really friendly and great service. BA execs should book a flight and remind themselves of what business class is all about.

### "no concern for customer convenience"
I had a booking from Muscat to Cairo via Bahrain. My flight from Muscat was scheduled to arrive at 4.35 pm in Bahrain, and the Bahrain to Cairo leg departs at 5.15 pm. About 48 hours before the travel time, I received a message from Gulf Air informing of the cancellation of the Bahrain to Cairo flight. I was re-booked on an earlier flight that same morning leaving Bahrain at 10.15 a.m, with no change in my Muscat to Bahrain flight. The Gulf Air call center offered to book me on another day, but that was not an option for me. They informed me a refund of my ticket requires 90 working days to process. I had no other choice but to re-book myself with another airline out of Muscat. I checked the status of previous 5.15 pm Gulf Air flights to Cairo, and the majority of these flights were cancelled. It seems Gulf Air sells tickets for flights they do not intend to operate unless fully booked, with no concern for customer convenience. I feel that instead of receiving the service I purchased from Gulf Air, I ended up providing the company with a 3-month interest-free loan equivalent to the value of the ticket I purchased.

### "Overall, the flight was great"
We travelled with Gulf Air from Heathrow to Bahrain. We also took a connecting flight to Dubai Overall the 7 hour flight to Bahrain was good. We had a long delay in the plane for an hour 1 hour 30, due to some baggage issues, so we had to wait. However, after take off, I decided to purchase Wi-Fi for USD 15 (£12). There was a cheaper option but that was for messages only. I can confidently say the on board WiFi was amazing. I was on FaceTime with my friends for 4 hours. It was fast and worked exceptionally. The food on board was chicken and rice. This was nice and one of the first times I enjoyed plane food. As we flew over Turkey, I decided to get some sleep as the seats were comfortable. Overall, the flight was great.

### "Keep up the good service Gulf Air"
Not Verified |  I traveled on Gulf Air from London to Dubai via Bahrain on 14 December 2021 on the 21.50 night flight for pre Christmas break, I was very happy with the aircraft, it was wide-bodied and the seating was comfortable and spacious. The service on the plane was excellent and the cabin crew were very polite, they served with a smile the Swahili speaking staff member was the pick of the lot, she was very polite and very professional. Gulf is an excellent airline and with their new airport in Bahrain now will be at par with other richer airlines. Keep up the good service Gulf Air.

### "my flight has been cancelled"
I booked my ticket with Gulf Air in October 2021 and paid £3325.39 for two tickets. I was due to fly to Dhaka, Bangladesh from London Heathrow and return on 7 March 2022. Gulf Air sent me a message today, 16 November 2021 that my flight has been cancelled. I checked on-line and found that Gulf Air is still selling tickets for the 8 December 2021 flight and 7 March 2022 but at much higher price. This means that Gulf Air did not cancel flight but they have cancelled my tickets so that they can sell them for higher price.

### "the whole experience was brilliant"
We booked our family holiday to Dubai with Gulf Air mainly because of the price difference compared to Emirates and Etihad. I was a bit apprehensive because of some negative reviews but the whole experience was brilliant from check in at Heathrow to the friendliness of all the staff on board both airplanes. The food was excellent and was even provided on the short flight from Bahrain to Dubai. The experience was identical for the return journey. The only negative was the choice for inflight entertainment. They do not have the selection of movies like Emirates. But overall a good experience. Will definitely use them again.

### "told that a GDFRA return permit was required"
On 28 August my wife and I arrived at Istanbul Airport (IST) to check-in for our Gulf Air flight back to Dubai (DXB). We are both residents of the UAE and checked all the return entry requirements to board the flight. This includes a negative PCR Test, residency VISA and a valid passport. This did not include a GDFRA return permit as we had not visited a red zone country in the last 14 days (or in the last six months for that matter). Moreover whilst my wife holds a Dubai VISA, I myself have an Abu Dhabi residence VISA which means I cannot apply for a GDFRA return permit (as these are only for Dubai VISA holders), but instead can apply for an ICA (Identity and Citizenship Authority) return permit, which is applicable to holders of VISAs issued by all the other Emirates of the UAE, excluding Dubai. We approached the check-in counter at which time we were immediately told that a GDFRA return permit was required for ALL passengers flying to Dubai regardless of VISA. Moreover it was explained to us that all passengers in the previous weeks flying to Dubai had all had GDFRA return permits regardless of VISA (please note that this is impossible due to the aforementioned reason). Despite this situation we indicated that we would attempt to complete the application form online. Even approaching the local merchants to make use of their computers. When this failed the Gulf Air staff indicated that we should speak with the Emirates ticketing office and airline check-in staff (located on the complete opposite side of the airport) as they could explain in better detail the requirements to fly to Dubai. We proceeded to walk with all our luggage and no assistance from Gulf Air to the other side of the airport. However after speaking with the Emirates staff they confirmed our understanding that a GDFRA was not necessary in our circumstance, confirming the initial information in this complaint. Upon return to the Gulf Airline check-in counter we explained to the Counter manager what Emirates had said and we were met with severe hostility. She directed two of her staff to accompany us back to the Emirates check-in counter, telling one of them what we had told her, but in an extremely rude tone indicative of a person who believed that we were lying. My wife even tried to deescalate the situation, but the manager was so incredibly hostile and rude that further communication with her became counter-productive. We therefore proceeded back to the Emirates counter with the Gulf Air Staff, one of whom along the way informed my wife that they did not care for our situation and that we were in fact wasting their time and, as indicated above, reiterated that every passenger going to Dubai in the last few weeks had a GDFRA regardless of the VISA they held. This Gulf Air staff member was so rude he actually stopped assisting my wife with her bag and left us half way. Once back at the Emirates counter the Emirates staff explained to the remaining Gulf Air staff member that had not abandoned us that we did not require a GDFRA, however as the Gulf Air staff was apparently insisting on a document that was impossible to obtain, the Emirates staff themselves attempted to assist us in vain. I want to emphasize this point, that another airline's staff attempted to help us more than the Gulf Air staff with whom we had booked our tickets.

### "offered a poor service"
Not Verified |  I had booked my flight from London to Dhaka via Bahrain and had booked a VGML (specific diet meal). Firstly the cabin crew obviously held a record of my specified requested meal although the air hostess lamely advised me that aircraft catering services had forgotten to load my specified order meal. For that reason I had travelled on a six hour flight without consumption of any food. I noticed during the whole flight that only one meal consisting of only a vegetable dish was served. All the passengers on board were extremely angry and frustrated. Your a world renowned and reputable airline yet your cabin crew portrayed this type of negative behaviour and offered a poor service. This is extremely unacceptable. I reported to the flight manager regarding my ordered/requested specific diet meal only to be told their sorry and that it is an error on the aircraft catering services side. However I am extremely worried now as I have booked a return flight to London on 27th October 2021 and that I will have to fly without the consumption of any food on board! I am a border line diabetic therefore I need to consume food at regular intervals otherwise I can not stabilise my insulin levels for long.

### "Staff was very friendly"
Great experience we had with the service provided by this crew. Our family of 2 flew from Heathrow to Bahrain and they were very attentive to detail. Our seat had plenty of space and we were lucky the airplane wasn't full. Staff was very friendly with the kids which made our journey nice and smooth. The food quality was great and there was plenty. The staff was very prompt to help. Can't thank enough the crew!

### "Dismissed by rude staff"
11 hours layover now means no hotel, no lounge access and no food and drink vouchers. Dismissed by rude staff at the transfer desk with the excuse of covid. I managed to pay for a hotel at the airport easily so it's nothing to do with covid and everything to do with money. The food on board was pathetic. I'm sticking with Qatar Airways from now on. Never again!

### "book all of us for a flight next day"
We flew from Karachi to Bahrain to LHR. The journey, as long as it was already was supposed to continue to JFK on an AA flight sold on the same itinerary by Gulf. Due to a significantly late departure from Bahrain, the aircraft arrived late to LHR. The airline ground staff gathered 24 or so passengers from the flight and put them on a bus to T5 from T2 at LHR. Upon getting to T5, we were informed by AA that the gates are closed and they had informed Gulf already and that we needed to go back to T2 and deal with Gulf. This yo-yoing happened a few times. To make matters worse, since all 24 or so passengers were coming from red listed COVID countries, going through immigration and outside would have triggered a 10 day mandatory quarantine. The airport staff located and got a Gulf representative to come in and book all of us for a flight next day. He also gave the passengers a speech about how Gulf has done everything they can without even a simple apology. When we asked for pillows and blankets for the passengers, we were told Gulf has done all it can. All they provided were measly food vouchers. A number of the passengers are elderly and the treatment by Gulf has been ridiculous.

### "cancelled my return flight"
I travelled on Gulf Air with my 3 Months old Daughter in Jun 21, Travel was not very comfortable but the problem start when Gulf Air cancelled my return flight in July 21 and when i contacted them they said i need to speak to Agent to rebook even after explaining it is not agent who cancelled my flight, it is Gulf Air who cancelled its scheduled operation and it is their responsibility to give me alternate available date but they were very rude & unhelpful to listen anything. When i travelled last time with Qatar Airways and Emirates due to covid-19 they both also cancelled their schedule flights and both Airline staff helped me without any hustle in within 3 minutes emailed me my new ticket with alternate available flight. Gulf Air need to upgrade its 3rd world country`s policies & Staff Training before increasing the routes or Aircraft.

### Gulf Air customer review
Gulf Air experience was extremely unpleasant. I purchased a ticket that is supposed to be refundable and also possible to change without any cost. Due to urgent reasons, I needed to get it changed or refunded and I requested it according to the policy (before 24 hours of the flight time). I'd have to wait for a minimum of 30 minutes on hold to be able to speak to customer services. When I asked if I could change it, they refused to help, so that now I'd need to buy a new ticket.

### "told the ticket had expired"
Not Verified |  Deplorable customer service. After having my flight cancelled in March 2020 due to Covid 19, Gulf Air issued a ticket which I was told could be used to book another flight within 12 months. After finally reaching a customer service representative on an international call, only to be told the ticket had expired and that it was 12 months from the initial purchase of September 2019! During this period I was unable to book my flights as they were unavailable from Gulf Air? How can a goods or service expire when it was never provided, surely this is a breach of contract?

### "refused to board me and my family"
Lahore to Dubai via Bahrain. Gulf Air refused to board me and my family. They refused to give reason of refusal in writing. Verbally they told it is advise from Bahrain office. We had valid family visa and traveled 3 days later on a different airline. Gulf Air further applied cancellation charges. They never responded to my complaint lodged at their site. This complaint has all details and contact information.

### "refund amount wasn't returned"
I flew with Gulf Air from Bahrain to London on September 2019, it wasn't a pleasant flight due to long ques, slow service, clear lack of manpower in the airport, and abysmal treatment in the plane (had to wait 1/2 hour to get a pillow for my child). I wasn't planning to utilize that airlines again, but unfortunately, due to lack of other options, I had to book my flight back on March 30th, 2020 through Gulf Air to Dammam, Saudi Arabia. But then travel restrictions to Saudi from Bahrain were imposed, and I had to cancel my flight. Even though their official website refund policy states that the refund cost is 10BD (30 USD), and it would take no more than 1 month to be completed. I was informed that it would cost a 100BD (350USD) penalty, and would take 2-3 months to be processed. So far, it's been a month and a half, and still the refund amount wasn't returned to my account. By the way, when I called to cancel the flight, it was an international call, and I had to wait on-hold for approximately 25 minutes until someone responded. Overall, I wouldn't recommend this airlines to anyone, and I will still pursue my refund amount, as I heard from a friend that he never got his refund even after 3 months for his flight.

### "little glitches Gulf Air should address"
London to Bahrain in Business Class , Having flown their A330's before, I was looking forward to experience the difference in their 787's. Firstly, the seat is a 2x2x2 configuration, with open suite style seating. The window seats (which I chose), offered privacy once the screen was raised up. And every seat has direct aisle access. The seat is fabulous, comfortable, with all the adjustments including a massage function, except for the headphone socket which was a difficult to see as it was hidden in a darker area by the seat. I loved the windows, which could be darken and lightened. There is little storage space, but if you were not stretching out to a full flat bed, the front area underneath the TV monitor allowed for an ample storage area. The Amenity Kit was basic, but they did provide PJ's even on the daylight flights. However, the IFE is very limited, with a small selection of movies and programmes. Service was a mixed bag. While welcoming and friendly, the cabin crew were non-engaging, instead providing the service in a professional and swift manner. There were the usual welcome drinks including champagne, with top ups offered, dates, Arabic Coffee and hot & cold towels throughout. I still cannot get over the gimmick of the onboard chef, as I just cannot see the advantage - and wish they didn't take the menus away. I wanted to see the wine list again, but was offered just red or white (two choices), but didn't see the bottle nor was I able to taste first. These are little glitches Gulf Air should address to improve their product to near perfection. The food in general was very tasty and I love their signature dish of Lamb Shank, proper afternoon Cream Teas and so on. I had to curtail my trip due to the pandemic, and the return flight was understandably basic. No hot food, no pillows, no blankets, PJ's etc and disposable plastic cutlery.

### "never fly this airline again"
Not Verified |  I was traveling from Paris to Delhi via Bahrain on 17th March. While boarding at Paris,the management said that your flight from Bahrain to Delhi has been cancelled. The management said don't worry we will transfer you to some other airlines. When we reached Bahrain, Gulf Air was helpless,they left us stranded for 18 hours without food and accommodation and they made us wait for 18 hours and then transferred us in GF134 on 18th March next day at 14:15. After that, we were 11 passengers travelling from Paris, out of 11, 9 were given business class upgrade and me and other Indian guy was left out. Asking for my rights is a crime? It was so humiliating, but I'm proud of my identity and I decided I will never fly this airline again.

### "Very unprofessional service"
Not Verified |  London to Kochi via Bahrain. Very unprofessional service. There was shortage of food and I was offered something which I don’t eat. The touch screen of the tv was not working hence could use it.

### "would not fly with them again"
London to Kochi via Bahrain. The flight from London to Bahrain was alright. However in the second flight form Bahrain to Kochi the plane was very old. Service was rude and food quality poor. Same in the return in the flight from Kochi to Bahrain the plane was very old, clearly outdated. I would not fly with them again, it was scary.

### "Lovely business class"
Bahrain to Bangkok with Gulf Air. Lovely business class. As soon as you find your seat, they will greet you with a welcome drink. Chef will take the food order after. Amenity kit, pjs available. Beds not that comfortable though. Overall: kind staff, roomy business class. Would fly with them again.

### "seats are not comfortable"
Male to Bahrain. The flight is usually very cramped and seats are not comfortable. The main problem we had during our return flight from our honeymoon was that we had been told that we would not be able to sit together as the flight was full (upon booking we were assured the seats would be together). Even though we could see that the two rows behind us were completely empty and not in use at all. Once the flight had taken off the air hostesses were continuously hovering over us trying to get to the overhead cabinets above us (a problem we would not have had had they seated us a row behind), at which point two big baskets had been dropped by one of the staff, directly hitting my head and my husbands phone. She did not once check to see during the flight if I was okay and we did not approach anyone else regarding this until leaving the aircraft so that we wouldn’t have to deal with any hostility or uncomfortable atmosphere for the rest of the 5 hour flight (the hostesses on this flight did not come across as very friendly). We are absolutely appalled with our first experience of gulf air.

### "flight is overloaded"
Bahrain to Delhi. I booked my ticket before one month but when it’s times to fly, Gulf air staff giving reasons that flight is overloaded, there is not space. I had work in Delhi, there was arranged couples of things. If next time I’ll fly with this airline, I have to think many time. Now who’s responsible for this. Who will pay my expense. Even they have not arranged another flight, they were giving options for next day flight.

### "thank the team at Paris"
Paris to Bahrain. My review is to thank the team at Paris airport - very welcome helping in each request and solving problems. It was a family trip and really top service. Excellent team. The flight was also very good and excellent crew.

### "staff on the plane were impeccable"
I was somewhat sceptical in picking Gulf Air for my Christmas trip to the Philippines. The reviews were not overly great, neither is their reputation (most I spoke to had not heard of this airline). The flight times were not great either. The price however was the sticking point and offered the cheapest method of flying to the Philippines for the Christmas period. The Gulf Air fleet is relatively modern. The dreamliner I rode in had plenty of foot-room and the interior was very pleasant to the eye. All my connecting flights were extremely comfortable. My return flight did have a slightly annoying whining noise from the toilet near the entrance to the plane. It sounded more like a technical issue with the bathroom flushing mechanism as it only stopped periodically when people went to the bathroom! The inflight entertainment was extremely responsive, more responsive than any other that I have used before. Regrettably the same cannot be said for the range of content available to watch. I found the offering limited. The staff on the plane were impeccable and worked extremely hard from start to finish. The food can only be described as very average. Certainly better than Etihad's atrocious recent food offering on their long haul product. It does not however meet the same level of standard that befits Qatar Airways or Singapore Airlines. A definite area to improve I think! The worst experience I had was the Bahrain terminal. You are forced to go through security upon arrival for your transit. If you have a tight connection there is no urgency to prioritise those customers, often most people were shoving their way past in the queue to try and meet the connection. Meanwhile the staff were somewhat carefree and very brazenly dismissed the concerns of those passengers. I know from experience it's likely the plane would not leave and be held back slightly, but that reassurance for other passengers was not there. Instead they are forced to queue in what is a seamlessly endless line in an non-air-conditioned room. With only 2 security checkpoints it was woefully inefficient. My return flight to London required a 2nd security check at the actual gate, whereas my first flight to Manila (or any other visible flight) did not, Why? If you are to have security at the gate, be consistent and do it for all gates (Like Changi airport) and at least make the transiting customers have a positive experience. Facilities at the Bahrain terminal are Ok. McDonalds, Costas, enough seating. The building aesthetically is not like any other big airline terminal, but it's okay for what it is. Ground staff - I found rude really and inefficient. My return flight to London insisted on a 2nd security check at the gate with a very forceful and intimidating manner against the passengers already present, the whole process was chaotic, to be herded into a separate section. They tore our boarding passes but we had not actually boarded. So we couldn't leave the closed off area to go to the toilet if needed. When we finally started boarding, it was not done in a Zoned manner. Which meant the boarding process took twice as long. It felt a very frustrating experience. My initial flight to Manila was nothing like this. Though the member of staff processing passengers onto the Manila flight from Bahrain did not actually open my passport to check against my boarding pass, which is frankly shocking. Workers from retail shops were extremely courteous and friendly.

### "Gulf Air is an underrated airline"
Gulf Air is an underrated airline. At first I was hesitant in using Gulf Air since most of the reviews about them are not good. When I saw that they are using 787 on their MNL flight I told to myself why not try their airline. On board MNL flight I was surprised that they have a chef and nanny on board. On the ground they also distribute pyjamas with slippers. They are offering dinner for their 1st service and breakfast before landing, foods are tasty. I like their business class layout compared to Emirates, Etihad and Saudia (B777). Their seats are comfortable but they need to improve their in-flight entertainment at least add more movies. I enjoyed my flight and I was able to sleep during the flight. Highly recommended.

### "not a great experience"
Bahrain to Kuwait. The flight was full and had a delay in departure. It was not a great experience this time as lots of passengers shouting in the plane. Even during take off & landing they were walking in the plane but cabin crew didn't do anything. In my view cabin crew could have done little more efficiency during the flight to make passengers comfortable. Seats were unclean.

### "everything was in order"
Kuwait to Bahrain. Was a short flight of 50 minutes. Departed on time. Snacks and beverages served though it was low standard. Overall everything was in order, nothing to appreciate or to criticise.

### "a lot of gate changes"
Not recommended if its a transit flight. There is a lot of gate changes, you could miss your flight and they will make you pay for another ticket. Bahrain airport is a small and bad one.

### "not allowed to board the flight"
London to New Delhi via Bahrain. Highly disappointed. We were not allowed to board the flight inspite of being 55 minutes before departure from London. We did not get any assistance and they  said we cannot let you travel. The help desk at the airport also said we have to purchase another ticket from Gulf Air as our return ticket would be canceled if we board some other carrier to India. So we had to purchase another ticket and will travel tomorrow and pay charges for rescheduling and ticket price difference.

### "missed the connecting flight"
I've flown with them on 25 Sep 2019, when the plane suffered from technical failure. We have to wait on the plane for 2 hours and the gate (another 3 hours). They provided us with sandwiches and beverages (which not enough). Service on the plane was no problem though. We arrived at Bahrain 6 hours late, thus I have missed the connecting flight, at least they gave us a hotel and meals. We forced to stay in Bahrain for 22 hours. They do have a flight to BKK in the morning but didn't relocate the seats to us.

### "refused to give me boarding pass"
Bangalore to Amman via Bahrain. We reached the counter at 1 am. First the staff at the counter started asking me why I was going to Jordan and wanted to see my return tickets. I asked them why as neither were they immigration officers nor visa authorities. They refused to give me the boarding pass. My friends who were joining me for the holiday trip (two with US Passport) and 2 of us with Indian passport were subjected to the same questions. They wanted to see all the hotel bookings in Jordan, needed an explanation of why we had not booked the return tickets from Amman. Our travel was to Turkey after Jordan and not back to India. By then another Gulf Air staff  said if you go to Jordan you will have to book tickets to and fro by Gulf. I told him no such thing was written in the policies of Visa Jordan or while booking Gulf Air. According to him Jordan visa on arrival can deport many Indians and Gulf airlines have to bring them back. I told him that by sheer chance if Jordan believes in deporting 4 ladies holidaying in Jordan then we have sufficient funds to buy tickets and come back. He also asked us how much money we were carrying? Whether we have a copy of our bank balance. We spent more than 1.5 hours arguing with this staff of Gulf Air, in this era and times. Later we realised that his issue was that he wanted us to book the ticket from Gulf Air. When we reached Jordan, the immigration officials didn't ask all the 4 of us a single question our visas were stamped in seconds.

### "I will never fly Gulf Air again"
After having an amazing discovery of Oman Air, I wanted to try Gulf Air’s business class as it was basically the same aircraft, same type of seats and additionally it had a Sky Chef on board. I was expecting even better service than Oman Air. Gulf Air has the same type of aircraft 787 and same type of seats. The seats are just amazing. Specially the window seats are private suites. This is where the good part ends with Gulf Air experience I had for the 4 business class trips I just completed. First of all no Champagne was served for the welcome drinks which is a standard for any airline on business class. I had to request it. With a strange look on her face, FA did bring me a glass. Then the food order came and I had to inform the sky chef I had ordered a special meal. He didn’t have on his manifesto. No one greeted or mentioned any passenger by name. Almost everyone had special meals and they all got mixed up. Sky Chef plus a purser plus 3 FA for 6 passenger (most of the seats were empty). They couldn’t figure out who and what. There isn’t a wine list. They ask you white or red. Italian or French. I requested Italian red and my partner French red. FA brought one bottle to everyone :)) and served. When I asked for a glass of water (a water glass was on my food tray yet empty) the old purser indicated a bottled water next to my bed. I informed him I rather use it if I wake up during the flight thirsty. He brought me another bottle. worse part comes before the landing. I requested just coffee no breakfast. Same for all other 5 passengers except one. The old male purser informed us that they closed the kitchen (60 min before landing?). Yet he did open a service and served a Bahraini customer. This is when it all went wrong as one passenger demanded breakfast as well. Purser was so rude that he informed us that this passenger was their special guest as he is a frequent traveller. Entertainment is a joke. There is just a few movies, few series - all very old. You must beg to get anything done. I had to demand for a pajamas and mattress for all my flights although this was what they have been advertising. Amenity kit is very cheap. After 4 flights which all had same issues, my advice is to use Oman Air as they also have similar price offers. I will never fly Gulf Air again. Avoid this airline by any means.

### "We were treated like criminals"
Bengaluru to Paris via Bahrain. Extremely unprofessional, incompetent staff. They held my husband up at Bahrain Airport on Sept 14 2018 during our transfer to Paris without giving any reason. There were no immigration or travel document problem or even luggage security. They just held him without telling him any reason. After being held up for about 7 hours at Bahrain Airport, he was cleared to board the next flight to Paris that night. Again, no reason was given when we asked why he was held. We were treated like criminals. They did not show us any official communication mentioning any reason as to why were being held up. We lost an entire day of our trip because of this. I have filed multiple complaints, no adequate response from them. I even emailed their CCO, but got no satisfactory response. They wouldn't tell us the reason and wouldn't respond. Pathetic customer care service. Do not fly with this airline ever.

### "Cabin Crew services has improved"
Kuwait to Bangkok via Bahrain in March 2019(Business Class and was really impressed with their fantastic Boeing 787-9 (Bahrain - Bangkok) , though there were some poor service issues. I compromised it with the marvelous window seat of the B787-9 with the super privacy. Last month when I decided to fly in the same sector, I got a good deal on Gulf Air Business Class, same sector & same aircraft. This time what I noticed much was the Cabin Crew services has improved much better than the earlier flight but the food need to be improved. The Passenger announcement made was with crystal clear voice.

### "they don't even smile"
Not Verified |  I flew economy class on  B787-9 from Manila to Bahrain. The food was delicious though they don't offer you a menu as the variety of meals is low. There is a chance if you don't fly in the B787-9 then you don't get IFE content at all and if IFE is available it has outdated content and they do not update it quite frequently. There is a lack of focus on content and simple things they should do like updating their IFE frequently, Adding more variety of options in food, meals and snacks and making their staff more hospitable as they don't even smile or greet / welcome you upon entering of exiting the aircraft. The B787-9 is new as the seats, the leg-room is plenty as I am a tall male and I could fit my legs comfortably. Although, the support for your back isn't great even with a pillow. You'll feel like there is a lack of padding to support your lower back or maybe I am just very tall.

### "impressed with Gulf Air flights"
Paris to Colombo via Bahrain and I was extremely impressed with Gulf Air flights, cabin crew and onboard food and beverage service. Food was very tasty and they have a very good choice of alcoholic and non alcoholic beverage selection. A320-200 flights were pretty old and their entertainment systems were outdated, and on the Colombo sector all Hollywood movies are blocked for some unknown reason. On 787 flights pretty good entertainment system. Cabin crew were very friendly and happy to assist you on your requests, Only complain I have is when landing in night time, they do not dim the cabin lights, this is not a good practice.

### "flight was disappointing"
Kozhikode to Bahrain. I chose to fly Gulf Air business class since it had been many years since I last flew with them. I upgraded my tickets to Business Class to avail the extra baggage and smooth check in services at Bahrain Airport. The flight was disappointing in many ways. There was no Movies available on the Entertainment system, just old TV series that were quite boring. The food was good but nothing outstanding. The seats are old and don't really go all the way back and the food rest is quite hard to pull out. Also they didn't let us board first for some reason.

### "Avoid if you can"
London to Abu Dhabi via Bahrain. The cabins are not cleaned properly. I had biscuit crumbs on my seat belt and gum on the food tray from the previous passenger. You are not given a menu card. Cabin crew pass by and ask if you want chicken or lamb. If you are asleep or distracted while you watch your movie, they simply walk past unless you wave to them. On short-haul flights, you are given a cold chicken sandwich. Lack of coke is also unacceptable. Onboard entertainment system also seems lacklustre. There are a handful of Hollywood or Bollywood movies and nothing else to watch. The cabin crew hardly smile or want to talk to you. Significant overhaul is required. Avoid if you can.

### "experience was very mediocre"
Flying from Moscow to Dubai via Bahrain on 9 May, back on 13 May and the experience was very mediocre. The flight from MOW do Dubai- onboard staff was impolite even rude to passengers, meals were under average, during a 5h flight drinks were offered only once, entertainment system did not work at all. Seats were very uncomfortable and space between the rows smaller than usual. The flight had a delay of one hour so I missed my connecting Gulf Air flight from Bahrain to Dubai. When dealing with the Gulf Air ground personnel in Bahrain- chaotic, incompetent, talking to 3-4 customers at once, simply a disaster. They suggested me to wait at the airport in the middle of the night for 5 hours for the next flight, then put me on an Etihad flight to Abu Dhabi when I asked them to (which was 1h late too btw.). They also issued a confirmation of the delay for me and advised to ask for an upgrade when flying back in 4 days. From Dubai to Moscow I was unexpectedly (I only found out when boarding in Bahrain) upgraded to the business class for the leg Bahrain-Moscow. Again- the entertainment system did not work, the seat was broken as the leg support did not work properly. At least this one was on time. I fly on average ca. 20 flights a year for the last 15 years and this was certainly not the worst experience (Ukrainian Airlines was) but one of those below the average. I was especially disappointed by the staff behaviour in the economic class on the leg from Moscow to Bahrain.

### "service is absolutely appalling"
London to Dhaka via Bahrain. Customer service is absolutely appalling. They will extort every single penny from you. Plane dirty, food ridiculous. Timetable non existent. Too many faults to mention so I'll leave it there as I've had enough of this airline. For a middle Eastern airline this is shameful as your neighbours are doing an exceptional job than you.

### "Price was ridiculously cheap"
London to Bangkok via Bahrain. Price was ridiculously cheap booked a week prior to departure. Free seat selection 24 hours prior to departure. Aircraft: Nearly new Boeing 787-900 with decent seat pitch and immaculately clean. Poor seat width as with all 9 abreast carriers.so vacant adjacent seat welcome. IFE: Reasonable choice but could be expanded. Nice too that no IFE boxes under seat limiting leg room as with some carriers. Service: Nice to have an amenity kit on night flights (but dental kit inside would be good) Food, nothing to rave about but appropriate for times and flight length. Cabin staff were not overly warm or welcoming but did what they had to do. Bahrain Airport: Shambles and useless. Would choose again for the right price.

### "Mannerless crew"
Bangalore to Istanbul via Manama. Traveller for past 20 years and this is the worst maintained airline I have seen. Mannerless crew, always delayed, poor quality food, no maintenance are their only Pros. Budget airline like AirAsia is far better than this one. Every time at all airports gate numbers will / must changes several times until departure.

### "great in flight services"
Not Verified |  I travelled from London to Islamabad via Bahrain on 04/04/2019. I arrived at Bahrain airport on 05/04/2019. The Gulf Air Line already arranged accommodation, food and transport as I had 18 hours layover. The driver turned up to pick me up from the airport to the hotel. I wasn't aware of the hotel but when I got there it was a 5 star hotel and room was spacious. It was 09.25am when I got in the hotel and the receptionist was very professional and he told me that you can have breakfast, buffet lunch and dinner (all inclusive) and tonight at 10.30pm our driver will drop you off at the airport as my flight was at 12.40am. Really feeling blessed as the quality services has been provided overall. I traveled in the Boeing 787 and it was marvelous, great in flight services and entertainment. I will recommend gulf air to my family and friends as well.

### "A330 was showing its age"
London to Islamabad via Bahrain. I have noticed many changes some positive and some negative. Positives being new plane from LHR to BAH with excellent comfort. However the meal service can be improved with quality of food, and drink service being served after I had finish my meal. I was travelling with kids so no goody bags given to kids this time plus seat selection prior to flight costs money. IFE lacked variety as very few options in Hollywood section. Flight from BAH to ISB was an old A330 with broken IFE and seats looked worn out. All in all I would fly again considering cheaper flight to Islamabad but Gulf Air needs to improve their service and probably introduce a better plane to ISB as A330 was showing its age.

### "I was not allowed to board"
I was not allowed to board the flight because the airline were not aware of the new Residency rules in Kuwait. Kuwait had a has a new system of not sticking a residency permit on your passport instead they have a smart card with all the relevant details. The new system was implemented on the 10th and I travelled on the 19th March. The airline did not have the new system in place. So I booked another flight and boarded without any problem. The worst part is that they don't respond to emails or complains. I was informed by one of the Gulf air staff that I would be contacted as quickly as possible . I am still waiting for that call. They take you seriously only if you are a GCC citizen else they just treat you like garbage.

### "Overbooked flight"
Overbooked flight, gate closed early your then promised to be put on another flight at no extra cost and then the staff are never to be seen again leaving you wondering around. Lost baggage, you make calls no answer, then told to contact after a certain amount of days, then told your bag has been found they will post it to you (lie). You then travel on your way back to collect your belongings and you'll be asked to pay a storage fee. Storage fee? For the bag that was lost by the airline and not yourself what a joke! When you try and claim this money back like I'm doing you don't get far with this airline. Gate closed 30mins early due to a overbooked flight... So they say you should never agree to another flight they offer you for you to be eligible for compensation but no one really wants to wait around only to be ignored by miserable rude staff. I booked gulf air and saved let's say £150 compared to a well known airlines but then had to pay £30 for storage fee to get my own stuff back and then £250 for another flight back due to being over booked not to mention gate closing early without any announcements. Lesson learnt never book with gulf air.

### "staff not engaged, not friendly"
Bahrain to London return. Boeing 787 outbound in Economy class and return in Business. Overall a mixed bag - The aircraft are brand new, in mint condition -  decent space in Economy and the Business class cabin makes for a lot of privacy. Hard product is above their gulf competition in my view. Y class food and drinks were tasty and generous and the crew were engaging and helpful. Only real down size is that if you were to fly regularly the entertainment content is very limited by Thales. I am giving a 5 on this as my return was a cash upgrade to business class - this was in my view a waste of money - staff were not engaged - service was very very sloppy. Service commenced with one drink after take off then nothing for 2.5 hours - no refill , no checks. Food was much better in economy - starter appeared, no wine, no bread - waited and waited, nothing gave up. Bread and wine appeared well after Starter finished. Crew did not know which wines were which -  beef main course was the worst I have ever had any where. Rock hard, inedible - sent it back to be told nothing else available - Business class? Then offered a kebab from economy, dessert service was a plated slice of cheese.- Overall Gulf Air business needs to get their premium soft product service in place - staff not engaged, not friendly, quality and service very poor - messy/sloppy. Economy was much better.

### "new 787 was clean and fresh"
London to Dubai via Bahrain. The new 787 was clean and fresh with good seat pitch. Plenty of overhead baggage space available. A basic amenity kit was a nice touch. The food was good and tasty however there was no water on the meal tray. several passengers were requesting water from the crew prior and during the meal service. The drinks cart passed through the cabin as a separate service after all the meals had been distributed and not accompanying the meal carts. By this time we were already a couple of hours into night flight that departed at 22.00 and people were gasping for fluids. A sweet apple pastry was served prior to landing with accompanying drinks service. Empty cups or garbage was not collected before landing and I noticed passengers still holding empty cups. The 1 hour connecting flight on a tired & aged A320 was comfortable & uneventful. A snack was served with juice. The same on the return Dubai - Bahrain sector. The return London 787 flight was slightly delayed. As the aircraft turned onto the runway a passenger stood up in the aisle looking for the toilet. He was sat a few rows in front/view of crew member with her eyes closed so unaware a passenger was out of their seat. I shouted across the cabin requesting he to sit down which he did. The main cabin lights were dimmed however the mid Galley lights were fully on potentially impeding the visual orientation of the passengers and crew sat at doors. I raised these issues with the crew after take off. During the night i walked to the mid galley to obtain a drink and had to ask the crew member sat on a box several times as she was asleep. She woke but didn't move - instead pointed to orange juice and told me to help myself. A full tasty breakfast was served prior to landing. During landing i noticed several window blinds were still down. My expectations of Gulf air were not met. The crew were generally helpful and provided a reasonable mediocre service, but didn't go out of their way, and in a couple of instances failed in both service and safety procedures.

### "flight was cancelled"
Alexandria to Dubai via Bahrain. It is so frustrating when you go to the airport, and then discover that the flight from Alexandria was cancelled? Without neither your agent or airline to notify you in advance!I sincerely never recommend Gulf Air.

### "standards are dropping"
Dammam to Karachi via Bahrain. Ever since Gulf Air has used Almasariya Universal Airlines to operate some routes, their service standards are dropping drastically. First of all cabin crew hardly speaks any language other than Arabic which I've noticed makes it very hard for Umrah Passengers to communicate. There's no IFE on these aircraft. If Gulf Air is planning to keep renewing the lease, at least they must equip aircraft with IFE. Their ground staff is professional but their efforts to keep passenger's journey stress free go in vain because of aircraft conditions. Since I prefer to fly with Gulf Air, if they happen to see the review, I hope they'll take necessary measures to overcome these issues.

### "no special meal option for me"
Flew from London to Abu Dhabi via Bahrain on their Boeing 787 and then A320. Had requested a special meal. First meal ( dinner) was fine although service is slow to non-existent e.g. didn't get my drink until after I had finished my meal. The worst was when they served a light breakfast before landing, I was told there is no special meal option for me and my wife despite having requested it almost a week prior. Seems Gulf Air us not reliable for dietary requirements so suggest either bringing your own food onboard or better yet fly with another airline - plenty to pick from. On the plus side the new air craft is comfortable enough. IFE movie selection is one of the most limited I've seen in a long time. This is the first time I flew with Gulf Air, would I use them again? No. I'd pay the £30-50 extra to use one of the other neighbouring country carriers.

### "friendly above expectations"
It is my pleasure to write for the cabin crew of flight GF-153 who made mine and few of my friends journey from Bangkok to Bahrain one of the most memorable 7.40 hours in air time. They have been friendly above our expectations. I have been travelling to places quite often and based on my experiences it really impress me to say that I was satisfied beyond.

### "he refused to board"
Moscow to Dammam via Bahrain. Very disappointed. At connection airport while boarding i had a boarding pass, but was not allowed to pass to the aircraft as Gulf Air manager dropped passengers out from the flight thinking that connection flight would be delayed. But it was in time. I had even boarding pass, but airport personnel called Gulf Air manager and he refused to board. When i approached Gulf Air manager he told me that flight is boarded already, and that he was not aware of call from departure gate when it was opened and i was there. Now i will fly night time with flight which is 5 hours later.

### "recommend this airline"
London to Dubai via Bahrain. The first time I've flown with this airline and was really impressed. The first leg from London to Bahrain was on their new B787-9 planes which were really clean and fresh, and you can immediately see the size of the thing. Add to that, the comfort, features and cabin pressure made the flight a much more enjoyable experience so top marks for that. The service onboard was fantastic with the crew assisting in every way possible, got a good location seating wise since there was 4 of us. The only downside is their planes have a 3 by 3 by 3 layout which means if you are a family or 4-6, you'll be sitting in the next row with a gap (I think most planes have at least 4 in one row) but this is a new plane so can't complain. Check-in from LHR was prompt including take-off and landing on time. The plane landed at Bahrain so smoothly you wouldn't even notice! Legroom was exceptional for the economy cabin as was the storage in the lockers and the seat pitch. The amenity kit was provided also which added to the comfort. The final leg of my journey from Bahrain to Dubai was on the older A320-200. Although these are old, I found them to be comfortable and for a journey which was only 1 hour it did the job perfectly. Legroom was fantastic, the seat pitch was great. Food and drinks were served promptly on both legs of the journey. For the short-haul flights, you are transported via bus to the plane at BAH, from the old terminal rather than using the sky bridges as the planes are also parked far away. On the way back, there was double security checking at Bahrain airport which I found weird, and this was just before we commenced boarding but nothing that detracted from the overall experience. I’ve not used the airline before, since my main route used to be with Qatar flying via Doha but since that route has been closed, Gulf is a viable option. In-flight entertainment is excellent on the 10” touch screens to keep you entertained, the map system is also very nice using a system by Thales. Overall, I would recommend this airline, and will definitely fly in the future.

### "friendly cabin crew"
Bahrain to Dubai. Nice and very good flight, friendly cabin crew, nice cabin and good seats, the meal was very delicious, the welcoming drinks and dates and arabic coffee were very good.

### "credit when it is due"
Not Verified |  Bahrain to Abu Dhabi. I like to give credit when it is due, it is not often that we see positives about experiences when flying especially in Y class. This was a redemption ticket with miles as I am gold with Gulf Air. Painless booking. Check in very smooth, through fast track immigration as always in seconds and the lounge had its usual decent food and bev. I have always found Gulf Air crew to be their best asset, they are always upbeat, and have that can do attitude. One passenger across from me looked very nervous and the crew were great in supporting her and keeping her assured. Service perfectly for this hop, with a second drink delivered with of course attitude. Kudos to Gulf Air, better flight crews and on board service on short hops that EK or EY and I am gold with both. Where Gulf Air need to improve is their entertainment systems which lack any real content.

### "service was absolutely superb"
London to Bangkok via Bahrain. Everything about the flights was excellent but in particular the cabin service was absolutely superb. Quick and efficient check in and boarding. Great food with very comfortable and spacious seat / bed. Easily the best airline I have used.

### "new kind of baggage policies"
Worst airline ever, they have some new kind of baggage policies. Only one bag at 23kg, is that make sense? Flight is late, food is disgusting for me. They should not have entertainment system, as anything you play, they keep on announcing unnecessary stuff. Airfares are extremely expensive .

### "food definitely not good"
Manila to Istanbul via Bahrain. Gulf Air appears to have decided to use its new 787 for the MNL-BHR (GF155) route, and the Apex seats in the business cabin were quite good. It turned out that this was the only thing positive about the flight, however. The FAs seemed nice enough but were not as attentive as one would expect. The food was definitely not good - it's like they just served really bad economy class food on linen and plates. IFE selection was also very limited. I’ve seen YouTube videos of Gulf Air business class passengers on the airline’s new 787s having a wonderful time, being given pajamas, being attended to by a “sky chef,” being spoiled by the FAs, enjoying delicious food, choosing desserts from a cart. These things will not happen on this route - you will experience a general sense of apathy, you will have to endure being ignored by a generally invisible crew, and you will get hungry enough to wish you had stashed a burger in your carry-on bag. The second leg of the journey, BHR-IST, was a bit better simply because I had by this time thrown all expectations out the window and was just waiting to arrive at our destination. The experience was again more or less the same on our inbound flights (GF44 & 154), but this time around one of the male FAs took the effort to put on a “sky chef” uniform and later wheeled in a cart with a few dessert choices. I did not go hungry this time because I had the foresight to bring some food with me on this flight (just like I used to do on economy class trans-pacific flights to the US in the early 2000s). In short, Gulf Air provided a nice business class seat but not much else, at least for flights to and from Manila.

### "not recommend this airline"
London to Lahore via Bahrain. Flight from Heathrow to Bahrain was very uncomfortable because the the seats were small, think twice before buying their ticket because its a 6 hour flight. Though the plane was new but it was a space-conserving plane (Boeing 787-9). Staff was rude to me, food and entertainment rubbish for me. Flight from Bahrain to Lahore was even worse the staff attitude didn't match a professional attitude. Bahrain airport return flight used transfer busses. All in all I will not recommend this airline for long flights.

### "left my baggage at Bahrain"
London to Multan via Bahrain. Firstly at Heathrow they were unable to retrieve my booking from Bahrain to Multan. Took them half an hour to retrieve my entire booking. I was travelling on business class from Bahrain to Multan. Guess what? They left my baggage at Bahrain even travelling on business class. Got my bag after 2 days. Never going to travel with them again.

### "not travelling for free"
Bahrain to Dhaka. This was my first time with Gulf Air. The condition of the airplane was below standard. Specially the air hostess were annoying, they were inadequate in number and behaving rough with the passengers. I understand that many of the passengers were poor/ labour Bangladeshi but they were not travelling for free. So they got the right too. All the passenger were unable to speak English, so they couldn't argue.

### "offer a good service"
London to Dubai via Bahrain. Gulf Air offer a good service particularly to and from Heathrow where 787's are used. Using T4 is also an advantage as the terminal appears less hectic than the others. I didn't try the IFE but the food and general service was attentive without being overpowering. Food was good but not exceptional with several dishes being repeated on the outbound and inbound legs. An amenity bag was provided in both directions even though the flights were in daylight. The absence of wifi appears strange on such new planes. The short (60 minute) leg to/from Dubai used a wide bodied A330 one way and a A320 the other. Both aircraft were travel worn but the cabin was almost empty with the same attentive service. Gulf Air offer a significantly lower cost option than direct flights to Dubai. I will use them again. Would be 9/10 with in flight wifi.

### "good value for money"
London to Chennai via Bahrain. I had booked this flights as there were almost 100 pounds cheaper as I had to travel in the next couple of days of booking. I have very little or no expectations as my previous experience with Gulf Air five years ago was worst. Boarding the flight from London to Bahrain it was a new aircraft. In flight entertainment was not the best but I can find something to keep me going for the 6 hours. Could not complain about the food and drinks on offer. As always no matter who the carrier is the connecting flight to Chennai was old, not so clean and poor service I think almost all middle east airlines feel they are running Indian routes for charity forgetting Indians are their majority customers. Overall I feel choosing this carrier is a good value for money.

### "baggage are left at Bahrain"
Riyadh to Bahrain via Hyderabad. Cabin crew service was not good, I was travelling to Hyderabad from Riyadh Via Bahrain.Firstly flight was delayed for around 3.5 hours at Bahrain, and when we visited Hyderabad and waiting for baggage, they informed that the baggage are left at Bahrain. Then ask us to fill the missed baggage form and stamp from customs etc. Then they informed us that they will receive the baggage by next Gulf air flight to Hyderabad and will be delivered to home in 24 hours. I received the baggage after 1 week after calling them continuously, and the condition of the baggage was worst out of shaped and items were damaged.

### "star of the flight was the food"
Bahrain to Jeddah. This flight was smooth from the check in process all the way to the boarding. There were too many pilgrims aboard and some of them were not able to speak English and one passenger refused to take a seat away from his wife and wanted to speak with the flight attendant while the plane was in taxi stage. The flight attendant was infuriated and literally said “oh my god” and took him to his seat. I really can’t blame her he was too much. The real star of the flight was the food which was chicken kabsah and it tasted like a quality restaurant was serving it.

### "food wasn't as expected"
Bahrain to Casablanca. Going direct was my main concern, that's why I paid around 600 Bahraini Dinars. Everything was ok, clean and new aircraft, seat was ok but we cannot choose the seat online from Casablanca, cabin crew were nice, helpful, but the food wasn't as expected. Really bad choice and should change the service asap. For the way back, it was worse. The choice and quality for lunch was poor. The service from Casablanca was the greatest before, as I travelled on Gf 081 and 083 long time back . The food is not that much important for me more that the comfort of the flight itself , but i still have to talk about it as it s a long-haul flight and needs to have a look at it.

### "A really bad service"
Riyadh to Athens via Bahrain. The worst airline I've flown. We recently took a flight with our three children from Riyadh to Athens via Bahrain with Gulf Air. The cabin service was pretty unfriendly and just about functional but we didn't have great expectations of Gulf Air - I know they aren't in the same league as Emirates or Qatar. Upon arrival in Athens we experienced that moment every traveller dreads when the baggage carousel finishes spewing out bags, all the other passengers have gone and you are left holding just your hand luggage. We reported it to the Handling Agent in Athens who told us there was another flight arriving that night but for some reason ours couldn't be located and if it was we wouldn't get it for at least another 48 hours. Deep joy. The started of your holiday with three small children and only the clothes you are wearing and a book and half eaten sandwich for company. We then spent the next three days phoning, emailing and tweeting the airline. All to no avail. No response other than a huge phone bill with hours spent waiting on hold. Eventually our bags were delivered 4 days late to a local island but they were damaged and showing signs of mistreatment. Again - no response, apology or communication or any form from the airline. The return journey back to Riyadh was slightly less miserable and we took the opportunity speak to the airline offices in Athens and Bahrain about compensation. No surprises though when the airline said they couldn't / wouldn't help whatsoever - even complimentary lounge access for our 3 children during the 4 hour layover in Bahrain was flatly refused. In all - it's down to customer service or a total lack of, disregard and disdain for their customers and a haphazard operation. I had a similar experience with Emirates in January and by contrast they couldn't have been more helpful. No questions compensation of $250, limo from the airport and they picked up the tab for essential items that I bought whilst they located my bags. Poor show Gulf Air. A really bad service.

### "good food and hospitality"
Bahrain to Moscow. Old airplane and IFE is bit limited. No USB. A good quality seat, good food and hospitality from the flight attendants. A reasonable price from Bahrain to Moscow

### "friendly and attentive crew"
Bahrain to London Heathrow. Boarding the plane in Bahrain was a bit hectic, they had asked people to line up for boarding but boarding didn’t start until 20 minutes later, considering the fact that this was the early morning flight (around 1am) this was more of an inconvenience than seemed as people were tired. Once on the plane, the seat and entertainment system were sleek, modern, practical and functional. Soon after take off the cabin crew passed around distributing either chicken or vegetarian sandwiches, I chose the chicken, which was quite delicous. Drinks were also served, a selection of juices, coffee, tea, water and soft drinks were available. The inflight entertainment was not huge, but it was satisfactory, with a selection of different genres of movies, TV shows, games and music. The amenities that were given weren’t a lot, but it was enough (socks, eyeshades and earplugs). Aside from the visual beauty of the seat, the reclining capability was not limited and was very comfortable to sleep on, also the adjustable headrest and the soft pillow and blanket added to the comfort. I woke up for breakfast which they served about an hour to an hour and a half before landing, the non-vegetarian option included a main meal consisting of an omelette, a sausage patty, some potatoes and mushrooms in a tomato sauce, separately it wasn’t appetizing but together they complimented each other well. It wasn’t overly amazing, but it was nice. Aside from that, some yoghurt, fresh fruit, a croissant with condiments and a cup of orange juice was served, flight attendants also came around to serve drinks. After landing in London, it took us some time to get to our gate, due to traffic and malfunctioning air bridge but that wasn’t Gulf Air’s fault. Overall, the best part of the flight would be the aesthetically pleasing design, the friendly and attentive cabin crew and the comfortable seat.

### "I was really satisfied"
Frankfurt to Bangkok via Bahrain in Business Class was quite nice. This was my first time to use Gulf Air at Frankfurt airport. So, I did not realized before that the airline lounge was located outside the passenger security control. After passing immigration and security control and coming inside, I was looking for the lounge and then I noticed that there was no lounge inside here. Gulf Air use Cathay Pacific Lounge, located before security control. Frankfurt to Bahrain used A320 aircraft which it is quite small aircraft but business class seat is very comfortable. I got a welcome drink, which was a lemon mint. Sky chef came out to suggest the menu, I chose grilled seabass with lime rice and dessert was German cheese cake and fresh fruit. The meal service was very nice and I was offered white wine too. Flight hours from Frankfurt to Bahrain is about 5 hours. So, only one meal service was served -  I did expect to have hot tea or coffee with some small snack before landing. When arrived to Bahrain airport, passing through quick security control at transit area, I went directly to the business class Lounge. Staff in lounge attentive. Bahrain to Bangkok the seat is very nice and large space. Welcome drink offered, I chose fusion appetizers as starter and main course was honey duck. I did enjoy Gulf Air business class meal very much. After meal service, flight attendant came out to ask if I wanted my seat to be prepared as bed. Then they adjust my seat to be a bed with mattress and bed sheet. Their in-flight entertainment is nice, a lot of movies and musics, also games and information. About 1.50 hours before landing, flight attendant woke me up for breakfast which I was offered for fresh fruit, croissant, hot tea and juice. I was really satisfied for Gulf Air business class class.

### "definitely fly with them again"
Bangkok to Frankfurt via Bahrain was a really pleasant experience. I got a very warm greeting from the flight attendant when entering the aircraft and selection of welcome drink, I choose champagne. The Sky Chef came out to offer the lunch menu and drink. I choose Cod fish and Italian dry white wine, which was very good. I have to say that the meal was beyond my expectation. Flight attendant was very attentive, often came to fill up my wine and very nice personality, asking me if I did enjoy the flight or not. When arrived to Bahrain, I used the Falcon Gold lounge waiting for my next flight to Frankfurt. The lounge is large, choices of meals and drinks. Meal in the lounge taste quite good. I took beef stew and deep fried chicken. Drinks, a lot of choice from juice to beer, wine and champagne too. Again flight from Bahrain to Frankfurt. They use smaller aircraft (A320) but seat is comfortable and large space. Since it was a late night flight. So, I was serve only light meal and choose Garden Salad and drink champagne. I think that it was nice salad and meal was not too much for late night flight. Breakfast was served 1 hour before landing. I choose omelet and hot coffee. Seat on Falcon Gold is very nice and comfortable. I have looked for my next trip to Frankfurt in November and I see that Gulf Air will change aircraft from A330 to B787 which B787 has new modern seat configuration too. Base on some negative review of Gulf Air which I read before, first, made me quite unsure about to fly with them but I would definitely fly with them again.

### "jump in the right direction"
London to Bahrain. I'm a regular on the LHR-BAH route but this was the first time on the 787. A huge improvement generally compared to the A330, and that certainly wasn't bad. It's very quiet and smooth, and the new staff uniform is very smart. The seat is excellent and all-aisle access is a good move. The handheld IFE controller is a down point though,  not very intuitive how to use it. In fact, IFE generally is a miss... the screen is massive and high quality, but the film and TV selection is small, and seems to just be lifted from the A330, a big miss to upgrade this. Gulf Air food is normally very good but on this flight it wasn't great, with a dry prawn salad and a massively overcooked beef dish. However, I think this is a one off that I can forgive based on history. Little things matter, so for the first time I've seen on a GF flight, they handed out landing cards whilst en route - just made arriving a bit simpler. So overall, a big jump in the right direction, but don't waste the excellent IFE screen with poor content.

### "Nothing to complain about"
An okay experience overall, London to Bahrain, then to Islamabad, IFE was very limited and a little outdated, the connecting flight to Pakistan had no IFE. The meals were hot on both the outgoing and return flights, cabin crew were attentive, Nothing to complain about, nothing to overly praise either, I am not sure if they are competing with the other Arab region airlines, if they are, Gulf Air still have a little way to go.

### "the fare was 80% less"
Not Verified |  I think I have flown with Gulf Air on and off for 36 years and they have had some highs and lows but I have stuck with them as service levels have been good and in premium class have always tried very hard. They now have a game changer in the shape of the Boeing 787 twice daily to London. I chose them over a UAE direct route as in the busy summer period the fare was 80% less though still considerable. Decent lounge in Bahrain, short flight in from DXB good breakfast served. London leg in the new 787 is fantastic, champagne good on the ground lounge at LHR T4 very calm and civilised. The new seat is well contained but with aisle access, gracious cabin crew, wonderful Sky chef both ways and the crew worked non stop with about 2o pax both ways. Food is served individually, delicious desserts trolley served, afternoon tea round 2, on time. AVOD is only about 60 movies, also wine lists had not been printed. Aircraft is only a month old and comfortable.

### "rude and insolent"
London to Dubai via Bahrain. The first leg of the outward journey was fine - we boarded and departed from Heathrow on time and the crew were professional and efficient. Then we got to Bahrain and quality went out of the window. The Gulf Air ground crew were rude and insolent. Then the flight crew didn't bother to turn up on time and the flight to Dubai was delayed - no word of explanation or apology. The flight attendants seemed unable to communicate verbally. I am now on the return part of my journey and sitting in Dubai airport where (surprise surprise!) the flight to Bahrain has been delayed by 1.5 hours- once again with no explanation. I will undoubtedly miss my connecting flight back to Heathrow. Gulf Air? Never again!

### "good food and service"
Not Verified |  Paris to Bangkok via Bahrain. Good value, good food and service, comfortable seat but not fully flat. Airplanes on time, comfortable lounges. I recommend. FR: Bon rapport qualité/prix, nourriture et service correct, siège confortable mais pas totalement à l'horizontal. Avions à l'heure, salons confortables. RAS, je recommande .

### "There was no apology from Gulf"
I flew from London to Islamabad (via Bahrain) with Gulf Air on 11 June. I checked-in two bags in London. Only one bag arrived in Islamabad. The missing bag arrived one week later! There was no apology from Gulf or explanation why it had taken a week for my bag to arrive. Customer services were poor. My advice would be not to travel with Gulf. There are plenty of other, better airlines operating in the region with more convenient routes and flight times.

### "good routes and timings"
London to Bahrain. I fly Gulf Air regularly to the UK and around the gulf region so this airlines suits me fine with good routes and timings. I've found them punctual nearly all the time. The service on the ground and on board is acceptable. This was interesting for me because the return was on one of their brand new Dreamliner planes (3-3-3 economy configuration) and it was pretty comfortable. I was lucky as the plane wasn't completely full. The armrests lift up fully and so following meal service I was able to get some sleep across the three seats. Perfect.

### "they accused me of lying"
London to Dubai via Bahrain. I flew with my family and my wife’s chair didn’t work, I complained on the flight and they then moved my wife and daughter some rows behind us, this was done by moving a single passenger to the seat that was working. On the way back my wife’s chair didn’t recline and again the same nonsense! Not to mention that Gulf cancelled my connecting flight from Dubai to Bahrain but chose not to rebook it. I found this out when I then tried to call and double check all my details. I made a formal complaint to Gulf air who took 2 months to respond, they accused me of lying. They are the poorest airline I have ever flown with.

### "was a great experience"
Athens to Mumbai via Bahrain. It was a great experience particularly while travelling from Bahrain to Mumbai. I was very happy  with the hospitality of one of the hostesses, she was so helpful and courteous.

### "won’t honor seat assignment"
Abu Dhabi to London via Bahrain. They won’t honor your seat assignment even when you go to the trouble of checking in online and have a confirmation (my seat was 12D, but during the boarding process they changed it to row 28 - the last one in the plane!). On my outbound flight they lost my luggage and  couldn’t print my boarding pass for the second leg of the trip causing me to stand in line for over 30 minutes at the Transfer Desk in Bahrain to get it printed and almost missed my connection.

### "seats look old but clean"
Flight from Kuwait to Bahrain was full (04/18/2018). The plane seats look old but clean. The movies on their IFE were a little old and neither do they provide headsets. Cabin temperature was mild to hot all throughout the flight. One of the staff was rude.

### "thoroughly enjoyed my flight"
Bahrain to Bangkok. Business class seating was 2x2x2 layout, with  76 inch pitch and flat bed. Boarding was smooth, and I was offered pre flight drinks, including champagne. I opted for my favourite lemon and mint soft drink. Amenity Kit was tucked into the side of my seat. Then followed the  towel. The seat was extremely comfortable, although I found manipulating the controls little difficult. The announcements were also unclear. Pre-dinner drinks were on offer, although no wine list or drinks menu was offered on the outbound leg. The onboard 'chef' asked me what my choice of drinks would be, and deliberately knowing they would not have it, I asked for a Manhattan. He was so apologetic, but we laughed about it, and settled for a tripple Chevas on the rocks. He took my order a for Middle Eastern selection of starters, including humus and delicious concoctions. That was followed by a grilled steak that was so tender and tasty. The desert and cheese trolley followed soon after. The IFE as usual, is very limited, boring and the controls difficult to operate. The noise-cancelling headphones weren't any better, and kept crackling and I tried to watch a movie I had seen before, but had fallen asleep anyway, And hour and a half before landing, breakfast was served, I was too full and settled for just a croissant and coffee. On my return, I was served with a wine list and the onboard chef addressed me by name and even posed for some photos. The food was excellent, with very quick and friendly service from the flight attendants. Gulf Air in my view deserves to be upgraded to 4 stars, at least in Business Class. I thoroughly enjoyed my flight, and have no hesitation of flying with them again. But please Gulf Air, can you do something about your IFE?

### "good service and great food"
London Heathrow to Bahrain. Having flown economy before and rather disappointed, I was hoping for a much better experience flying Falcon Gold (Business Class) with them. Check in at Heathrow Terminal 4 was efficient and quick. Gulf Air usually use A330's on their long haul sectors, but for some reason deploy a narrow body for this one mid week flight. The 2x2 layout for the A320ER was as expected. But what surprised me was the seat pitch of around 76 inches, three clear windows width, and partition for privacy, which was the same as wide body aircraft. On boarding I was offered a hot towel and a welcome drink, including sparkling wine. The amenity kit was OK without being luxurious. We took off on time, and I settled down in my seat which was very comfortable and big. Then came the on board 'chef' (like on Turkish Airlines), taking my request for lunch. Pre lunch drinks were served, with top ups, followed by an excellent meal. Their signature dish of tender Lamb Shank was oh so delicious, followed by a sweet and cheese trolley. My only disappointment was the IFE, with a very limited selection of movies and shows. I opted to read my book and nodded off for a short nap instead. An hour before landing, we were served with a snack. Arriving in Bahrain usually meets with hectic queues. No Fast Track was offered. But I was pleasantly surprised to be second in the queue at passport control. From disembarking, to meeting my contact at arrivals in a mere 15 minutes! It was a faultless flight (with the exception of IFE), with good service and great food. I am looking forward to my next leg on a A330.

### "recommend never using Gulf"
Colombo to London via Bahrain. I had a really appalling experience with Gulf Air. Having had a text confirmation of the flight, it was then delayed 4 hours (with no text informing me of this, which would have saved me going to the airport). Upon returning to the airport at 1100pm on New Year's eve, I was told the flight was cancelled. There was no business Check in, so wth two kids I had to wait in a long queue of irate passengers. They were massively under-staffed, and were unable to find me any alternative flight to London, so I booked my own - on Qatar Airways (a great airline) - it took my a whole 3 minutes to find this flight, but Gulf air were unable to do anything! Despite writing three times to Gulf, including one email to the mis-titled, 'director of communications', I had no apology or indeed any reply whatsoever from them. Eventually through my on line travel agency I got a note saying that I would be reimbursed for my flight within 30 Days. It is all a bit of a joke, my last minute tickets on Qatar Airways cost me an additional £3,000. So if this is how they treat their Business Class customers, imagine what it's like in Economy. I seriously recommend never using Gulf - there is a massive Gulf between what they promise and what they deliver!

### "Huge regret on my part"
Lahore to London via Bahrain in April 2017. Lahore airport  busy and bustling. Ground staff for check in were OK but made some very questionable decisions regarding the queuing which meant I had to wait an extra 15-20 minutes. Checked into the lounge for a few hours' sleep only to realise that the flight had been delayed by three hours, which really worried me seeing as I had a 3 hour layover in Bahrain. But, waited out and then after another delay (there was no explanation by the way) boarded an old A320 with poorly maintained seats, broken IFE and an absolute skirmish for seats. Taking the seat on your boarding pass? Forget about it. I'm glad I actually got a seat if I'm honest. Breakfast was positively repulsive judging by what my brother got so I skipped on it. Cabin crew were curt and disrespectful. Got to Bahrain and my connection to London had been delayed by 8 hours, giving me 5 hours in Bahrain airport. Went to try and talk to someone at a counter about the status of the next flight and all I got was an earful of shouts and insults. McDonalds in Bahrain is pretty cheap and is fairly low on the Big Mac index. Heathrow flight was OK – pretty empty, crew was pleasant and food not as terrible. IFE semi worked. Plane was still very old and the seat was pretty uncomfortable. I bought these tickets as they were cheap via a travel agent. The extra £100 to fly with Qatar Airways would have been so worth it. Huge regret on my part.

### "nice and helpful experience"
London to Multan via Bahrain. I booked a ticket for my wife and my 3 weeks old son through Gulf air, after booking I have called customer services two times, it was nice and helpful experience to talk to customer services, and agent was polite. My wife said the staff was really helpful and made her trip really easy as she was travelling alone with 3 weeks old son, the crew was outstanding. While dropping my wife and son in the airport, the supervisor lady for checking in heathrow terminal 4 warmly welcomed us and she has given us priority check-in due to 3 weeks baby with us. Apart from this, my wife had a good support in Bahrain airport as well (the staff at Bahrain airport was good and supportive too).

### "recommend never to fly with them"
Myself and friends flew Gulfair to Colchin in Kerala for a nice January break. Unfortunately the holiday didn't get off to a good start as we had a 3hour delay in Heathrow with no warning and this was followed by a 8.5hour delay in Bahrain. We were not provided with any accommodation, food or water. We missed a pre packed hotel night in our final destination. I have contacted the company on multiple occasions but you are unable to speak to their customer care department directly and even though they promise someone will call you back no one does. I would recommend never to fly with them! !

### "really disappointed"
London to Bahrain. Really disappointed firstly went to check in lugguge the staff were really rude. Inflight the service was bad. My flight was at 9.30 am and we had our lunch after 2pm, no Breakfast just a glass of orange juice and only one kind of juice. Avoid this airline. Really disappointed.

### "treated like criminals"
I was checked in on the full journey Mumbai to Paris via Bahrain on 18th Jan. After waiting hours for the transfer, we started boarding the plane after a delay. We were bussed out to the aircraft. The flight was not full, I had a full row to myself. Basically the issues started from then. 1 gentleman was offloaded from the flight, then they were calling my name, I too was offloaded from the flight and finally a 3rd gentleman. without reason or explanation. We were treated like criminals. We were bussed back to the terminal with an excuse that there is a technical issue with the aircraft? (Why offload 3 PAX from a not full flight) Dropped at the transfer desk, I have never been treated so appallingly by two obnoxious people in all my life! We were given an option of flying straight to Dubai then onto Frankfurt (had to make our own way to Paris) Or take the same flight on the 19th Jan. Now blocked at passport control! Even though we had the 'vouchers' from Gulf - they wouldn't let us enter Bahrain. After hours of back and forth we arrived at a hotel at 5am. Flight 19th Jan - 11pm I tried to speak to the customer services at check in - they had no interest in helping me find an address to make a claim. Only to be told the flight was now leaving early to fly via Cairo and arriving 2 hours late. My seat was 24C last row aisle, upon boarding I was told it wasn't available and to take any other seat. It also seemed they had told people to take any seat. It was pandemonium. After being more that 24 hours delayed I have missed all my train connections (had to by a new ticket). I can safely say I will never ever use Gulf Air.

### "never fly Gulf Air again"
Bangkok to Kuwait via Bahrain. I will never fly Gulf Air again. Pity. Convenient service, very favourable price, on-board customer service always excellent. Total contrast to the ground staff. New Year’s Eve 2017/18. Diverted flight to DXB instead of BAH, then from DXB to BAH and then from BAH to KWI. Worst customer experience I and others who spoke with have ever had. GA turned a minor problem (fog, inevitable delays) into 24 hour nightmare - no doubt longer for some customers less lucky than me. At DXB for about 11 hours. No update issued the entire time. But that experience was mild compared to when we arrived at BAH. Staff totally unresponsive to and contemptuous of their customers, who had serious and legitimate needs, questions. Instead of trying to help, GA staff seemed to take pleasure in making customers’ waiting experience as painful and lengthy as possible. After I lined up for over 6 hours near Gate 13, some staff manning the cues suddenly walked off. Promised to return but never did. One senior GA staff member angrily yelled at the crowd that it was their fault that they were waiting so long because they could not cue in 1 line. He told remaining staff to leave. No reason given. Eventually no one left to serve the customers. Told to go to the transfer area to be served. Went from terrible to much worse. About 15 customer cues, area totally crowded. After 2 hours, some staff again just left, didn’t return. So some cues had no staff. So cues soon turned into an unruly mob pushing and shoving, all pleading to be served. Instead of putting on more staff, GA operated understaffed, but not overworked! All staff at all times were visibly very calm, very relaxed, working very slowly, and also amused to be observing the pleas of the distressed crowd. They thought it was all a joke. There were up to 6 -8 other staff just monitoring the crowds from the front with a contemptuous smile. They could have helped out the lines that had no staff member, but didn’t bother to. Totally ignrored customer requests for assistance. One desperate elderly customer showed me his chest bandages and asked me to hand his passport details to the staff member. He was too weak to fight the pushing crowd. I was by this stage close to being served. I shamefully didn’t help the old man. I was fearful that handing another person’s documents could get me in trouble with the staff & delay the time I would be served. As it happened, as soon as I was given my new boarding pass, I was instructed to go immediately to the gate as they were departing. No baggage ref. number given to me. 5 minutes later and I would have missed that flight & not know when able to get another. It was survival of the fittest at this stage. The above situation was one that the management and ground staff created. They treated their customers like animals. Like a large herd of cattle. People were in distress. Responses to customer requests (if at all) with mindless answers like ‘just wait’ & bored smirk. I thought that the lack of oxygen, water & endless standing could cause me to pass out. I hung on because the alternative was worse – not knowing when I would leave BAH. The experience was so ugly that I refuse to use them again for moral & practical reasons. PS. don’t even have luggage back yet. Whether I get it back or not, so relieved to escape nightmare. Space limit precludes further details.

### "worst travel experience"
Dubai to London via Bahrain. The worst travel experience of our life. The outward got off to a bad start when we realised at Heathrow check in that our connecting flight In Bahrain for Dubai was impossible to make due to schedule changes - we had a real battle on our hands to get it changed by Gulf Air - they wanted us to sort it in Bahrain. So on leg 1, we had already lost 4 hours of our holiday. The staff were rude, plane was old and very dirty, particularly the toilets, absolutely vile. Bahrain airport is really third world. On our return journey,was even worse! Dubai Check in goes well. We wait in departure, we board and within 15 mins of being on board we are offloaded due to fog in Bahrain. We return to lounges and for the next 8 hours zero communication, terrible customer service in the first class lounge, we discover via the internet  that our flight is leaving at 7.10am. The board was never updated and apparently over 40 passengers were left behind in Dubai. We are told that our connection to London will depart at 10.10am. Arrive in Bahrain, with 90 mins to wait, and now things turn even worse. Our plane just doesn’t materialise. The staff are incredibly rude, arrogant and unhelpful. Passengers are so exhausted and frustrated, the atmosphere becomes militant and staff pull rank by threatening to call the police. In fact we were all diverted to a dead end desk area - which was just a ruse to make us feel something was happening. There was zero communication,a lot of disinterested shoulder shrugging. I can’t even be bothered to go into the exact lowdown on what transpired but eventually a plane arrives, and 3 hours later which in fact on top of Dubai delay is a grand total of 10.5 hour delay we take off.

### "Have largely positive things to say"
Have largely positive things to say from London Heathrow - Bahrain - Chennai return trip over Christmas. All flights were roughly on time and very comfortable overall. Seats on both legs were fine and it should be noted that the A321 has an extra inch or so of legroom and better padding over the A330. Service from FAs was fine, with most of them making an effort to fulfil passengers' requests, serving a meal and a small snack on both flights of decent quality- I found myself finishing them all so they must have been ok and the offering was different on all 4 flights so good variety. Selection of drinks was small, basically just offering 2 juices and 2 soft drinks (some of which ran out in flight). Seat back entertainment was only average - the screens themselves were good quality but selections of movies, tv shows and music was small (probably around 10 western films available). Bahrain airport is small though largely clean and easy to navigate, with a small number of dining options and a fair amount of seating (none of which enables you to lie down if you have a long layover) so it was fine overall, as long as you don't mind folk washing their feet in the sink in the toilets, which seemed common! We were fortunate in that both legs between Bahrain and Chennai were far from full so once boarding was complete we managed to grab a whole row of 3 seats each to ourselves, meaning we had plenty of space to lie down in flight, though it's worth noting that none of the armrests on the A321 raise fully so you have to push them up half way and contort your body to fit. My impression of Gulf was that they'll do the job mostly well, though with no frills at all and every so often cracks appearing in the quality e.g. tissue holders coming loose in bathrooms and FAs slow to replace empty loo rolls and most worryingly on 2 flights when passengers stood up as soon as we'd landed but still taxiing and they started opening luggage compartments and moving down the aisle, FAs did practically nothing to stop them! On arrival at Heathrow we taxied for approx 10 mins with 30-40 people standing in the aisles, luggage compartments open, the plane braking heavily several times and the FAs simply asked a couple of people very quietly to sit down, when they didn't, the response was to give up! I would fly with them again if the price were right again, my wife and I paid £440 &, £650 respectively for flights at slightly different times around Christmas and overall this saved us several hundred pounds over other airlines.

### "The food was excellent"
Flew Bangkok to Bahrain. Gulf Air uses the Miracle lounge at Bangkok Airport. Although shared with other airlines it was almost empty. Reasonable selection of food and drink although WiFi was sluggish. Boarding was disorganised with everyone crowding the exit door making it almost impossible to get through they called business. Why can’t airlines get this right? Business was half empty and although the seats were conventional 2-2-2 they did go flat. There was no shortage of cabin crew and my glass of champagne was constantly topped up. Although it wasn’t a new aircraft it was clean and well maintained and – with a little cajoling – my seat worked as it should. The food was excellent – a decent choice and tasty with a reasonable selection of wine and other drinks. The IFE took several attempts to boot but when it did there were no movies – only TV programmes. I wasn’t too bothered because I had a good book and some work. Cabin crew seemed aware of the lack of movies. We arrived 30 minutes early at Bahrain and a coach seamlessly took the business passengers to the terminal. There was no fast track for business transfer passengers and so we had to wait for vast numbers of Indian workers to remove their belts and jewellery. But even then it was considerable more efficient than Heathrow. Gulf Air is clearly not up to Emirates/Etihad/Qatar standards but the standard of service from the friendly and chatty cabin crew and the quality of the food more than makes up for the older aircraft.

### "I would fly Gulf Air again"
Dubai to London via Manama. Dubai to Bahrain was good and short in a young A320, ordinary as you would expect. They served a danish pastry and a drink. IFE was included but since its a short flight, you won't really have time to watch it except for a 30 minute TV show. We had a 2 hour layover in Bahrain. Dubai to London was also good, we boarded a 17-18 year old A330, but the cabin was in good condition. They gave us 1 meal, an option of chicken, beef or fish I think. IFE is included again in this  flight. We landed on time and overall I would fly Gulf Air again.

### "little that I could find fault with"
Bahrain to Bangkok. The business lounge at Bahrain is spacious and comfortable with fast Wi-Fi and numerous power points. Gulf Air has also added USB charging points adjacent to many of the tables. There was an excellent food selection and champagne at a self-service bar. Boarding was quick and efficient and the cabin crew were quick to help passengers with their bags in the half-empty business section. With advice from the on-board chef we made a food selection before taking off. There was an impressive choice and it was neatly served, very tasty and care was taken to ensure that glasses, in my case containing wine, were kept full. The seat was comfortable and the cabin, although very dry, was kept as an ideal temperature for a comfortable sleep. I opted not to receive breakfast but, from what I saw, it was equally satisfying. The cabin crew went out of their way to ensure that we were looked after and there was relatively little that I could find fault with the aircraft or the level of service. There were, perhaps, slightly too many announcements which made watching a film slightly annoying. There was a reasonable selection of films and the IFE worked seamlessly although some passengers seem slightly confused about the innovative control unit. The aircraft arrived at Bangkok Airport exactly on time and although the gate could perhaps have been slightly closer it was a quick exit and bags were arriving on the carousel is the first passengers exited immigration.

### "this flight could not be faulted"
London Heathrow to Bahrain. I have not flown with Gulf Air for several years but this flight could not be faulted – especially given the price and the not-so-modern seats. Check-in was faultless and quick. Heathrow ‘fast track’ was, for once, fast although that was probably because I was the only person passing through at that time. The Falcon lounge was perfect. Good view, easy wifi connection, power points, attentive staff, good selection of food and close to the gate. Boarding was quick and efficient with business passengers given priority. Although the seats were not flat-bed I actually prefer them for day flights – made even better because the business section was only one-thirds full. Champagne was offered on boarding and the glass was refiled. There was a delay of 30 minutes before we took off but we landed in BAH on time. There was a selection of wines including Petit Chablis: not sure why Gulf Air could not afford to spend a little extra and give of Chablis proper. Cabin crew were excellent – efficient, humorous and attentive. There was a good selection of food and drink and it was served perfectly. It was tasty and well presented. Breakfast consisted of a nice chicken salad and a delicious prawn curry. Cabin announcements were kept to a minimum which is always a relief. The selection of films was limited but more than sufficient. I managed to watch two recent films. Overall, there was nothing I could find wrong about this flight and would not hesitate to fly Gulf Air again.

### "not ready to help her in keeping luggage"
Frankfurt to Hyderabad via Bahrain. We booked this ticket for my mom who cannot speak English, flying from Dallas to Hyderabad via American Airlines. We requested for wheelchair assistance and we double confirmed before fly. American Airlines helped my mom well from Dallas. Once she landed in Frankfurt her hard time started. The wheel chair assistance people left her at wrong gate, none of the Gulf Air staff responded or helped by any means. She had to travel to other terminal by carrying her luggage. Almost the same situation at Bahrain Airport from Gulf staff. Another experience was air hostess were not ready to help her in keeping luggage. Now she is sick after reaching home.

### "treat frequent flyers with distaste"
Bahrain to Abu Dhabi in business class. I'm at the point of thinking Gulf Air wish to treat their loyal business class frequent flyers with distaste. No fast track as the security guy wants to go on break. Made to queue for 45 minutes at main security. Again bus to the aircraft with no business class bus, stuck on the bus for 20 minutes with 30 screaming school kids and this all before you even get to the aircraft. Two weeks ago business London to Bahrain they lost my bag, called the following  day to see where it was and told it had arrived but as they had lost my passport copy they can't deliver it. I had to go and pick it up. Two emails to customer care no reply. Duty manager at airport said "not his problem ". I'm done Gulf Air, no wonder your losing money hand over fist .

### "The food was delicious"
London to Bangkok via Bahrain. Checking at LHR was quick and painless. The Falcon Gold lounge at LHR is really good and worth a visit although it can be crowded when there is a full business class. Boarding was quick and gate staff ensured that business class and families with small children could board first. The cabin crew gave a warm greeting at the door and pointed us to our seat where bottled water and aminty kits were waiting. Welcome drinks were served and the onboard chef came round to take meal orders. The seat is very comfortable and much better than say BA's but it has been a few years since GF introduced their current cabin and it is starting to show it age so while everything works the cabin is screaming for a refurbishment. The crew were a delight on this trip. We hit a spot of medium turbulence and a lady were struggling to cope but the cabin crew took turns to sit with her and reassure her for the 15 minutes or so the turbulence lasted. The food was delicius, possibly some of the best in the air and it can easily compete with Turkish and Qatar. The IFE is fairly simple and along with the cabin could benefit from attention. The stop over in BAH was made comfortable by the Falcon Gold lounge which provides great food and drink and showers if needed. The second leg to BKK was as comfortable as the first with great food and a delightful cabin crew. Again everything worked but the cabin was showing its age. That should not, however, take away the fact that GF is offering a solid business class product with one of the widest business class seats I know of making it possible to sleep comfortably. Bedding composes of a thick blanket and a pillow but there is no seat cover or turn down service provided. Unfortunately they do also not provide slippers. Both flights were on time and at BKK priority cards for immigration were handed out on disembarcation and bags were quickly delivered in the arrivals halls.

### "ground staff at BAH were good"
Bahrain to Istanbul in 2016. The ground staff at BAH were good, security control not as fast as in UAE. Aircraft was clean and food was a hot meal which was served during the first hour, allowing the rest of the flight to resting, watching films or sleeping. Arrived at IST on time.

### "Aircraft clean and polite cabin crew"
Morning flight from Dubai to Bahrain. Used Merhaba services for a member of my family needing a wheelchair. Ground staff were excellent and security and passport control were speedy and efficient. Flight duration of an hour and 15 minutes with a snack. Aircraft clean and polite cabin crew. The same GF disadvantage of the seat handles not going all the way up as in same aircraft of other carriers.

### "Cabin crew efficient and polite"
Flown out of Bahrain to Dubai. Evening flight. Ground staff at BAH very helpful as wheelchair needed for a member of my family. Food on this flight was only a chicken sandwich as duration is about an hour and a quarter. Cabin crew efficient and polite, and inflight entertainment as good as it can for such a short period of time.

### "In-flight service was pretty good"
Flew Gulf Air from Istanbul to Bahrain. Check in at IST was efficient but not as speedy as in other airports probably because economy passengers are more than business and ground staff do not speak English that well. Aircraft cabin was clean as well as the lavatories. The food was ok, but cutlery was made of some sort of sturdy plastic and not stainless steel. In-flight service was pretty good - staff were extremely helpful and polite. The seats are not that comfortable in GF, as handles between seats do not go all the way up as in other airlines - this can be uncomfortable if travelling with spouse as I usually do! Entertainment on board was satisfactory - it helps though if have own headphones - GF's own are reusuable.

### "In-flight entertainment better"
Bahrain to London. Very satisfactory flight, Boarding done quite quickly although there was a lot of hassle. Cabin crew attentive for so late in the evening, In-flight entertainment better than last time although could be improved. Food was good, I was satisfied and asked whether I wanted more. Slept quite well and woke up to a nice breakfast.

### "Overall good experience"
London to Bahrain. Pleasant traveling, on time, left at 10:00 am, delicious food, comfortable seat, crew are nice and sometimes attentive, and amenities satisfactory. Lunge had a nice view onto the aircraft and was very spacious. Only complaint was the inflight entertainment, there aren’t many options and doesn’t entertains you for a long time if your picky. Overall good experience.

### Gulf Air customer review
Abu Dhabi to Beirut via Bahrain. Both legs were on board A320. The first leg on a new clean A320, the FA was helpful and they distributed a small pastry snack with water, cant complain for a 1 hour flight. The leg room was fine on both flights and seats were comfy. The 2 hours BAH transit was smooth. On the leg from BAH to BEY, an older A320 but still clean. We got a full lunch on 9:30 which is weird but so fine and yummy (chicken pasta), their food is better than Emirates food I had previously. The IFE is outdated and limited, and thats my only complaint (playing an ad for an exhibit in March 2017 and we are in September 2017! ), but fine. I recommend them and will fly them again. Things to improve: - Update the IFE system - Their frequent flyer program is not working, u can register but has issues and cant insert it at all (gives error).

### "experience was pretty good"
London to Bahrain. The whole experience was pretty good. Not problems with check in either way. Both flights left slightly early and arrive early. On the flight, seats were as good as any other economy with better than average leg room. IFE was sufficient. Food was quite acceptable. Only negative on the outbound was someone having a severe attack of flatulence for most of the flight. Not the airlines fault and the flight attendants did bring some air freshener for the people in the row in front of me. The culprit remained unidentified! The cost was around 1/8 of what BA asked, which is why I switched to Gulf this time. I think it was a better experience overall, though no airmiles to collect.

### "says flight is overbooked"
Bahrain to Chennai. I had a confirmed economy ticket and went to book my luggage at 1945 for a 2150 hrs departure flight. After a few taps on the keyboard the agent calls up in his intercom and asks for a confirmation. After 2 to 3 mins of refreshing the screeen he asks me to go over customer service and take my boarding pass. One piece of my baggage is on the scale, which the agent advises he will keep it. Over to the customer service another agent taps the keyboard for 3 mins and then informs me to "come back at 2100 hrs". I ask him the reason, he says flight is overbooked and though I have a confirmed ticket nothing can be done. The customer service agent then goes inside the office for further consultation and I see his supervisor shruggging his shoulders and dismissing the customer service agent. I demand for the boarding pass to be issued. I am then confronted by the Supervisor in the customer service asking me to vacate the area. I hold my stance and insist for the release of boarding pass. Then I am directed to another agent in the customer service who offers me Business Class for a whopping BD 150 extra, and thus my travel could be ensured. I meekly accept the option and BD 150 flies off my wallet, and I am already exhausted by the day long travel to Bahrain.

### "not the service you expect"
We have used Gulf Air regularly, however we will not be using them again - they have gone downhill fast. The planes are old, the staff were not at all friendly and more interested in talking to each other or sleeping then serving customers. The food was poor and tasteless. The last leg of the flight two under 3 years olds screamed constantly - no help or assistance was offered. No Sky Nanny. The inflight entertainment was pathetic, old films and little choice. Paying over £3200 for two business class tickets this is not the service you expect.

### "Will never use again"
London to Colombo via Bahrain. Currently writing this review sat in Bahrain Airport as we are delayed for 6 hours after a 4 hour flight from Colombo. On the outgoing journey from London Heathrow to Colombo via Bahrain our luggage was left in Bahrain which meant no clothes for the first two days of our trip and additional money spent on taxis back to the airport to collect the luggage and also costs of clothes, suncream and insect protection for the two days. Unapologetic staff, terrible inflight entertainment and unhelpful staff at Bahrain airport. Will never use again.

### "needs a lot of improvement"
London to Lahore via Bahrain in February. Service between London and Bahrain was fantastic but the service between Bahrain and Lahore was awful and needs a lot of improvement. The toilets were dirty, food was not up to the mark, staff was poor and the seats were dirty. In flight entertainment was not available. Gulf Air needs to provide equal services on all its routes.

### "pleasant and hospitable"
Chennai to Bahrain. Ground staff in Chennai Airport were particularly attentive knowing I was elderly and travelling alone. Cabin crew on board my flight were pleasant and hospitable. The breakfast I was served was not very nice taking into consideration it was a Business Class meal. The eggs were not to my liking, but I did enjoy the bakery and other condiments. The seats was not a flat bed but it was okay for a medium haul flight and the IFE could be improved.

### "legroom is really good"
Bangkok to Frankfurt via Bahrain in December 2016. Comparing longhaul economy class of Gulf Air with economy class of established airlines, Gulf Air can compete with those in terms of comfort and food. The only real letdown is the entertainment system. There  is an IFE system installed but there should be a lot more variety. Nevertheless in my personal opinion seating comfort is worth more than having 200 movies available. The cabin on the A330s seems to be newly refurbished. Legroom on their A330s is as far as I can say bigger than on other airlines A330s. Bonus is the comfort on their A320s which they are using from BAH to FRA. Due to the fact that they are operating the A320 on its max range I guess the number of pax is limited. As a result those A320s seem to be kind of modified longhaul A320s with only a small number of seats in longhaul configuration. Therefore legroom is really good and the atmosphere is not as crowded as it is on other wide body economy flights.

### "prices are cheaper than Emirates"
Colombo to Dubai via Bahrain. I choose Gulf Air because it's ticket prices are cheaper than Emirates, Qatar, Srilankan or etc. Actually I wonder how they manage to maintain an airline like this. Because they have very few passengers for a flight. In flight entertainment is bad compared to Emirates. Food is good but very limited. All the facilities we have to ask for (blanket, extra juice). The airport facility also good, wifi/toilet facility are very good. I had 10hrs transit at Baharain and they give me meal card (wrote on boarding pass) so I can have lunch from sky lounge on 4th floor.

### "They were really ruthless"
Frankfurt to Colombo via Bahrain. I was really upset that I decided to travel with Gulf Air even it was cheap. The ground staff in Frankfurt and Bahrain acted without any heart. They were really ruthless. They did not allow me to take my essential baby stuff to the flight. An even at that last stage, they had very bad customer care. In the flight, you will not get any blanket or pillow. This is first and last. Do not fly.

### "this airline was horrifying"
Our experience with this airline was horrifying to say the least. Not only that they had over 4.5 hours delay that they couldn't explain. This delay pushed us to miss our next flight to NY. The desk manager didn't make any effort to find us another flight to make our connection, and instead asked us to call the connecting airline to try to get in the next flight. Of course, the other airline was not willing to help since it wasn't their fault. When asked to speak to another manager, he wouldn't cooperate. This is the worst airline customer service we have ever seen! We have decided to take on the next flight and connect with another airline.

### "managed to get me on onboard"
❎ Unverified |  Having seen a number of negative reviews, I was quite hesitant to book with Gulf Air. Flew from Bahrain to Abu Dhabi. I was delayed due to traffic and arrived 30 minutes before take off, I had bags to check and ran to the desk, the gentleman was pleasant, immediately called his manager and managed to get me on onboard the flight. Flight was on time and arrived early for this 50 minute hop. Crew were pleasant and water and sandwich handed out. Flight was smooth and the flight deck were engaging. Overall no better or worse than Etihad or Emirates, I would definitely use them again.

### "despicable customer service"
Riyadh to Abu Dhabi via Bahrain with Gulf Air. We arrived at Riyadh airport check in gate to discover there was a 2.15 hour delay. The service agent working the desk could not tell us why there was a delay nor could he offer any sympathy. We proceeded to wait for 3.5 hours until the flight finally arrived from Bahrain to board. We had a connecting flight to Abu Dhabi that we were promised we would make. We landed at 1200 and the flight was planned to leave at 1220. We ran, first off the plane to the gate which was closed. Even though we could see the plane still there. We ran to the transfer desk and were met with some of the worst customer service agents I have ever seen. None of this was our fault. Yet they made us feel that way. We were never apologized to nor did we even receive a smile. They would not call anyone to open the gate for us to make our flight instead begrudgingly gave us a boarding pass to the next available flight which was another 3 hours later. Again. Never received an apology or compensation or a remote amount of sympathy. I Will never fly with this airline again. I'm so disappointed. It has taken me 11 hours to get somewhere that should be a 2 hour flight. And I would feel better if at least one of the service agents had empathy for what we were going through as travellers. Despicable customer service. I have never been so taken aback at the customer service of an airline and I've been on over 24 flights in the past year.

### "An awful airline"
An awful airline. A 5 hour delays, no compensation and not even a reply from their customer service. I flew from Paris with the flight on February 8th to Bangkok with a stop in Bahrain. I learned when landing in Bahrain that the flight to Bangkok GF152Y was delayed by 5 hours. I hardly received any excuse from the staff, the customer service never answered my emails and I had no compensation at all. I stayed 7 hours in the terrible Bahrain airport in the middle of the night, had nothing to drink nor eat.

### "highly satisfactory alternative"
Bangkok to Abu Dhabi via Bahrain. Given it cost me less than an economy ticket on one of the other gulf-based airlines, I treated myself to an upgrade for the return home. After the travails of the outward flight, I feared the worse particularly when the dreaded Gulf Air 'bad news SMS' arrived the evening before. The flight would be late, but only by an hour or so. Not a problem; the transit at Bahrain was over two hours. No queue at check-in, as to be expected, and fast-tracked through immigration and security which can be a mare at BKK. The general lounge used by Gulf was perfectly serviceable with an adequate selection of food and beverages. On joining the plane, I was greeted by a friendly crew who were attentive throughout; so happens the steward / chef was Scottish. Food was tasty albeit limited in choice compared to other operators. Likewise the vanity kit was basic. There again, why do you need anything flash? You only have to pay for it! As on the outward flight the IFR was technically excellent, not least the headphones, but woefully lacking in content. If there was any wifi, it wasn't promoted. However, you fly business class for the seat not the goodies. And this offered excellent space - six across - and comfort, and relatively new by the looks of things. Although traditional in design - it was just a seat, as is my personal preference - I had no sense of my immediate neighbours' presence. As initially advised by Gulf, the flight arrived in Bahrain an hour late. Annoyingly, although it is the norm in this part of the world, we were forced onto a bus to the terminal for no obvious reason. After a short spell in the Falcon lounge, which is excellent, eventual arrival in Abu Dhabi was 15 minutes ahead of schedule. In summary, a pleasant flight. Not up to Emirates or Qatar Airways standards, true. But if you're not able or prepared to pay the prices of these other, Gulf Air offers a highly satisfactory alternative if - and it's a very big if - its ageing planes stay healthy.

### "trying desperately hard to survive"
Abu Dhabi to Bangkok via Bahrain. Gulf Air was once the premier airline in the region. Today what's left of its long haul business relies on six ageing and by all accounts increasingly unreliable A330s. The slightest unscheduled disruption can, and does, lead to service meltdown. Although we were forewarned by Gulf there'd be problems at Bahrain - a quick check on flight tracking websites suggested at least two A330s had been taken out of service - this did not prepare us for the chaotic scenes on arrival with all long haul flights either cancelled or operating many hours if not days behind schedule. Good point: Gulf Air had done the honourable and organised 5* hotel accommodation and food for the day in Bahrain. Bad point: they neglected to tell us prior to arrival; we only found out by word of mouth after wasting the best part of an hour in various queues. Once we eventually departed the flight was satisfactory; food and service good, legroom tight but no worse than others in cattle class, an excellent inflight system with, alas, nothing much to watch. Do not expect Emirates or QATAR quality if flying Gulf. However they're a fraction of the price of the aforementioned - our hotel probably cost more than we paid for the tickets - for which a lot can be forgiven. An airline trying desperately hard to survive with the long haul big boys without the resources to do so.

### "Awful customer service"
London Heathrow to Bangkok via Bahrain. We boarded the plane, sat in fairly comfortable seating and reversed to taxi. Was parked for 45 minutes and no movement and no announcement from captain and then moved back to parking bay. Captain then announced there was a problem and we won't be flying for another hour. Wasn't too much of a problem but no drink or food and wasn't allowed to get off the plane. Hour past, still no movement and no announcement, hour later (2 hours and 45minutes after departure time) the problem will take another 1 hour and 30 minutes to fix. Still couldn't get off plane but water was supplied and awful biscuits. Finally 4 hours and 25 minutes in a plane at the parking bay we left. Awful, we should of been allowed off and given food vouchers for the delay. Because they held the next flight we aren't in the European regulation EC261 for compensation as we landed in Bangkok 2 hours late. Awful customer service and disappointment as return flight was much better.

### "flight was delayed by 2 hours"
London to Chennai via Bahrain. The fare was very cheap compared to other airlines. The aircraft are of an average standard and quite old. Inflight entertainment is very bad and boring. Staff are pleasant and accommodating. Food is also of average standard. The biggest issue with Gulf Air is the punctuality. I have been checking some of the flights since I booked my ticket and on several occasions the LHR bound flight had been delayed by more that 2 hours. The outbound flight was uneventful however the inbound flight from Chennai to Bahrain was delayed by 1 hour and even more frustrating to find that the Bahrain - London flight was delayed by 2 hours. Not very pleasant when having to wait for another 2 hours on top of a long 3 hour wait in a very small airport.

### "very long tiring 2 days"
Bangkok to London Heathrow via Bahrain. The aircraft was very good, the staff were very helpful. Unfortunately on arriving at Bangkok airport, we were told that there was a delay of 5hrs (i.e flight was to have left at 8.50pm, but was not due to leave until 01.05, but did not leave until 01.22). When I asked at check in at Bangkok why it was delayed, they where very vague) this then meant that the connecting flight from Bahrain which we were due to catch at 02.00 was of course gone, so had to then wait a further 4hrs, so instead of getting into Heathrow at 06.35 Tuesday am, did not get back till 2.30pm (approx. I then had to find another way back to Portsmouth as the taxi I had booked was no longer there. Since then I have been trying to get some form of compensation, but as Bangkok and Bahrain are not EU countries I'm unable to and also Gulf Air is not an EU aircraft, I get nothing. Very disappointed, as no explanation was given and none of it was my fault. It was a very long tiring 2 days.

### "no signs of Gulf Air rep"
Dubai to London via Bahrain. We left Dubai at 9:20 pm on 26th December to go to Bahrain for an onward flight to London Heathrow. Flight was nice and, when I noticed that we should have reached Bahrain, an announcement by pilot was made that due to fog in Bahrain, we are diverting flight to Kuwait Airport. We landed in Kuwait around 10.40pm local time. Finally the plane stopped, sandwiches and water were served by flight attendants and then after some time pilot announced that we will be taken to Kuwait Airport lobby as the flights will not fly until 7.00 am next day and we will be greeted by Gulf Air reps in the airport (around 11.00 pm local time) . This was the last time we heard a Gulf Air representative for next 8-9 hours. Kuwait airport, although an international airport, is pretty much like a small tunnel with limited shops and uncomfortable seats. The buses dumped us at the airport and we entered in the airport to find a crowded airport. It was chaos; we reached at other airline transit desk and waited about an hour to speak with Gulf Air rep, nobody turned up. At this desk, some Airport staff appeared and asked all of Gulf Air passengers to go to gate number 2. Well, gate number 2 was locked and there were no signs of Gulf Air rep there too. By this time at had been there about two hours. All passengers had nowhere to go, no food, no water not even a chair available to sit. Agitated, some passengers tried to go to Gulf Air Lounge but lounge service lady there, claimed that she is nothing to do with Gulf Air and could not help anybody. At 7am in morning the first Gulf Air rep came at transit desk. An abrupt announcement was made that the flights to Bahrain will be departing in next hours or so get your Boarding pass. The stranded passengers rushed to transit desk where two people were issuing new boarding pass. What a painful two hours, standing in the queue, with few staff working, boarding passes were issued. The flight to Bahrain left at around 10.00 am and reached around 11.00 am in Bahrain.

### "cheap tickets not worth it"
Dubai to London via Bahrain. Absolutely disgraceful, reached London a day later than expected. Flight from Dubai was nearly 15 hours late due to fog at Dubai Airport. Gulf air staff were totally lost with the whole situation and had no update on the correct time when the flight will be going. 1 McDonalds complimentary meal for the inconvenience caused. Reached bahrain to find out flight to London is further delayed. The 4.00am flight did not leave on time, they had to re-board all, re check and scan, although everyone had been through security. I reached London to find out that the baggage is missing. So had to return home with no bags. A horrendous experience, Gulf Air staff at Heathrow, Dubai and Bahrain were of no use. The cheap tickets are definitely not worth it.

### "most likely not use again"
The flight to Bangkok did make an overall good impression. Good food options for someone who picks a diabetic meal. However, due to poor weather conditions my flights (Bangkok to Bahrain and then to London) were all affected and dealt with with such a poor quality. I would have expected a much more organisation in Bahrain. When I came for my finally rescheduled flight after being redirected to land in Doha and having waited at the airport for 12 hours with the lack of airline staff and updates - no information was given only that we need to sit and wait at gate c13. Hours passed and we had to ourselves go and look all around the airport for any staff until when we found it to get no information. In Bahrain, I had my second leg rescheduled and when I arrived at the airport, that was delayed as well. In the airport there was no such flight on the screen. No crew members or customer service for economy passengers from the airline even though the airline is the airline of Bahrain. How is that? Sleeping at the airport for another 6 hours, with no information - on the board it says the flight has been rescheduled to 2.50, then for 5.20 but the time is already 6 in the morning. Then it has been changed to 5.20, after which no new information is given, and everyone is waiting with no crew member to come and explain or even give any information through the speakers. I do understand it is the weather which is out of control of the airline, but there should be organised crew to accommodate all the passengers for such unexpected events. At least someone to come and give us updates at least once an hour. Not leaving passengers with no signs of guidance for many hours of stress. Food is good. Air crew is exceptional. Ground crew is of unacceptable quality. I have been left with unpleasant feelings about the airline only from the way they have dealt with this situation and being under so much stress while looking for answers and being provided with no clear options of being offered accommodation or some other comfort while waiting for 12 hours in Doha. I will most likely not use their services again.

### "seemed clumsy at times"
Athens to Abu Dhabi via Bahrain. Thought we would give Gulf Air a try. Initially I was apprehensive as I thought the A320 would be too small for the Athens to Bahrain 3hr 50 min flight. Though a small aircraft the seating is very comfortable with a pillow and inflight entertainment on each seat, and plenty of leg room. The food provided was good enough so was the drink variety. The only slightly negative aspect is that the staff are lacking professionalism and seemed clumsy at times but apart from that a very good airline.

### "catering was of a high standard"
This was my first time flying with Gulf Air. Overall the experience was good but there are some definite areas where Gulf Air could easily enhance the passenger experience. I booked my flights on the Gulf Air website, the booking and seat selection process was generally easy however the website would not accept my American Airlines frequent flyer number (I think because it is alpha-numeric). I checked in using the mobile version of the Gulf Air website, this was also easy to use but there were some more minor issues; the AAdvantage number was accepted but the system didn't like my passport number (again this seemed to be because it is alpha-numeric). Fast track security at Heathrow was efficient and the Gulf Air T4 lounge was spacious, had good views of the ramp and a good selection of complimentary food and beverage items. The boarding process was efficient and there was a warm welcome from the Cabin Manager at the boarding door. Prior to departure passengers were offered a welcome drink as well as arabic coffee and dates. The cabin is configured 2x2x2 with seats upholstered in leather. I found the seat comfortable in a seated and reclined position but not so much in the sleeping position due to being sloped. Upon boarding however I noticed a dirty tissue in the side compartment of my seat (presumably missed by the cleaners) and attention to detail with cabin cleanliness seemed to be lacking. The crew were profusely apologetic about this. The onboard service from the Cabin Crew was warm, attentive and friendly and catering was of a high standard. The crew regularly offered drink refills and had a good presence in the cabin. Unfortunately I was served one drink in a dirty glass and again the crew were very apologetic. The transfer to my connecting flight in BAH was easy and the lounge in BAH was of a similar standard to the LHR lounge. Strangely the gate agent for the BAH-AUH sector had to hand write boarding passes for any passengers (including me) who presented mobile boarding passes. This created a delay at the gate and seems to defeat the purpose of a mobile boarding pass if the staff literally have to write one out by hand (something I have never seen before). The short hop to AUH on was an A320ER with the same seats as found on the A330 but in a 2x2 configuration, very nice for such a short sector.

### "Worst experience ever"
Worst experience ever with Gulf Air yesterday. I was booked to fly Dubai to Bangkok via Bahrain in business class. Just at the time of check in, I received a notification that the DXB-BAH flight was delayed by 1.15 hrs which meant that I would lose my connecting flight GF152 BAH-BKK. I mentioned this and showed the message to GF check-in but they insisted that the flight was not delayed and issued my boarding passes. I refused and asked them to wait as I was not keen to travel to BAH on a delayed flight and find my connecting one to BKK departed from there. The check in staff was adamant and almost impolite. A few minutes wait later they admitted there was a delay and I would thereby miss my connection from BAH. I asked to be endorsed on another airline as I had a day full of work meetings the following day. After a great deal of time, they offered me a seat on another airline on economy class without any compensation! The check in staff completely disinterested and said this was the final offer and there was no Gulf Air representative available. He showed little interest in my plight and went around walking and chatting with his team members. He advised that a Gulf Air representative will be there in 20 minutes. Finally after 35 minutes Gulf Air's staff arrived and repeated the same offer. He told me that I could fly to BAH on the delayed flight and would be accommodated in a hotel there until the following nights flight to BKK. This was unacceptable as it meant I lose an entire day of work and am lodged in BAH for a whole day for no reason. He asked me to take it or leave it as this was the only offer. To me this was unacceptable to be downgraded to Economy with no compensation. He told me that I was free to purchase a new ticket on another airline of my choice but Gulf Air will not compensate me. Gulf Air let me down yesterday with its delay and made it worse by showing its Falcon Gold customer no respect or attention they deserve. I had no choice but to cancel my trip altogether as I was not keen to fly economy when booking a business class.

### "buy new ticket rather than fly Gulf Air"
The first part of the flight from Heathrow to Bahrain was okay, not the best but the flight was virtually empty no more than 25 people in my section. We were encouraged to move around and make use of all the free space. However, while waiting in transit to continue the journey to Bangkok the flight which was due take leave at 22.20 was delayed by 10 hours until the next morning. This delay was not announced at the gate and it wasn't until we checked the board that we found out about the delay. Hotel accommodation was provided but it all took far too long. The hotel had arranged an early morning call at 5am to make sure everyone was ready to be transferred back to the airport. Unfortunately, although everyone was up and ready, 10 minutes before 5am I received an email saying that the flight had been delayed until 8pm that night! For some reason some people did not receive the email. This email was too late and we should have been notified sooner. The flight finally left Bahrain almost 24 hours later. I discovered that some people had been delayed from the night before which meant they had been waiting 48 hours and apparently their flight was also very empty. When the flight left it was full to the brim and it was a different plane as our seat numbers did not correspond with those that we had booked and we didn't have the extra leg room that we ad booked. I have emailed the airline on several occasions asking for the delay information in order to make my insurance claim but they have failed to supply this even though it is now outside the 3 week waiting time. In my opinion they simply held the 2 flights over in order to send one full flight, that is all, and it is not acceptable. I have my return ticket for November which I will not use, I would rather buy a new ticket rather than fly Gulf Air!

### "all in all worst experience"
Mumbai to Frankfurt via Bahrain. 14 business class seats have one too small toilet. The entertainment system has very outdated contents. Seats are angled and hence getting sleep is impossible. Since it's A320, the Business class or so called Falcon Gold is connected with other cabin with tons of noise. All in all its very worst flight. Even the staff seems has no care for business class passenger to serve them breakfast. All in all worst experience.

### "worst experience in air travel"
I travelled Gulf Air from Riyadh to Chennai via Bahrain. The flight was delayed more than 15 hours due to technical problem at Riyadh. No proper information about the departure from the ground staff. No airline staff come forward to explain the status about the problem to the passengers. Finally problem was fixed after 15 hours and left to Bahrain. Connecting flight from Bahrain was missed and waited at Bahrain for 8 hours. There was total delay of 24 hours when reaching chennai. There was no alternate arrangements made to the passengers. My worst experience in air travel.

### "staff were courteous"
London to Muscat via Bahrain. I checked in online and dropped off my bags at the airport in a matter of minutes. Ground staff friendly and helpful. A330 clean and looked recently renovated. Economy seats were comfortable and cabin staff were courteous and friendly. The meal was the best I have had in economy class. Plenty of items and a great choice of drinks. Managed to get a sleep on board which was a bonus. The only slight negative was the lack of choice when it came to inflight entertainment. The second flight with a quick stop in Bahrain on an A320 was very comfortable and staff were friendly. Drink and snack was provided and arrived ahead of schedule. I flew back to Bahrain for a short visit then back on to London. I was very impressed with the food, cleanliness of aircraft and staff.

### "friendly flight attendants"
I loved every minute of my flight from Frankfurt to Bahrain with Gulf Air. Check in was quick and easy and the lounge used in Frankfurt was nice too (Cathay Pacific). Once onboard we had spacious flat bed seats and were greeted by friendly flight attendants. The amenity kits were a nice touch. The food was very tasty and I liked the dates and arabic coffee which was served just before takeoff. My only complaint was the somewhat limited selection of in-flight movies and lack of music options.

### "I would recommend them"
The price was good and Gulf Air timings were good for my journey from Heathrow to Bangkok return via Bahrain. The flight was empty from Heathrow and i got a seat to myself by the window. I found seats perfectly fine for both the outward leg and the return one too. The food was tasty and had 3 choices and it came quickly, nice wine but not much choice in spirits (gin please!). The crew were friendly and nothing was too much trouble. I was even offered an extra meal as I was complimentary about my meal from Bahrain to Bangkok! The movie selection was ok but nothing too special, and you had to watch a 2.5 minute Bahrain airshow footage each time you wanted to watch something, which was a bit irritating, but nothing too bad. The moving map was informative and information on local times and eta were handy as well. The plane was clean, blankets offered and the toilets were clean on all of the flights. I couldn't really fault anything major at all. I would recommend them to anyone wanting a good priced scheduled airline that didn't mind a change in Bahrain for longer haul flights.

### "seats were comfortable"
I flew London to Bangkok return via Bahrain, with a very short stopover (1.5 hours) in Bahrain. Every flight left on time, the food was very good, service was friendly and seats were comfortable and plenty of legroom. The IFE was pretty good; not as good as some other airlines but it worked fine and had a good selection of documentaries. For less than £450 return it would be difficult to complain. I can recommend Gulf Air based upon my experience, and would definitely fly with them again.

### "unbeatable quality for the price paid"
Probably not the most luxurious business class product in the skies with Gulf Air, but unbeatable quality for the price paid from Paris CDG to Bangkok via Bahrain. Very relaxed crew, comfortable seat and very decent food. A low-profile airline that deserves to be better known. Would definitely fly with them again.

### "I'd fly them again"
London to Bangkok return via Bahrain. Quick and efficent check-in at Heathrow T4 but despite checking in online I was unable to get my preferred aisle seat. The flight was a little late in departing but most of the delay was made up before arriving in BAH. Economy seats were more comfortable than Emirates with reasonable space on the A330. Cabin service on all flights was nothing special, with fairly surly crews on all legs but food was simple and tasty with plenty of drinks choices. IFE nothing special, but I usually prefer to read or sleep on these night flights. Upon arrival in BKK the aircraft was stopped several hundred metres from the stand and many passengers decided to get up and 'leave'. For the last few minutes of taxi-ing the aisles were jammed with passengers and bags - and the cabin crew sat, watched - and did precisely nothing. It's not a great advertisement for an airline who can't or won't control their passengers. Quick and efficient (10 minute) check-in in BKK. The best part of the trip was transit through Bahrain - courteous and helpful staff (something which Dubai often lacks), clean uncrowded toilets and a sensible sized terminal. Boarding was a bit disorganised but otherwise okay, and generally pretty quick. I've flown Gulf before and I'd fly them again.

### "unimpressive journey"
Hyderabad to London via Bahrain with Gulf Air was a very forgettable and unimpressive journey. Having flown other middle east airlines (Emirates, Etihad, Qatar, Oman) I wanted to try Gulf Air as well. The first leg (4.5 hours) was in a very hot cabin and it was quite uncomfortable. The food was just okay and the entertainment system was rather poor compared to those of rivals in the region (for January they have a focus on Julia Roberts and have about 15 movies of hers, in theory a great idea but not when the overall offering is not that big). There were too many automated PAs and the FAs lacked training or character. On the Bahrain to London leg the passenger sitting next to me was give a non-veg meal even though he had ordered a Hindu vegetarian meal so he had to ask for fruit so as to eat something. 30 minutes before landing his meal was located, at which point it was too late. The A330 was refurbed and showed it, seats were okay though on the tighter side. Given the marginal cost differential between Gulf and other carriers I would pick any of the other ones.

### "staff friendly enough"
London to Dubai via Bahrain return on Gulf Air. Upgraded to Business Class on the London to Bahrain leg. Good check in, lounge okay at Heathrow Terminal 4. Comfortable beds with plenty of room in the cabin - only 18 business class seats. Service was good with excellent food and a good choice of quality wines. Cabin staff were very attentive. Only criticism is the IFE. In both classes, it was very mediocre to say the least. Bahrain to Dubai leg was in economy class. Not a seat free in a very cramped aircraft (A321). The only blessing on an awful flight was that it was only 50 minutes. The return leg was in economy class. Fortunately, we got exit row seats with plenty of leg room, but looking around, the A330 economy experience did not look too bad - food was fine, staff friendly enough and plenty of drinks if you asked. Given the price, Gulf Air was not such a bad experience. Would probably use again if better alternatives were at the then same extortionate prices.

### "a lovely flight"
Gulf Air direct flight between Delhi and Bahrain, A321 in Business Class, there is a wonderful sense of space. Business class seat becomes a full flat bed, comes with noise-cancelling ear-set, a pillow and on request a blanket. I chose the Arabic Mezze for my starter, the Grilled Chicken with mushroom and jus (for main-course), and Gulab Jamun for dessert. The mezze and the chicken were just fabulous. Service could have been a bit more personal, but the stewardess was polite and courteous. One touch I really liked, I had just woken up from my sleep and the stewardess offered me a lovely cup of cappuccino - that is the hallmark of good service. The Purser assisting the stewardess was an older man of few words, but professional, which is fine. Overall, a lovely flight, and I can't wait to review the return flight from Bahrain to Delhi

### "flights were on time"
Bangkok to London via Bahrain. Check in at BKK was fine and efficient. Flight landed about 40 mins early at Bahrain problem was had to wait for preceding flight to leave for about 20 mins. Flight was quite full and one guy was really annoying asking for things all the time like beer. The FAs I think tried to please him, he got his food first etc. FAs were rather abrupt and not very friendly. Anyway the flight from Bahrain to LHR was different, only about 1/4 full, FAs were friendly and helpful. One nice touch when I was falling asleep a FA covered my legs with a blanket. Entertainment was not good compared to Emirates. Seats I did not find that comfortable but enough room. Will fly with them again, times are good for me and all flights were on time.

### "legroom on A330 very poor"
London to Muscat via Bahrain with Gulf Air. Acceptable for economy class. The food was adequate, staff friendly, entertainment just fine. However the seat pitch and leg room on the A330 was very poor for a long flight from London to Bahrain. It was better on the A321 for the short Bahrain to Muscat - Bahrain sectors.

### "staff were miserable and unfriendly"
Really disappointed that I chose to fly with Gulf Air. We travelled with our one year old who was too young for his own seat and too heavy for a baby bassinet. The airline seats at the front of economy were cramped and didn't allow for the arm rests to be raised. I therefore spent 7 hours holding my child while he slept. This meant that I could not eat or drink until after my wife had finished. The staff on our outbound flight were miserable and unfriendly. Our return flight was extremely hot. Our entertainment system on both the outbound and inbound flight was stuck, and when we asked for help we were told to push down a button which didn't work so we went the entire flight without any entertainment.

### "food was nothing special"
First I have to deduct at least one star for the pilot who came on the PA before we took off from Bahrain with a friendly greeting and then told us the weather would be fine all along the way and then after 15 minutes past take off we flew for 2 hours in a violent thunderstorm. Gulf Air is not a bad airline, but unfortunately it is not a good one either. Flights had a chef, but the food was nothing special. FA's were not particularly attentive, forgetting to bring my drink order and then disappearing most of the night. The onboard entertainment is just unwatchable. The seats in the new A330 were nice, not fancy, much like Qatar Airways seats, but the spacing between seats was enormous. That said, every employee was quite nice and seemed to want to do a good job. They just don't seem to have their vision quite figured out. Given the other options in the region, this would be my last choice.

### "service was quite friendly"
The A320 on both legs of the journey Dammam to Karachi via Bahrain seemed new with comfortable seats and ample seat pitch so that even a tall guy like me can stretch his legs without difficulty. The service was quite friendly with staff smiling even to the most annoying passengers. Food was quite delicious. Best thing about the journey was on time arrival on both legs.

### "inflight entertainment was truly dreadful"
Gulf Air from Bahrain to Manila, and sadly the cabin is tired and seats hard, worn and uncomfortable. Cabin crew in general were good and the food was good with 4 choices on main course. It seems the onboard chef on this route no longer flies as the food is all pre-packed now, which is a shame. The inflight entertainment was truly dreadful and is in desperate need of upgrading to the likes of Qatar Airways and other Middle Eastern carriers. Gulf Air, get this done as this is a big letdown on a 9 1/2 hour flight.

### Gulf Air customer review
London to Jeddah via Bahrain. Check-in fantastic at London. Gulf Air offer a decent Economy Class product with nice entertainment, although that can be improved. Food was decent and staff seemed nice, however they should try engage in more conversation with passengers. After our long transit in Bahrain Airport we boarded our flight to Jeddah on an A321. Boarding was chaotic, staff were rude to first time pilgrim flyers who couldn't locate their seats. Gulf Air offers an good Economy class product for A321 with decent Entertainment. However this flight wasn't as good as the London to Bahrain flight.

### Gulf Air customer review
I've been a Gulf Air gold or silver card holder for 15 years, so I have travelled with them a lot. Howvever, one of Gulf Air's regular 'habits' is to let you board a plane with little or no A/C, even in the middle of summer. This means that at the very start of a long day you start sweating, your clothes become drenched in perspiration and by the end of the day you feel really uncomfortable. They do this so regularly now that it is not an accident. None of the other airlines do it and I'm guessing they think they are being cute and saving money. However, I've had enough of it and won't be flying with them again due to this reason. I'm fed up with stinking of sweat at the end of a very long day of meetings in foreign places. Not for me.

### Gulf Air customer review
Having flown with Emirates and Eithad, I was looking forward to a good service from Gulf Air. This was my first experience flying with them and probably the last. The food served was horrible. The air stewards and stewardess could not speak clear English hence, were rude to most of the passengers who could not understand what they were saying. They were not very efficient or attentive to passengers. I had to call them twice to be given a blanket since it was very cold onboard. The inflight entertainment movie selection was very poor when compared to Emirates  who have a better selection.

### Gulf Air customer review
We got an offer for 500GBP per person at last minute. The plane from London to Bahrain was awful - delayed boarding. Crew were unkind. The food was served late, even after many requests for some snacks (my kids got hungry), the crew didn't manage to give anything. There were no vegetarian options left. The entertainment was cut off during half the flight. However, once in Bahrain everything went smoothly. The check-in was delightful. The crew were very pleasant and the flights were on time. The food was very nice and the entertainment was perfect. Our return was perfect - the only down side was the first journey.

Flew London to Abu Dhabi via Bahrain. London to Bahrain on board an A330. Check in was fast with no issues. On board was not so clean. Old headphones in the seat pocket, tissue under the seat. Pretty empty flight so moved to the first row in economy which had loads of legroom. Seats onboard are very hard and quite uncomfortable for a long flight. IFE was ok. Not a huge selection and for some strange reason, my IFE showed more movies and shows than my partners. Food was pretty average on all legs with only 1 drinks service on each leg. On the retuern leg, cabin staff were nowhere to be seen. Only seen when they took first class food to the rear of the plane for them to eat. The Bahrain to Abu Dhabi leg was great. Short flight with a quick food service. Seats on this part were great. Much much comfier than the long haul section. All in all I would say Gulf Air need to improve in a few areas to be as good as most other middle eastern airlines. I was a bit disappointed and would not fly with them again if I can help it. Very average.

### Gulf Air customer review
I had not flown Gulf for many years, their business class was old and tired, and had 160 degree angled seats, which I find very uncomfortable. I had read many reviews regarding their new Falcon Gold business class, and at a really super price return Bangkok-London, I gave them a second chance. Lounge was nice, security at Bahrain was fast, lounge again very nice. The cabin was a breath of fresh air compared to before, lie flat seats, good food, free flowing wine, I enjoyed the experience. Inflight movie selection was ok, but small selection. It's not Emirates A380, or Emirates lounges, but at 40% less in price, they have my business as long as they don't get expensive again.

I recently traveled to and from Bahrain using Gulf Air. I was up until 2 years ago a silver frequent flyer but because I had not visited there for a while I have dropped down to blue. The difference in flying this time compared to 2 years ago was incredible. I was really impressed with everything. Staff both on the ground and in the air were courteous friendly and helpful and on the return flight included two young newly trained stewardesses who were an absolute delight. The screens and seats have all been upgraded and the in flight entertainment was much improved. The food was also very good. I will definitely be flying with Gulf Air again.

LHR-BAH-ISB 27 March 2015. The check-in was good as I had checked in online so shorter queue at that counter flight left on time for BAH. I had exit seats so plenty of space FA very helpful and courteous although seat comfort less desirable very hard and uncomfortable. The food was ok but portions were smaller than I expected. The IFE was also good but lacks variety. The transit at BAH was quick and airport is small but very nice and clean. Flight from BAH to ISB was the best as I got an upgrade to business class which was excellent. The food choice was great and seats were comfortable. Arrived on time and would fly again.

### Gulf Air customer review
CDG-BAH-MCT one way. Unusual 6 hour flight in A320 for CDG-BAH leg but actually the small cabin and good long- haul seats makes this a comfortable flight. I had exit seat but the pitch seemed better that on many bigger planes. Cabin was fine. IFE was good and food was above average. It was a day flight but we were given mask earplugs and socks – Oman Air does not. FAs were nice and one was particularly kind and smiley. Also very nice ground staff in Paris. Plane was half empty and from other reviews this seems frequent on that leg with the small cabin it gives an excellent feeling. The only downside was that the seat cushion was not good (Recaro seats). I would definitely fly GF again with that plane on that leg. Due to traffic in CDG connection was extremely short in BAH (slow bus transfer does not help!) I had to rush but my luggage arrived safely. Short BAH-MCT flight was nothing special we were given a tasty sandwich water and juice.

23/1/15 BKK-BAH-JED GF153. Flight couldn't take off due to technical problems ground staff were totally overloaded with handling this situation. Voucher for meals at BKK airport not even enough to cover a regular meal at Burger King! After waiting 2 hrs on the runway and another 4 hrs in the gate at the airport finally we were brought to a hotel. Sleeping time only 5 hrs to go back to airport where the plane was ready to fly to BAH. No information for passengers how to claim for the delay was presented at the check in counter not mentioned by the staff. Finally we arrived 16 hrs later in BAH. Originally my stopover would be only 2 hrs but due to the delay it was 6 hrs where I was given a free meal in Bahrain's low and old fashioned departure lounge. Finally I reached Jeddah 24 hrs later as scheduled.

I recently flew LHR-BKK return on Gulf Air. The flights were all on time which is always good. The seats are a little bit hard for my liking. The cabin crew are adequate nothing more nothing less. The IFE is not as good as many airlines. The food is very average also on the LHR-BAH and vice versa legs only one meal was served for a 6.5 hour flight and a 7.5 hour flight needless to say I was hungry. The BAH-BKK legs also only have one meal but you get a piece of cake about 50 mins before landing so not great. Only the way home I had a ten hour layover in Bahrain (overnight) I was not offered the option of a hotel or given any food coupons during this period to say this is poor is an understatement! The airline has declined since the last time I flew with them it now feels like a long haul budget airline which is a shame as they used to be outstanding!

### Gulf Air customer review
BKK-BAH-LNH 23rd Jan. Our flight couldn't take off from Bangkok due to wing problems and had to wait two hours on the runway before being led to the immigration where they had apparently booked a hotel for us. Unfortunately the wait for the hotel was over 6 hours. This left about 5 hours sleep until the replacement flight on the same aircraft. The flight to Bahrain was delayed by 2 hours and when we finally left we were treated by staff that were clearly resenting working with the public and did not care to help. When arriving in Bahrain we were told the wait for our next flight to Heathrow would involve 7 hours in Bahrain's mediocre departure lounge. The only reason I couldn't give this a zero rating is that they offered free food vouchers in the airport as compensation. Over 35 hours waiting from Friday we arrived in London Sunday on a flight which was supposed to take 16 hours all together. Gulf Air really need to up their game!

### Gulf Air customer review
BAH-MNL on the same tired old plane that I flew back in September as no refit had been done so a very dull business class cabin with a very poor outdated IFE system with old films. DVD players were handed out but really the IFE is in desperate need of a major upgrade. Food was again very good with a good choice. My seat wasn't working so had to stand up to operate it to work properly so again the maintenance on this plane is sadly lacking. A poor flying experience sadly on this route and I expect the same again on my return journey next month.

LHR-BAH-LHR J Class. Excellent overall. Crew friendly and welcoming. Nothing was too much trouble. Food good but not excellent. Chef was helpful. IFE weak when compared to neighbours product. On time flights. Will fly again.

### Gulf Air customer review
Second entry this time return flights from Muscat to Heathrow via Bahrain (GF561 GF3). Check-in in Muscat a breeze aircraft an A320 departed slightly early and arrived in Bahrain on time. Although the flight is only an hour and a half served with a hot breakfast item and usual drinks. Crew friendly enough and seat pitch very good even for a six footer like me (1.90m). Two hours to connect in Bahrain which was a breeze too. Flight to Heathrow was on the smaller A320 and not the usual larger A330 and this was probably good as the seat pitch is better in the smaller Gulf Air airbuses. Flight was not full so not surprising they were using the A320. Usual clean and airy cabin crew friendly food very good in flight entertainment quite good although the 320 has slightly different kit to the A330 so no USB port and headphone socket is two pin! Flight departed Bahrain on time and arrived at Heathrow slightly early bags arrived too. Very pleased with Gulf Air and would I use them again? I would.

### Gulf Air customer review
Just flown GF2 LHR-BAH (Airbus 330) Seats 23A/C connecting to GF556 BAH-MCT (Airbus 320) Seats 11E/F. Both economy. After reading some of the reviews on here I was a little concerned however I must say I was very pleased with Gulf Air. We departed late from Heathrow not because of Gulf Air but the usual Heathrow being busy scenario and this meant we would be arrived in Bahrain with a very short connection time of about one hour. The A330 'KC' had been refitted with the new interior which made the cabin smart bright and airy. Seat was comfortable for the six and a half hour journey and I was only just starting to get restless as we arrived. I'm over 6' tall by the way! Cabin crew were very friendly but don't expect much in the way of offerings onboard. We got a drink just after leaving Heathrow then the next offering was two hours later and that was lunch. The food was rather good and I cleared everything! After Lunch the next your get will be just before arrival and that's just orange juice or water. I was starving by the time we arrived in Bahrain but because of the short connection time and arriving late didn't have time to buy anything so next time I would board with supplies. Note that in arrival in Bahrain it will be a bus from the aircraft to the terminal as they park the aircraft up overnight away from the terminal and you'll have to get through another security check too so don't hang about! Bags had been checked through from London so we had everything crossed that they would make it to Muscat too. Flight from BAH-MCT was hassle free the seats actually had more leg room than the flight from London weird! It's only about an hour and a half so comfort not an issue. The aircraft look nearly new so are clean and bright inside and out. You get a cold snack too which was tasty. Crew friendly and both legs and believe it or not our bags arrived too. Well done Gulf Air and fingers crossed it's as good on the way back later this week.

### Gulf Air customer review
Mediocre at best. I live in the Middle East in Oman. The national carrier Oman Air is consistently ranked among the best and its product is very good when compared to other Middle Eastern airlines. Unfortunately however that ranking seems to have gone to Oman Air's head lately and they have not only increased prices dramatically but are apparently also considering cutting a lot of the services and features that have made them a stand out in a field of also-rans. Because they are above what I can afford for last minute leisure trips I chose to fly Gulf Air to London on the routing MCT-BAH-LHR early this month. The pricing is very competitive and their website originally showed me a wonderful pair of flights that would have only meant a short layover of under two hours in Bahrain. Once the payment screen had been completed however I received ticketing on two flight sets that incorporated a 9.5 hour layover in Bahrain on the way to London and a 7.5 hour layover on the return trip. Amazingly while I was lured in with such a terrific original offer I was now going to be spending nearly one day of my break in Bahrain's mediocre International Airport (and in that facility's mediocre Dilmun Lounge - see separate review). At Muscat we were delayed in boarding and is usual with many Middle Eastern airlines no reason was given for the delay - it just was. Boarding the A320 for Bahrain legroom was quite adequate at 34 inches of pitch I had experienced this on previous short-haul flights with Gulf Air and therefore thought they might be just the ticket to avoid rival Oman Air's new inflationary price structure. After landing at Bahrain International and a lengthy stay in the wildly overpriced Dilmun Lounge I boarded the leg for LHR and was amazed that on an A330 any airline would tighten the seat pith to a measly 31 inches which made for a 7 hour torture ride. Luckily on that leg I had a short row (two seats) to myself and was able to mitigate the pain a little. Sadly Gulf Air has revamped its A330s with new leather seats from Recaro arguably the worst airline seat maker out there. Each of their seats on any aircraft features rough Philips-head screws at precisely where my knees are forced to contact the seat in front of me as I am rather tall and have long legs - sheer torture. If the person in front of me then reclines things are beyond the pale of bearable. Again the flight was delayed and of course there was no explanation of any kind. Gulf Air needs to pull up its socks in terms of food service. While the food was excellent there was precious little of it - only one meal service barely two beverage services and nothing more on an intercontinental price. No comfort packet with eye masks no direly needed ear plugs nothing more. Basically the return trip was the same in reverse although push-back from Heathrow was on the dot. Will I fly Gulf Air again? Probably yes but I'll try to limit it to short haul which is their vastly superior product.

### Gulf Air customer review
LHR-BAH-DXB. After reading reviews on various site online I wasn't expecting much from Gulf Air. I was lucky enough to fly on one of their newly retrofitted A330-200 from LHR to BAH. I was pleasantly surprised with the aircraft. The new seats were comfortable the IFE didn't have much choice but was the hardware was top quality. The touch screen unit had an USB port to charge personal devices too which was very useful. The aircraft was clean which you'd expect on a newly retrofitted aircraft. The cabin crew were friendly and helpful. The food was actually very nice but lacking in options. Being a red-eye flight there was at least 70% of the seats empty so I got some decent shut eye! The A320 from BAH to DXB was as full capacity as you'd expect for a regional flight. Again clean aircraft decent seats and helpful crew. The snack wasn't very appetizing. Overall for what I paid (£320) I was very impressed and would recommend this airline if you're flying on a budget.

### Gulf Air customer review
BAH-MNL and plane was an old tired A330 with old seats that were uncomfortable along with a tired looking cabin. Food was the only bright spot which was very good both main meal & the breakfast. The IFE is dreadful and crew had even forgot the portable DVD players so you could not watch any up to date movies or features. This flight is basically carrying workers back home from the Middle East hence it looks like not much effort is being made to upgrade the flight experience on this route sadly. Even though one of the senior cabin crew did state this actual plane is to undergo a refit.

### Gulf Air customer review
GF 154 Bahrain to Manila. The entire economy section is in a terrible state rickety and stained seats. The food was excellent but the crew didn't enforce the "use the lavatories in your section". People we're leaving economy to use the lavatories in business - that is unacceptable. The crew also seemed not to care that when we landed people were up and moving about the cabin during an active taxi creating several potential hazards.

Delhi - Bahrain - London. This is the third time I have flown Gulf Air. First two times were economy and this time business. All times have been good experiences in the respective classes. On time clean friendly cabin crew. The most recent was yesterday and I flew business from Delhi. All I can say is that I couldn't fault them great seats even on the a321 from Delhi which I was expecting to be a jumped up economy seat but was grateful for a flat bed given the 04.45 departure. Bahrain lounge is up there with emirates and BA T5. A330 to LHR was good great seats nice staff and a nice experience. The only very mild criticism would be that there isn't much choice on the IFE but there was enough to keep me occupied. Great job all I simply don't recognise the poor reviews.

### Gulf Air customer review
LHR-BAH-BKK. I read the mixed reviews here before booking business class to Bangkok via Bahrain after seeing Gulf Air has started to refurbish their cabins. First leg LHR-BAH was on a refurbished A330. Seats were excellent far more comfortable than they look. Service was good and food was plenty and above standard for business class. The let down was the AVOD system which was quite limited. After a stay over in Bahrain the second leg to BKK was in a non-refurbished cabin (travel tip: get a set in row 1 or 2 as these seats are better). The cabin was old worn but clean. Service and food matched the first leg and was excellent. The old entertainment system was next to useless but a tablet like device was handed out which was well specked with movies and series and the selection was better than the AVOD system in the refurbished cabin. On arrival to BKK priority immigration cards were handed out and bags arrived quickly on the carousel. For the price an excellent trip and well recommended.

### Gulf Air customer review
Horrible Business Class. Never fly their Business Class. Do not go by the pictures they advertise on their website. The business class that we had from London to Bahrain had reasonable seats (reclining though not flat beds as advertised) service was decent and food good. However Bahrain-Delhi flight (which was a night flight) that we had was a disaster - premium economy seats (not Business Class as promised) which barely reclined no alcoholic drinks offered as apart from our family (and perhaps another couple of people) all other seats were upgrades due to an overbooked flight. Service was quite pathetic and no one seemed to care. Horrible experience. We would strongly advise against taking Business Class on Gulf Air.

BAH-BKK-BAH I was given a middle seat instead of a window seat as I requested when I booked my ticket from Gulf Air (Airport Office) two days before my flight. The check-in staff member was very stiff she did not smile and did not greet the customer! When I requested her a window seat she said the only available seats were middle seats? When I boarded the aircraft the Cabin Crew were chatting with each other rather than greeting and directing passengers to their seats. Zero customer service. The seat was in a very bad condition old and stained the metal frame structure inside the seat cushion was squeezing my back. I had a hard time reclining the seat. Food was really good I enjoyed it. Cabin crew served me a glass of wine when I asked her later for another one the answer was "I will get back to you". I am still waiting for her! I requested earplugs because the child seated in the next aisle was being very loud the answer was "we don't give earplugs on night flights". Never heard that before. The Return flight was exactly the same.

### Gulf Air customer review
Outbound flight from LHR to BAH was excellent good service and good food/drink. The second stage from BAH to BKK was far from good with unresponsive staff and poor quality food. The return journey from BKK to BAH was once again let down by the staff attitude toward the customer however once again the second part of the flight from BAH to LHR was much better with the exception of the headrest TVs which seemed to work when they felt like. Toilets were blocked from the outset of the journey however the general feeling was that is was ok considering the very reasonable fares offered against their competitors.

DXB-BAH-LHR. The plane was old and rough around the edges. The crew were just going through the motions and there was no attempt in even the most basic customer service except for one flight attendant who was clearly new. She was the only one who smiled and was eager to please. Food was good - a pleasant surprise. Inflight entertainment needs a major overhaul. My luggage and I arrived in one piece which I guess is the most important thing.

### Gulf Air customer review
Flew BAH-MNL the cabin was tired and old looking. The protector hiding the life vest was on the floor and clearly broken a couple of times during the flight the life vest fell on the floor. This is a serious safety issue as its clear the cabin has not been maintained in any shape or form. Another safety issue I'm sure is that all the windows should have the blinds up when landing and taking off but in the area I was seated many were still down when taking off! IFE is awful with only few selected movies and nothing on demand. Food was quite good though and cabin attendants pretty good at answering passengers needs.

I wish I had seen these reviews before travelling Gulf Air. The worst experienced international travel ever. Gulf Air from Bombay to Paris via Bahrain. Our luggage did not arrive in Paris. Not a single staff member in the airport was helpful. They did not give us compensation nor did they help us locate our baggage. After innumerable phone calls and following up we found our baggage 3 days later an hour before we departed for London. The crew was rude and the airline does not care for the customer. While we returned from London to Mumbai via Bahrain our baggage again did not arrive in Mumbai.

A Middle Eastern Airline with little Middle Eastern values! Flew them from LHR to DXB. Check in staff treat you as a number no smile no good evening sir nothing. My flight was delayed but that could happen to any airline but once in the air TV and entertainment did not work for over 1 hour into the flight due to tech issues! Food was poor quality and nearly all the choices I wanted they did not have. I will never use Gulf Air again!

After reading all the negative reviews about Gulf Air thought oh no here we go but I was pleasantly surprised. A330 from BKK to LHR (via Bahrain) all flights on time slightly larger seats as they are still flying the older A330 (which they are upgrading in August this year). Staff friendly and helpful plane was clean food was ok but not on a par with Emirates or Qatar. Entertainment system is old but all working all in all a good flight and at £200 cheaper than any of its competitors you get what you pay for will fly them again based on price and service.

GF150 BAH-BKK 30 Jan 2013 in economy. Pleasant crews. Meal - quality is not good when compared with other airlines in the region. Could not touch the salad and dessert no ideas what they were. Luckily it is just a 6 hours flight. Simple breakfast was served - a cup of yoghurt a piece of bread and coffee/tea. Seat - very comfortable. Entertainment program - very limited choice. Movie selection is out of date. Overall - if considering it is a 3-star airline it is good value for money.

GF002 (LHR-BAH) connecting to GF512 (BAH-DXB) in Falcon Gold. From LHR we were greeted by name orange juice and hot towel and then order taken for drink after takeoff. One Bombay Sapphire and Tonic and one Champagne please! Push back on time. Old A330-200 and the second cabin in FG had not been refurbished and most of the seats had problems with electric's but they still fully reclined and were comfy and roomy. Old IFE but DVD players offered. Very good food selection together with good wine choice. Service from the FA's was first class pity the aircraft wasn't although the purser advised that it was due for seat upgrade mid 2014. On time arrival a very good flight. An hour in the FG lounge in BAH and then onto our second sector to DXB this time on a new A320 with latest IFE. Although a short flight there was a hot snack and full bar service. On time arrival in DXB together with our luggage from LHR which was a relief. Overall a good flight experience.

Flew RUH-BAH-LHR on 23 Jan 2014. Both sectors quite full and the flight RUH-BAH was on time and uneventful basic snack for such a short sector seats in economy not overly generous with space but sufficient. I then had a long lay-over in BAH before boarding my flight to LHR which give me time for shopping at the airport! The next sector was comfortable except for a couple of ladies sat behind me kicking the back of my seat as they were trying to move family all over the cabin. in addition I found these same ladies to be quite selfish with the passengers behind them insisting on reclining their seats while the meal service was on. I was pleased thought to see the GF Cabin Crew to take control of both situations in a pleasant but firm way and eventually the ladies calmed down. The flight itself was pleasant and fro an economy product the food both super and breakfast and entertainment was excellent. The crew made me feel comfortable and the offer of refreshments were plenty. I even managed to get a few hours’ sleep on the flight which left me refreshed when I arrived at LHR. One minor irritation was when we arrived we had to wait over 40 minutes for our baggage to be delivered to the belt. I cannot wait to experience the return flight but before that I have family to catch up with!

I'm usually a fan of Gulf Air but my latest experience with them was simply horrible. Cairo to Doha via Bahrain. Flight from Cairo to Bahrain was on A321 full flight with not one free seat. Food as usual was great (in my opinion Gulf Air's food is far superior to the food of Qatar or Emirates). However the nightmare began during transit in Bahrain. The flight to Doha was delayed 2 hours. Not one announcement was made on the reason of the delay. Airport staff in Bahrain were both rude and clueless. On the flight itself to Doha the Bahraini male flight attendants were rude and sarcastic when asked about the delay. Only water was offered to the passengers comparable to low cost airlines which Gulf Air is supposedly not. This airline is going downhill fairly quickly. Also their IFE needs an Einstein to figure it and the entertainment is very old and limited.

BAH-MNL and still the IFE is very poor and when will it be on demand with up to date films? Lucky that we had a DVD type player as that was a godsend to have as at least it had up to date movies but battery life was not too good for a long flight. Food pretty good this time around as it seems to depend on the on-board chef as they do differ on the flights I have been on previously. Again one of the toilets was out of order which is pretty poor when this flight was completely full! Also seems that the plane was not fully cleaned beforehand as I found litter from the last flight under my seat.

DOH-BAH-BOM. Aircraft's were less two years old good seating generous allowance of 45 kgs in economy! Only downside was very limited portion of meals and limited entertainment.

Following my comments of 13 September 2013 which were 'pre-flight comments' in relation to my GF planned Business Flight; RUH-BAH-LHR-BAH-RUH on 24 Sept and 2 Oct respectively I was pleasantly surprised! Though my ticket RUH-BAH was economy the crew looked after me very well. On arrival at the GF Lounge in BAH my seat was immediately changed to 1G. Likewise on check-in for the LHR-BAH on 2 Oct my allocated seat was 2A. These front 'lie flat' seats are the old GF 1st Class product. The service on all four sectors was very good and the food on the BAH-LHR-BAH was excellent! A good choice of IFE with very attentive Cabin Crew who could do enough for me. I will definitely be flying GF again.

From MCT to BOM then back BOM-MCT. I must say that the entertainment wasn't good at all. The food from MCT-BAH was not very special it was a small sandwich which I think is very good for a 1 hr 20 min flight (in Europe you wont get a meal but drinks only if lucky). The connection times were very bad we arrived in Manama at around 0 am and had to catch the next flight at 10 am and we would have to sleep on the floor. The Crew were very nice nothing to complain about. The flight to Bombay was really nice the meal was a nice Chicken tikka but we could choose from vegetarian to beef to chicken.

Flew BAH-MNL and still the IFE is not on demand but at least you get a DVD type player with selected movies. But does not compare to the likes of Qatar Emirates. Food seems to be below average or maybe down to the caterer at this destination as I did not eat must of mine. Crew were very pleasant and very helpful. Toilets seemed not to be cleaned regularly during the flight as tissues and smells were evident of the previous passenger lying around on the floor.

BAH-AUH on 2 October. A320 in very good shape - updated interior. Flight departed 10 minutes early for the 55 minute flight to Abu Dhabi. Friendly flight attendants in nice attire - 2 male and 2 female. In-flight Entertainment was great - more choices on this A320 for Gulf flights than on United for 12 hour international flights. Even a chicken sandwich and drink were served. Arrived 5 minutes early and baggage was out quickly. Gulf Air is doing a great job!

This report will be published as it is before I take my trip with GF (I will follow up with a review post trip). GF changed from a 3 class airline to a 2 class airline some four years or so. I am flying RUH-BAH-LHR-BAH-RUH on 24 Sept and 2 Oct. I have used miles to upgrade and after reviewing the config of the A332 have just called the call centre to request a seat on row 1 or 2 on the BAH-LHR-BAH sectors as these are 'lie flat'. I was told I could not as these are reserved for 'J' Class passengers only; hence still a 3 class airline! The scores shown are pre flight and my feelings/dealings with the GF staff thus far.

LHR-BAH-BKK return. All flights on time. Quick and hassle free boarding at all airports. Online Check-In worked well (something that Etihad can't seem to manage). A330 aircraft on all sectors. Older aircraft but more spacious and comfortable seats than the flights operated by Emirates Etihad or Qatar. Food was fine and plenty drinks choices with regular juice and water service. Excellent Cabin Crew. Only downside was the poor IFE compared to the competition so take a ipod and a book. Very nice service through Bahrain which is in my opinion a much better transit airport than Dubai Abu Dhabi or Doha. I was pleasantly surprised with Gulf Air and I'll use them again.

### Gulf Air customer review
COK-BAH-LHR. Food was ok and what we did not like and had a major issue with was that my 2 year old daughter was hungry during the Bahrain to London flight and the flight crew informed us that they had run out of milk. We carried 2 bottles of milk from BAH airport and we expected that milk would be available on board like any other parent flying with small children.

### Gulf Air customer review
Dubai to London Heathrow return via Bahrain in both directions. Airbus A320 on the DXB-BAH sectors and larger Airbus A330 on the Bahrain London segments. Faultless service from Gulf Air from the point of checking in at Dubai to arriving back in Dubai 10 days later. The cabin crew really do make this airline special. What it lacks in new aircraft super IFE and gadgets and gizmos is more than compensated for by the crew who give excellent customer service. All cabins lightly loaded in all sectors. I managed to get row 8 on the two longer flights and had no one sitting next to me. Therefore masses of leg and elbow room. Onboard chef a nice touch. Could not fault the catering. If I had to grumble about anything it's possibly the slow service on the Bahrain to London sector where the same crew start serving at Row 1. So it took a while to reach Row 8. Not to worry: a flight attendant kept my glass of Laurent Perrier champagne filled up throughout and replenished the bowl of hot nuts several times without the need to be prompted. Lounges at Bahrain and London superb the latter offering an amazing view out of Terminal 4 across the entire Heathrow campus. Staff were polite and efficient. All in all flying on Gulf Air reminded me of visiting an old Auntie who was determined to make sure that I was fed and watered until I was about to burst! In fact it was nice to be treated nice and to escape from the technology that features so much on other airlines these days.

### Gulf Air customer review
DXB-BAH-LHR-BAH-DXB. All flights on time (OTP) in Business class meal service was excellent. On both sectors brand new aircraft. DXB-BAH-LHR-BAH-DXB service was operated by A330. Had tons of legroom with international configuration. Free flow of snacks and drinks throughout. Breakfast was quite good to windup the trip. Entertainment options quite limited compared to other international flights.

### Gulf Air customer review
BKK-BAH-AMM. Unfortunately I had the "pleasure" to be re-routed by Etihad on this airline as their BKK departure was late and there was no more connection to AMM on the same day. Alas from Etihad to Gulf Air is quite a downgrade. BKK-BAH on an ageing A330. I had to change seats 4 times until I finally found one that was not broken and/or had a seat belt. Luckily the plane was quite empty so I could move around until I finally found a seat in 'working condition'. The IFE was poor limited selections of movie all of them quite out of date. Food was terrible - totally bland. Crew unfriendly never smiling. Another airline which I can add to my private blacklist.

### Gulf Air customer review
LHR-BAH-DOH return. Flights were on time in both directions. A330 from LHR-BAH in need of refurbishment the IFE is incredibly poor and the seats feel like ironing boards! The A320s used on the BAH-DOH route are in contrast brand new comfortable and have modern IFE. The food is fine but I found some of the crew to be surly and unfriendly. Gulf are poor in comparison to other carriers on this route but their fares are competitive.

### Gulf Air customer review
Flew DEL-BAH-PAR and return LON-BAH-DEL. Hostess would not answer on being called. I called 3 times and they came and shut the alert and did not answer once. I asked for a blanket again no response. Food quality was average and the menu was very limited. It was a 3.5 hrs flight STD 21.35 hr and the crew took more than 1.5 hrs to start serving dinner i.e. they served dinner at 23.00 hrs which is past dinner time. By this time passengers had started asking for dinner which again the crew failed to serve promptly. Cabin crew were lax and casual in their attitude and at times discourteous. The inflight entertainment was not only limited but also repetitive. We had the same set of programs on all 4 flights. An experience I would rather forget.

### Gulf Air customer review
Flew Paris-Bahrain-Mumbai and back. Pretty average flight and service. Had a 17 hour stop over at Bahrain. The airport does not have a lot to offer. Contacted customer services several weeks prior to the flight to ask for a transit hotel in Bahrain (mentioned on their website). They were quite rude and I did not get an answer to my request.

### Gulf Air customer review
BAH-LHR-BAH. The major issue I had encountered was with poor air conditioning. The entertainment provided was limited. The food was good and staff amicable!. I wouldn't hesitate to fly with Gulf Air again as long as they're going to upgrade their ageing A330s.

### Gulf Air customer review
My wife and I flew on BAH-FRA-BAH on a new A320 business class helpful and friendly crew smiling all the time. I liked the full flat seats very comfortable food is normal taste good but what they offered us was only a small portion. Inflight entertainment system is good but the touch screen very slow with good selection of movies and TV shows but not brand new shows. It was in general a very good experience and I will use again.

### Gulf Air customer review
The actual flights were satisfactory with good food and service although I agree with other comments about the rather shabby seats and average IFE. However our booking experience was horrendous. In October we booked a flight to Sri Lanka for 3 weeks returning on an evening flight (7pm) from Colombo on 22 Dec. On 3 Dec our agent advised us of a change to our return flight which would involve us arriving in Bahrain at 07.40 on 23 Jan and leaving there on 24 Jan at 02.00 - no offer of hotel. After protest this was changed to another flight leaving Colombo at 04.45 on 22 Jan. This meant we would lose a day of our holiday. After another protest this was changed (on 6 Dec) to the same time but on 24 Jan now 2 days more than planned. Finally on 3 Jan we received yet another email changing our return flight offering us to either return on 22 (as previously suggested) in the early morning flight or on 25 on the same flight. We now had a choice of losing 2 days or gaining 2 days and had no time to reply as taxi was waiting (and hotels etc were already booked). We had to sort this out at Heathrow where they were very helpful and we finally agreed to return on 25 Jan 3 days later than the original plan. All these changes were attributed to cancellations by Gulf Air. We frequently tried to contact them by phone but without success. We thought at first it was an excuse from our agent but have since discovered that Gulf Air had cancelled several flights the previous month. I shall certainly never fly with them again. I would rather pay extra for a reliable company.

### Gulf Air customer review
Flew on DXB-BAH-BKK sector and return. It was my first time with GF and the food was superb. The IFE needs updating though but I felt there was enough for all sectors. Cabin staff were attentive and the Asian cabin crew very friendly transit is a breeze at Bahrain Airport. I would definitely fly this airline again!

### Gulf Air customer review
AMM-BAH-MCT in business class. The flight attendants were friendly and helpful the seats comfortable for these 2 short flights and the meals were quite tasty too. The leg from BAH-MCT was in a fairly old plane and the seats were showing signs of wear. The lounge in Bahrain airport was comfortable and spacious though they don't give announcements for flights so you just have to make your way down to the gate at about the right time (which for us was always too early). The IFE system is the only major drawback but we only had short flights so it wasn't a major issue.

### Gulf Air customer review
LHR-Bahrain-Muscat return. All flights left and arrived on time. A multicultural crew gave friendly service in both directions and meals were quite decent for economy class. Seat backs and headrests on A330 however were hard and uncomfortable without a pillow and something I found unacceptable was that 2 of 4 toilets in the economy class cabin were out of service in both directions. On LHR-Bahrain sector a drinks service was offered right after take-off and nothing until we were over Turkey by which time the one and only meal was served. Flight attendants came around occasionally with trays of juice or water. Inflight entertainment is on a loop system which some will find antiquated but I actually didn't mind as it allows you to watch several things at a time. Bahrain-Muscat was on a very comfortable Embraer aircraft with light meal service and a more limited in-seat entertainment system. Can't compare them to other gulf carriers but I found them good overall and would fly again.

YYZ-LHR-BAH-DAC-BAH-LHR-YYZ. Good timely service. Ground staff very helpful generally. Inflight service good. Meals decent. No complaints overall for the fare. Will travel again Gulf Air in the future.

### Gulf Air customer review
MNL-BAH-DMM. Flight was full boarding was smooth given the amount of passengers going boarding the A330. Seats are ok rather hard and uncomfortable at times on the neck. IFE not on demand although are in seat. Movies are on loop no choice at all and screens are small. Food sub standard although they serve 3 choices - usually out by the time they reach the back area. Service is slow. Cabin crew not smiling and are always in a hurry they disappeared after the meals were served. Only one round of drinks given. Garbage on the floor and crew did not bother to pick them up. Boarding in Bahrain is chaotic but was given a business class seat on A320. Food served on the ground and it was tasty and good on a 20 minute flight. FA's are great!

### Gulf Air customer review
BAH-MNL. Lucky to find that Business class had these flat bed seats installed so had a good rest on the flight. Food was average but the biggest letdown was the IFE system! Gulf Air really need to get updated movies onboard as the films are at least 5yrs old and not on demand like everything was. This is letting the inflight experience down big time.

### Gulf Air customer review
KUW-BHR-LHR return. Went Gulf Air as they were offering some very competitive Business Class fares. The Kuwait to Bahrain short haul was great the new seats were in place and were suitably luxurious and the food excellent for a 45 minute flight. Bahrain to LHR was satisfactory but the cabin has not yet been refurbished so it was pretty old school and the IFE was moderate (hand held). Nevertheless it was a comfortable flight with excellent food good lounges and all arrivals were on time. I'd go again given the keen pricing but on the London route it still lags behind in terms of overall experience due to the old cabin.

### Gulf Air customer review
LHR to DXB return. What was great is that both the outgoing and returning flights all left on time. The service throughout was great. The food was good especially with the re introduction of offering 3 options. I was disappointed with the IFE as I thought Skyhub was available on GF flights only to find out it is yet to be rolled out. Overall I thought the flight was good. I was given extra legroom seat on asking and from there on it was all positive.

### Gulf Air customer review
CMB-BAH-AMM on 19th Oct 2012. Flight from CMB was over 2 hours late due to the late arrival of the aircraft. As a result I missed my flight on the BAH-AMM sector. However ground staff were organised in spite of irate passengers. I was offered a flight later that day as well as hotel accommodation. I declined the hotel as there was only 6 hrs until my flight so was offered breakfast and lunch vouchers. It meant I had to pay extra for airport pickup at AMM.

### Gulf Air customer review
LHR to DXB. Flight left on time and it was a fairly cheap ticket. However the films need updating as they are very old films. Also the films are on loop not on demand. Only one drinks run for the whole flight to Bahrain which I thought was poor. The connection in Bahrain to Dubai was painless even though we only had 40 minutes.

### Gulf Air customer review
LHR-BAH-KWI-BAH-LHR. Flight was on time good service considering the price. No issues. Staff helpful with changing my flights (in London) from Kuwait due to issue with the airline changing the flight departure timings from Kuwait. Service on board was good when compared to the price paid for the ticket. Will fly again for the price.

Bahrain-Dubai Dubai-Amman return to Bahrain. Excellent flight and the staff were nice. Food and service very good. Informative announcements and on each flight we departed on time and arrived on time. All in all a good experience.

### Gulf Air customer review
Amman to Doha via Bahrain. Both flights on time. There were 3 hot meal selections on the Amman to Bahrain sector. I chose an excellent and filling vegetable and rice dish. The crew were smiling and professional. Entertainment system has improved tremendously with a huge selection of movies TV shows games etc. Transit at Bahrain airport was a breeze. Bahrain airport is one of the best airports in the Gulf easy to navigate passenger-friendly good duty free and a good selection of food outlets. Service seems to have improved recently and I would fly them again without hesitation.

### Gulf Air customer review
KWI-BAH return: took this flight as a connection to the BA flight at BAH: both flights Airbus 320 departed and arrived on time: security at Bahrain easy to negotiate so no hassle with the connection. The aircraft was clean the flight smooth. The only small niggles were that the catering was just a sandwich in a paper bag but OK it is only a 45 minute flight; that the cabin crew seemed to be "going through the motions" with the safety demo; and that although I was once given a seat at the emergency exit none of the cabin crew briefed me about the operation of the exit door unlike other airlines where this was a specific item in the cabin checklist. However as a flight on a regional airline it was a good experience.

### Gulf Air customer review
KBL-BAH-FRA in Y class. Excellent in-flight service especially for the price. Layover at BAH made very tolerable by the operation of the "Irish Lounge. On board drinks repeatedly offered food very tasty and IFE quite good. I was worried that the A320 that GF deploys on the BAH-FRA leg might be cramped but GF has reconfigured some of its A320s for longer-haul flights so the Y-class seating was sufficiently spacious; indeed it was quite comfortable. Check-in at KBL the usual chaos but that is not GF's fault. I confidently recommend.

### Gulf Air customer review
From my experience Gulf Air has cheaper than average flights - especially when flying out of LHR. That's where I began my journey changing planes in Bahrain and on to Bangkok. Here's the deal: planes seemed fine - in good condition food and flight attendants were decent. The problem is disorganization odd- functioning website and weird schedules. Many connecting flights have extended layovers in Bahrain. The airport has nothing to do and is small crowded and dirty. Not to mention on my return flight the airline just nonchalantly canceled the their only flight out of Bangkok for two days because of a "schedule change. The risk of not making your destination on this airline is too big spring for a couple extra bucks on British Airways or one of GA's Middle Eastern competitors.

### Gulf Air customer review
J class BAH-BOM return. Check in a breeze pleasant staff through business security in seconds. Lounge very good vast array of food and beverages fast high speed wifi lounge spotless and very modern. Staff onboard were pleasant 8 seats full in Business menu option not available no menus no wine list not a great selection of avod. Landed ahead of schedule fast track immigration bags off promptly. On the return check in a breeze I had left my Ipod on board on the outbound flight and it was there at the check in desk when I arrived. Immigration priority lane security is a nightmare in Mumbai with constant checking and rechecking of bags re-tagging them rechecking boarding cards. They use the airport lounge clipper dark dingy no alcohol food is very poor. Flight on time crew pleasant if not robotic few smiles. Menus offered good wines and food. AVOD the same as the way out landed early private bus from aircraft for business pax but bags of last. Overall Gulf are trying hard and will use again.

### Gulf Air customer review
LHR to Kabul return. Outbound excellent check-in and very impressive Gulf Air lounge. Onboard A330 seating was ok but short of offerings by their Gulf based competitors. A good menu available well presented and tasty with a good selection of wines and other beverages. Rather than the installed IFE C class passengers were given standalone equipment which had a fair range of viewing options. Transit in Bahrain was fine lounge had a great view over the apron and friendly staff but furnishings very tired and early morning food offerings not the best. Connecting flight on A320 C class had 2-2 configuration. Meal served was fair alcoholic drinks only available on request. Return was a sharp contrast - flight cancelled and no help at airport. Finally booked to fly 4 days late. Check-in the usual chaos with no dedicated C class line. Once through the plane did not appear for several hours. Information very poor left in the lounge for several hours. Finally the plane landed departure delayed until the next morning. Baggage not returned and people left to fend for themselves. Eventually we flew with no proper meal. Red eye flight to London on A340 offered the best seat/cabin served light evening snacks which were tasty and an average breakfast. On arrival in LHR 4 days late I had to wait over an hour for my bag. Overall I accept I was unlucky but would probably not take this route again if I could avoid it.

### Gulf Air customer review
LHR-BAH. Airbus A340. Service is usually good equipment new check-in a breeze. I think this was a relatively old interior judging by the low quality screen. The seats in economy were terrible neither I nor the angry woman behind me could get comfortable because our knees were pressed against the reclining seat in front. I had an aisle seat - 22c and was struck painfully on the knee by a trolley woken frequently by having my shoulder knocked by stewardesses water tipped on me from a food tray being passed over no apology or explanation. By the end of the flight I felt that I had been through an assault course.

### Gulf Air customer review
COK-BAH-MCT. COK-BAH in Business Class; one of the smiling Gulf Air staff filled the necessary immigration form on behalf of me and escorted me up to the Immigration counter. It was a pleasure travelling on a relatively new A321 aircraft with plenty of seat pitch together with the efficient crew. Breakfast was good. Once again a minus point that there was no amenities in the Business Class Toilet not even hand-wash soap. BAH-MCT sector was supposed to be in Economy Class but to my surprise while boarding an Embraer 170 aircraft at Bahrain the Falcon Gold flight attendant just pulled me back saying "you have been given Seat 3F" instead of pre-assigned 14A seat. The meal provided in this sector was tasty.

### Gulf Air customer review
Flew MCT-BAH-COK in Business Class (Seat 2A). MCT-BAH on Embraer 19 aircraft on time with tasty light meals and the crew very active. Used Falcon Gold Lounge at Bahrain. Plenty of food and beverages available for self-service. BAH-COK an A320 aircraft in Business Class (Seat 1A). Good choice of food and beverages with cabin crew performing their duty well but the dis-advantage is the lack of amenities in the lavatory where only toilet tissues only available. On request crew provided a toothbrush and paste. Other than that the 3.5 hour flight was enjoyable and landed early at COK. Will fly again with Gulf Air.

### Gulf Air customer review
DOH-BAH return both legs on new A320 as always service is very good departure and arrival were on time. No meals were give due to the very short trip (25 minutes).

LHR-BAH BAH-MNL return. LHR-BAH: Late to check-in online so was stuck in the middle 4 seats. My tray table kept falling down the locking mechanism had broken and was held up by duct tape. BAH-MNL: Aircraft was newer with better seats entertainment and food. I was pleased with the overall flight. MNL-BAH: an average flight. The food was okay but not to everyone's liking. On the bright side I was able to get three 15 minute Wi-Fi cards for the aircraft's wireless Internet connection. After waiting 8 hours at BAH we boarded BAH-LHR flight on an older A330-200. It didn't include Wi-Fi nor did it include live television. Food wasn't too impressive although the flight attendants were able to 'silence' crying babies with ease. It's a bit hit-and- miss with Gulf Air. I would have given the airline a higher rating if they supply Europe with their newer fleet of A330-200s.

### Gulf Air customer review
MAA-BAH-FRA. All flights on time. Economy class but was upgraded to business class from MAA-BAH. Business class meal service was excellent. On both sectors brand new aircraft. BAH-FRA service was operated by PrivatAir on B737-700. Had ample legroom due to exit row. Free flow of snacks and drinks throughout. Breakfast adequate and filling. AVOD on both sectors but compared to competitors entertainment options quite limited.

### Gulf Air customer review
London Heathrow-Bangkok via Bahrain return. All 4 flights were very good. Helpful cabin crew. Planes outbound were old and the entertainment slightly lacking. Return flights were newer planes and the entertainment fantastic. Meals pretty standard nothing to rave about. Would definitely fly Gulf Air again.

Flew from Copenhagen to Mumbai - a very pleasant experience. Aircraft was modern and clean with good leg room. Food was nice and staff very helpful. We had the same experience on our return except that we then were given seats in business class from Mumbai to Bahrain. Next time I will not hesitate using Gulf Air.

Overall mixed trip London Heathrow-Abu Dhabi via Bahrain. First flight on ageing A330 A bit shabby but otherwise clean. Food tasteless and I could not eat all of it it was a night flight so I slept most of the way and the entertainment was nothing to shout about. Connection to Abu Dhabi was ok but Gulf Air changed the plane to an ageing A319. The snack offered was horrible. Return connection to Bahrain a completely different story. Very new and clean Embraer E-190. Inflight entertainment was brilliant with plenty of choice. Breakfast was very tasty. Return flight was much the same with the food not very nice and the entertainment not great. I think I will be sticking to British Airways next time.

BEY-BAH-MAA. A pleasant surprise overall A320 in excellent condition on both legs. Catering between average (per ME standards) and mediocre in quality crew definitely not motivated some very stressed. Both flights departed and arrived on time. The service is not a bliss but being cheaper than lowcost's on this leg makes them definitely value for money and under those conditions I would fly them again.

### Gulf Air customer review
LHR-BAH in Falcon Gold. Old A340-600. Boarded on time but error in Pax numbers resulted in 30 minute delay and much frustration for many with tight connections. Aircraft showing its age with worn seating and no AVOD but cabin service was excellent with Chef providing really good food accompanied by a decent wine list. Whilst the A340 is an old bird it still gives a smooth a quiet flight but the sooner Gulf update their Falcon Gold cabins the better.

### Gulf Air customer review
Economy: LHR-BKK return. Very hard to give a balanced review as each flight in the four parts was like flying different airlines. The service levels varied so much. Food very good on all legs. Transfer in Bahrain 10/10 great little airport and no buses. Flight attendants: from the gum chewing lady who loudly told her co-worker she didn't like speaking German to the girls that though it funny that they where too busy to get into position and could only point to one exit door during the safety video. Contrast this to the crew on the last leg home who without doubt could have been from any of the top performing airlines in the world. Would I fly Gulf again? At their low prices hard not to Just don't expect to much and then if your lucky your expectations might just be exceeded if your lucky! Entertainment can't review as broken on all legs - says it all really.

### Gulf Air customer review
DOH-LHR via Bahrain. Outbound flight was delayed 2 hours coming from JED. As usual cabin crew very active and helpful haven't seen the Sky Hub onboard yet on both ways. Presentation of meals was very good Gulf Air Lounge in LHR is nice with an average amount of food and drinks. GF needs to reschedule the connection flights times to DOH since they are rescheduling their flight times to Europe.

FRA to KUL via BAH. Outbound flight was very good and left on time. Seats were spacious food was good and staff friendly and present in the cabin a lot. Bahrain to Kuala Lumpur flight was delayed but again the flight was good and staff great. The only downside was the 6 hour stop over in Bahrain and the inflight entertainment was pretty basic but worked and had a choice of a few movies. Definitely value for money.

London Heathrow to Bahrain 8th Dec 2011 at 21.50. Cabin dirty headset didn't work no inflight entertainment and staff terse. Third time in the last year I have travelled with Gulf Air and usually very good but this was poor.

KUL-BAH-CDG return on the 330 for all segments. Excellent value for money! FA's professional friendly and hospitable. The food was appetizing with a wide variety of options. What remains for Gulf Air is simply to replace their aircraft's with new ones and their rating will definitely improve.

### Gulf Air customer review
IFE was a relatively short loop of programs on 10+ channels with moving map forward and ground cam view. The channels repeated themselves 3 times during a 7 hr flight and were the same in both directions. During the last 45 mins before landing the IFE shows adverts over and over again. This gets quite frustrating when you are on a few Gulf flights - one after the other. Food and service was very good with warm bread and tasty food (not served in a foil tray).

### Gulf Air customer review
London to Sri Lanka via Bahrain return. Very poor service inflight entertainment even worse and mine didn't work at all on all legs of trip. Food disappointing and lack of drinks served be they alcoholic or non-alcoholic. Plus side flights went out on time and arrived on time. Shabby aircraft on the interior. General all round disappointment and will not travel on them again unless there is no other option.

### Gulf Air customer review
Doha-Bahrain-Bangkok return. Was shocked what poor condition the aircraft was in. Outbound my partners seat wouldn't stay upright so kept reclining back the whole trip. The TV monitors weren't working in our whole section. On the BKK to Doha return again the plane was in poor condition and while the TV monitors kind of worked the speakers didn't so once again we were staring at the seat for 7 hours. I saved money flying them but next time I would rather spend more money and fly a better airline.

### Gulf Air customer review
LHR-BAH-KUL Lounge at LHR very nice good food and service. Not so good once I got onboard. In the back bit of Business which is more Premium Economy than business. First seat didn't work so I moved (only 4 in cabin) and the second seat stopped working. AVOD very poor quality and choice. On check-in I'd been warned that refurb work at BAH meant they were using a temporary lounge. They were using the quite basic Cathay lounge instead which was crowded and poor. For the leg to KUL I was bumped up to the front row decent seat and more attentive service. Handed out personal media players but still a limited choice. Food good on both legs but drinks service a bit slow and forgetful.

### Gulf Air customer review
Got bumped at Bahrain during a TRV-ABQ itinerary had to stay overnight which meant I missed the connection in NYC to ABQ. They put me up in Bahrain but no compensation at all was given for one whole day of delay. Also extremely rude and unprofessional personnel. They are probably made that way by dealing with lots of unsatisfied customers.

Milano Malpensa to Bahrain in Economy and Business on the return to Italy. Both cabins very clean crew extremely professional good seats in Economy - I could easily sleep. Old but comfortable seats in Business. Good quality of food in both cabins and entertainment with several movies (in Italian too) music and video games. I would fly again.

### Gulf Air customer review
After having bought a Milan-Bangkok return Economy class for myself and my partner once at the Malpensa airport I decided to buy a Business Class upgrade. Business Class was made of old fashion seats just a bit larger with a pathetic foot rest that did not even fully extend. We chose to fly Economy on the return due to upgrade problems. The plane from Bangkok to Bahrain seemed to be old with poor maintenance seats rows close and the seats have a poor reclining angle. Bahrain to Milan was even worse - it had only 2 toilets for the entire Economy Class they played percussion music during the entire night flight and every now and then the entire light system would go into a strobe effect that lasted several minutes.

### Gulf Air customer review
CAI-BAH-MCT checked-in 24 hrs before my flight. First leg onboard A330 spacious comfortable and clean. Upgraded to Business Class meant an enjoyable first leg with attentive crew. Flight to Muscat on a pretty new Embraer E190 tight seats are comfortable food is ok during takeoff the AC kept dropping water on me. Worth the price.

### Gulf Air customer review
Frankfurt to Bahrain Bahrain to Kathmandu return. Economy class inflight entertainment system was limited and old fashioned. Blurry monitor and old remote with limited options.

CPH-BAH-BKK. The airline is new to Copenhagen; thus they have been selling promotional tickets. First leg was an A321 operated by Privatair but dressed in Gulf Air colours. Aircraft only 25% full. Service was excellent: 3 meal options (in fact reduced to two due to low loading of passengers). Free and constant flow of drinks if asked for one was mostly offered two. Wines of lower quality only tolerable. Very good service excellent IFE lots of movies. BAH-BKK: A330. Noisy plane 75% full but still nice caring service. Good food 3 options again. I rejected the red wine and the FA brought me a glass of a much better wine from the Business Class section. In the morning they let me sleep instead of giving me breakfast which I was pleased with.

LHR-BAH-KTM. Nice trip with no delays. Food was ok from LHR-BAH with some western style dishes. To KTM food was more Asian which was nice with plenty of drinks rounds. When asked for more legroom I got an upgrade to Business class. BAH aircraft was A330 which looked nice and new. To KTM we flew an A340 which was tired and worn out.

KBL-BAH-CDG-BOS (code share w/AA) and BOS (code share w/AA) LHR-BAH-KBL. In short GF offers and delivers excellent value for money. On the flight from Kabul to BAH the Arabic lamb stew and tabuleh salad were nothing short of excellent and the full open bar service is generous as nearly unlimited rounds are offered. Transiting BAH is very easy and GF's arrangement with Aeroports de Paris is such that it is assigned gates at CDG that are immediately adjacent to its code-share partner AA so that transit experience is seamless as well. At LHR a change of terminal is required but ground personnel are very helpful. All in all a very good travel experience with Gulf Air.

LHR-BAH BAH-CMB. First leg on A330 not bad service. Crew worked hard and were very polite. Did not have food so cannot comment on taste. Lady sitting next to me had about 3 pieces of baggage with her. And she held onto it during the course of the flight. Entertainment not the latest. 2nd leg on A320 again very hardworking crew. I found crew were pleasant and ready to help. Food was poor and bland on this sector. Plenty of juice rounds which was nice but entertainment was old. All flights on time.

### Gulf Air customer review
DOH-BAH-MXP return in May excellent cabin crew quality of food was also good (quantity is not) portable entertainment system which worked fine but without to many options both legs departures and arrivals were on time. Falcon Gold Lounge in Bahrain was a little bed cramped but fine for 2 hours connection flight.

### Gulf Air customer review
Paris-Kuala Lumpur Economy class. One-way fare was the cheapest among airlines for last minute booking as cheap as AirAsiaX. Flight on time check in at CDG quick. Transit at the Bahrain hassle free. Seat quite comfortable passengers were provided with eye mask and socks. Inflight entertainment was OK around 20 video channels on 6.5" LCD screen. Inflight meals was average. Cabin crew quite attentive and friendly.

### Gulf Air customer review
DXB-BAH-LHR. Onboard service adequate between BAH-LHR. IFE A330 outdated and frequently freezing. Been flying regularly with Gulf Air since early nineties. The service has certainly dipped in standards since then. They have a lot of room for improvement if they are to compete with the other carriers of the Gulf. Certainly rank as a 3 star carrier. LHR-BAH-DXB once again service pretty much average no IFE working on whole A330 flight to BAH. Staff were helpful and polite aircraft looking very tired and dilapidated.

### Gulf Air customer review
London to Colombo via Bahrain. The staff were friendly food nothing special beverage selection was good. There was a problem with my seat on the first journey from London to Bahrain and I could not recline which was an annoyance. The entertainment system was not very good - a very old system. On the second journey however I got a free upgrade to Business class the service was very good. They really to cater to every need that you have in business class. The aircraft on first journey was an A330 and a nice aircraft Bahrain to Colombo an A320 very small.

Was supposed to be flying with Gulf Air from Isfahan to London via Bahrain. Gulf cancelled the flight and refused to make alternative arrangements. I won't be flying with them again.

### Gulf Air customer review
ATH-BAH-KUL E190 was new and pleasant with great IFE. A330 was ok with no complaints. Service was good and the food tasty. In the A330 flight the service was adequate even though there was a long time that the staff was disappeared (after lunch till breakfast). I noticed that people were going to the back galley and returning with sandwiches and refreshment. We had a 10 hour stopover in BAH and provided hotel food visa support.

### Gulf Air customer review
CMB-BAH. Arrived in CMB from Heathrow and stayed 7 days on a family holiday planned to fly to BAH on the early flight to be told that my family and myself had our tickets cancelled by Gulf Air - panic began to arrive as on further investigation Gulf had no record of myself and 3 extra passengers travelling. Felt totally abandoned following a visit to Colombo office for the second time - 3 hrs journey each way and a 2 hour wait in the offices. Having to prove that we are Gulf passengers by showing baggage tags and e-tickets - being the annual family holiday left us all drained and very upset.

### Gulf Air customer review
BAH-JED This service is operated by A330-200 in short / medium haul configuration of Business and Economy with old-style arm-chair type seating in Business. The aircraft interior and seating had a tired look and feel about it - the panelling of the seats would appear to have been recently repainted by hand – and badly. IFE is AVOD but with limited choice of viewing. GF makes a big thing of having a chef onboard but in reality the food is standard medium haul Business fare that is reasonably presented but questionable quality. I had lamb steak which was inedible – a sharp knife was not able to cut through the steak. The cabin crew was multi-national as is normal in the Middle East – efficient and professional if not full of the joys of life. This was a 09h40 departure out of BAH supposedly but initially delayed to 10h45 due to the usual ”late arrival of the inbound aircraft”. At 10h45 when on-board we were advised that we would be further delayed until 11h15 whilst we awaited some connecting passengers who had been delayed due to their ”late arrival of the inbound aircraft”. Then we were told that a passenger had fallen ill and that we had to await the arrival of a doctor who eventually pitched up and treated the passenger on-board. That whole process took almost another hour – he was very lucky as most other airlines would have booted the passenger off. We eventually got away at 12h15 2h 35m late. GF used to be the dominant airline in the Gulf but is now up against some stiff local competition and trailing by a good margin.

### Gulf Air customer review
DAM-BAH-KUL. Departure from Damascus on E170 - first time for me on Embraer aircraft and was surprised at the leg room and comfort for Y class. They upgraded me to J Class on the short flight. Arrived Bahrain and given a complimentary stay at the Golden Tulip. Just after midnight transferred back to the airport for 2am flight to Kuala Lumpur. The flight ended up to be 95% full and it was extremely painful to sit on the hard Y seats of their A330-200. Service and meal great. I just wonder why the 2nd meal service for all flight ex-Bahrain is much more appetizing as compared to those flight bound for Bahrain?

### Gulf Air customer review
DXB-BAH-LHR return I bought this flight due to the fairly low price. The flight was awful on the way out really dated aircraft horrible food and I forgot about the old IFE system - felt like I was back in the 1990's! The return flight was okay not so different although this time we had a choice of meals and it was a bit more welcoming also frequent offers of drinks after meal. The cabin crew were good no complaints about them but what a shame for Gulf Air.

### Gulf Air customer review
Kuwait to New Delhi via Bahrain small plane A320 used a bit claustrophobic. Only two crew members completely inadequate. Food was just passable and can be improved. The meal service took more than one hour - some passengers had meal some had to wait to for more than 1 hour. Alcohol was not served for reasons unknown. No inflight entertainment.

### Gulf Air customer review
Gulf Air was rather an unpleasant experience. When we arrived at the gate on Heathrow in transit from Amsterdam to Kathmandu Nepal we were checked in but our luggage was not. This we found out in Kathmandu. Four pieces of luggage - not transported. Because of this bad service we almost missed our expedition to Tibet two days later. Of course we are not happy. We wrote complaint to Gulf Air but we don't get any answer on that. It seems that Gulf Air is not interested. Kathmandu to Bahrein was not pleasant customers were about 98 percent Nepalese and crew was not polite or helpful. The food was terrible also on the flight from Bahrein to London - curry beans with bean salad is not a good meal early morning. Gulf Air - never again!

### Gulf Air customer review
I recently travelled with Gulf Air to/from Sri Lanka. I had read some pretty poor reviews prior to flying and some of them turned out to be true. On two of the flights toilets were blocked or locked. Beware of row 28 on the A320-100/200 these seats do not recline. Although we were at the front of the check-in queue we were allocated these seats.

### Gulf Air customer review
KUL-BAH-DAM with overnight in Bahrain. Flight to Bahrain on A332 which was 70% full so I ended up with 4 seats all to myself. After arrival at 2pm collected my rental car and proceeded to the Golden Tulip for the night. After check in we were advised against going out due to the tense situation. So decided to stay in and watched TV. Next morning drove to the airport and everything was okay. Cabin crew excellent. Meals outstanding though portions were small.

### Gulf Air customer review
FRA-BAH-IFN. FRA-BAH on new A330 BAH-IFN on Embraer 170. Both flights pleasant despite being almost 100% full. I found crew hard-working and friendly (on FRA flights they offered beverages at least 4 times and trays and cups collected regularly). The food on the first flight was excellent and seats were comfortable. Only negative points : the plane was very cold when we boarded it and that didn't improve much during the flight (fortunately they handed out blankets generously) and the IFE system for my seat was not working properly. BAH is a small and convenient airport.

### Gulf Air customer review
Muscat to Colombo via Bahrain economy class. Muscat to Bahrain flight was ok. Bahrain to Colombo flight was very poor quality in cabin staff service. They served the dinner after dinner the cabin crew were very reluctant to collect empty trays. I saw most of the passengers sitting uncomfortably they were unable to move or go to even for toilets.

### Gulf Air customer review
BKK-BAH-LHR. I bought this flight from Bangkok International airport the day before departure I needed to get home fairly quickly so settled for this airline which was a bit of a mistake. The flight was a little late leaving but its rare to depart exactly on time. The plane was old and dirty and seats not very comfortable. I am a very tall guy so I must have extra leg room which they were more than happy to arrange - but there were plenty of spare seats so if your on the ball you can grab a whole row and lay across I was not so lucky the seats were quite narrow too. The food was terrible I couldn't eat half of it as its catered for middle-eastern people. Their prices are good and it shows - if you don't care about food and cleanliness then its fine but I wouldn't fly with them again if I had the choice. The staff were friendly but you rarely see them only to give you food and you don't get any free drinks only with a meal. Bahrain airport is nice and clean with shops and restaurants if you want to eat there (McDonalds etc). Overall a budget international airline.

### Gulf Air customer review
DOH-BAH-CDG return in business class. We got the flat bed seats because we paid the J class fare IFE was old and terrible the food was not good on outbound but much better on the return flight. Seat was okay at best though the width was nice.

### Gulf Air customer review
Islamabad to Cairo Via Bahrain. Flight from Islamabad to Bahrain was full food was insipid. Crew seen only during food serving. Bahrain to Cairo flight was little better service wise and food wise. Same thing on the way back on Dec 31st. this is a below average airline.

### Gulf Air customer review
Does anyone know what's going on with Gulf Air pricing as of late? I complained a few months back that they were raising their prices for Bahrain-Bangkok in Falcon Gold (Business/First) and the response being the smart business people they are in Gulf Air was to raise them up even more! Previously was around 6-700 Dinars return Bahrain-Bangkok. Now it is running 650 Dinars one way! More than 1400 Dinars return. I checked Bahrain to London and it is running 750 Dinars - one way. I thought it might be due to upgrading costs for the Falcon Gold cabin but they are pricing themselves out of the game and still using the same tired A340s maybe spruced up a bit but I don't know as I'm now avoiding Gulf and their price gouging like the plague. Qatar Airways Business class is still reasonable around 6-700 Dinars return if you don't mind the short turn around in Doha between Bahrain and Bangkok. My mate did it last week and said it was good. Anyone have any idea what Gulf Air's twisted business plan is?

### Gulf Air customer review
KUL-BAH-CAI trip outward pretty good A340. Food okay but not the best. Service good. GF need to maintain their seats the entertainment system was broken. Trip back was horrible and disappointing. A340 CAI-BAH delayed 4-5 hours BAH-KUL was seated in middle air conditioning wasn't adequate and hottest plane ever flew! There were not enough blankets for all passengers so they had to increase the heat! Saw one passenger asking for blanket and was turned down nut they were later found in an overhead compartment! Food good with turkey served xmas day. But what's the point when I was boiled up to the point I couldn't even go to sleep and had to walk to the galley to get some air?

### Gulf Air customer review
LHR-BAH 26 December. Skyteam lounge in Terminal 4 is good a little tatty perhaps but the buffet was decent. Self-serve champagne and a decent selection of very cold wines. Flight was pretty ordinary. IFE is poor - half a dozen films on a loop with rubbish image quality so they have started handing out personal media players which are preloaded with a dozen movies and music etc. The standard of service was very good - real care and attention to detail. Food excellent - turkey for Christmas champagne served throughout. Planes are pretty tatty and the prices no better than Emirates or Qatar Airways so even though staff get top marks and the food was good I would never recommend Gulf Air over these two airlines.

### Gulf Air customer review
BEY-BAH-KUL: BEY-BAH dinner was excellent. BAH-KUL FAs did excellent job. Dinner was wonderful and the 2nd meal prior to arrival is far superior to the grilled vegetarian sandwich they served on the way to Bahrain!

### Gulf Air customer review
KUL-BAH-BEY. Things better now that GF has introduced their A332 instead of their ancient A340. Seat pitch is a little bit more generous. The 2nd meal before arrival into BAH was simply disgusting - it seems that nobody wanted their sandwich! The meal to BEY was great. Despite Gulf Air's inconsistent quality I find crew professional and dedicated. Their fares are also an attraction for me.

### Gulf Air customer review
I am a gold card carrying frequent flyer Falcon class. Gulf have clearly decided to dump any premium allegiances by treating business travellers very badly. LHR-DXB no record of (online confirmed) booking bumped from allocated seat on overnight flight to seat with no pitch. BAH- LHR technical problem resulted in a substituted plane which was something out of the 1970's - no apologies terrible seat pitch. Made a formal complaint 2 months ago - heard nothing - Gulf Air have the Ryanair approach to customer service.

### Gulf Air customer review
Kuwait to Bahrain on new A320 . No PTVs but seat and legroom better than average and with a friendly crew made such a short flight a very pleasant experience. The snack box on this sector is adequate. I would fly GF again if it's on their newer equipment considering that Bahrain airport is a fairly easy airport to transit through.

### Gulf Air customer review
KUL-BAH-LHR and back - flights not as bad as I expected it to be. Flight from KUL on an ancient A340 which featured peep holes between two toilets at the back of the aircraft (ex- SQ). Flight was packed and seats carpets and other parts of the overhead cabin were falling apart. BAH to LHR was on a similar aircraft but a shade better. Crew generally pleasant and made up for the shabby aircraft. Transit in BAH is tedious with the security checks even upon arrival before proceeding to transfer desk with no consideration to short transits. Return on LHR to BAH was stated A332 but my worst enemy appeared the A340 - same aircraft then took me to KUL eventually. Crew again very pleasant and friendly food alright but Gulf Air needs to really buck up on their aircraft renewal refurbishing or upgrading at least. They have so much to offer otherwise.

### Gulf Air customer review
Larnaca-Dubai via Bahrain Business class. Gulf Air offers cheap rates compared to with Emirates. The day of departure they suffered a London Heathrow T5 problem with their computer system so my flight was delayed and I had to wait 6 hours in Bahrain for a connecting flight to Dubai. Gulf Air was very good in communicating the delays via SMS. All flights are old style business class but much better than European short or medium haul business class. Service and food was excellent Larnaca to Bahrain average on other flights. Good wine selection. Business Lounge in Bahrain is excellent but I pity the economy passengers who must transit in such poor airport. No security fast track at Bahrain but the security staff is very prompt in screening passenger (not sure that they are very thorough in their safety check though).

### Gulf Air customer review
Paris CDG to Bahrein and back in Economy. On the flight to BAH (daytime) I found that the hot meal was not good (tasteless) and IFE is really outdated with a very limited choice and no information regarding the hours when the film begins. Not confortable but what you expect from Economy. On the way back (at a terrible time 1.30 am) the weaknesses of the old planes are even more obvious. The economy seat seems to have no more foam left on the back mine could not recline the IFE of my colleague was broken (we were on a front seat so it was the folding type) and would not held in position. I was unable to sleep at all but those who were had the pleasure of being waken up by the crew 2.25 hours before landing to serve breakfast! The service itself was quite disorganised and the crew not professinnal. A shame this is the only direct flight form CDG to BAH.

### Gulf Air customer review
KUL-BAH BAH-LHR. Kuala Lumpur to Bahrain was upgraded to Business Class on their ancient A340-300 great with the exception of a broken foot rest. Bahrain to London (on ancient A340-300) was a nightmare as there were infants & kids crying all night. It was such a pain having to tolerate the endless wailing for the duration of the flight on an aircraft that has served its shelf life. Gulf Air seriously needs to upgrade their hardware to complement the effort their cabin crew contribute. The other areas which GF needs to focus is their seat pitch (very tight at 32") and meal quantity.

### Gulf Air customer review
DOH-BAH-FRA return. Gulf Air have old airplanes but well maintained. We boarded late and got the sleeper seats. Old IFE system but choices of movie are good spacious leg room in business cabin very helpful staff and great dining.

### Gulf Air customer review
KUL-BAH-MCT. KUL-BAH flight IFE not that good less choices of movies. Food good but water was not provided on tray on both service. Crew was not attending call bells. The crew who was serving on our side finally came after almost half an hour waiting and I asked her - she replied that she will serve the water with second service. and we waited for more than 45 min for the second service to start. Upon arrival no crew were at the door bidding us goodbye but instead busy packing their stuff. BAH-MCT served a box of snacks and again no water provided.

### Gulf Air customer review
Larnaca-Bahrain-Dubai was the worst flight I have experienced. Delayed 6 hours outbound (BAH- DXB) and delayed 30 hours inbound only for the flight then to be cancelled with no explanation - we got transferred to direct Emirates flight. Outbound the plane was dirty the seat was broken. Also it was obvious to everyone that certain people were smoking in the toilets. This was noticed by two FA's (as they were speaking about it beside me) who proceeded to do absolutely nothing about it!

### Gulf Air customer review
DXB-BAH-BKK in Falcon Gold on an A340 and an A330. Inconsistency is the name of the game with Gulf Air. From a premium cabin point of view Gulf Air has three main problems - its aircraft crew and its catering all range from top notch to very poor. DXB-BAH an old looking A340 featuring an equally old and completely outdated interior - legroom in the former First Class seats in row 1/ 2 seemed quite spacious legroom in the four rows that used to be Business Class is very poor. This is Business Class the way it used to be 15 or 20 years ago. On the 55 min flight to Bahrain a small warm meal was served with beverages. The crew was professional and friendly service. In Bahrain I spent some time enjoying the Business class lounge where plenty of food and Champagne was available. BAH-BKK to Bangkok I had seat 1F in a seat I knew from when it used to be First Class. A330s of Gulf Air feature excellent premium cabins although there are always technical problems with the seats. Seats in row 1 and 2 with plenty of space and privacy. Friendly and professional service was provided by flight attendants. A full dinner service provided with continental breakfast before landing. Meal is nicely set up with no use of trays but food presentation and taste could be improved. While plenty of drinks are provided it would be nice if wine was poured from the bottle in the cabin rather than in the galley. Gulf Air claims that sleeper suits are provided but none appeared on this flight. Gulf Air has work to do in terms of quality and consistency but with competitive fares they remain a good value for money choice.

### Gulf Air customer review
Was booked LHR to BKK but had to cancel due to FCO advice due to violence in Thailand. No refund due to type of fare however Gulf Air are refusing to refund government taxes (£300). Have written to CAA who indicated they are inundated with complaints against this airline. Have tried to call Gulf Air 41 times (8 occasions I got through and once they realised I wanted money from them they hung up) I have actually got recordings of their appalling bad and rude customer service.

### Gulf Air customer review
CDG to BAH return. Booked on Business was put in Falcon Gold which is the former 1st class. The 8 front seats on the A330 although well worn are comfortablek. With the help of the stewardess managed to lay flat during the night flight but took care not to touch anything until breakfast. The maintenance is obviously poor as I was not the only one with this problem. IFE is not to today's standard (limited choice of films and language and you have to wait for the film to begin without knowing when it will). Breakfast good but the meal on the in-flight was definitely not first class and wines were lower range. Crew in this cabin was nice both ways. No bar open between services. All in all not what you expect from 1st class.

### Gulf Air customer review
CAI-BAH-DXB in Y class. Check in at CAI was smooth. Cabin crew seemed generic and left no impression despite a relatively light load. A340 is by now unbearable and I do recommend against flying GF on their A340s. Wonky IFE bad seats shabby interior make for a really bad experience. Catering was quite poor - the main was alright but salad/desert were terrible. No bread or butter to be seen. Cabin did not give each passengers their own soda can which I find disappointing considering the amount of money a ticket costs. Transfer in BAH was smooth and efficient and I would rate the transfer experience ahead of DXB AUH and even DOH. More seating space in BAH than there was a few years ago. Second leg was an A330-200 better interior snack box more worthwhile and friendlier crew. GF really does need to re-motivate its employees and get rid of those A340s. I find QR to be the better airline although it isn't quite value-for-money as GF is.

### Gulf Air customer review
London Heathrow - Bahrain. Flight wasn't full so I found a 3-Seater at the rear end of the A340 and slept. Breakfast was great and attendants professional. Gulf Air needs to replace their aging A340.

### Gulf Air customer review
BKK-BAH-DOH-BAH-BKK. Probably the worst airline I have ever flown on. I appreciate the A340's are old but there is no excuse for not having hand soap in the toilets or having a faucet that is covered with masking tape so the water flows smoothly - left side toilets in front of seat row 33. There is zero cleaning taking place during the flight and the staff sat at the back and talked throughout the flight without offering service or maintaining the cleanliness of the plane. Paper was heaped on the floor in the toilets and there was limited water. Although staff are pleasant they do not seem happy - god knows how they are not embarrassed to work with such a poor quality airline. There also did not seem enough staff on the plane - during the safety presentation we only had one person in our cabin to do the usual safety seatbelts exits lifejacket routine. My headphone jack did not work on the way back and on the way out it was like being in the 1980's with the poor IFE. Thankfully the plane was not full so I had a whole row to myself to sleep. Its hardly surprising the plane was not full - it was one of the most disgusting plane-rides I have taken - definitely not a three-star airline. At Bahrain airport we were delayed one hour on the BHR-BKK trip and the gate was changed from 35 to 32 during the middle of loading.

### Gulf Air customer review
DOH-BAH-DOH delayed for one hour on departure from Doha because the fuel was too hot so they needed to add more fuel to cool it down. I think it is Gulf Air trying to save costs by not refueling in Doha service was average. Outbound flight on A320 the seats were comfortable and the meal was good. Flight attendants friendly inbound flight on time and on A330 very comfortable.

### Gulf Air customer review
Bland would be a good resume. I flew economy from Paris to Bahrein and back. A330 looks far from new inside. The seats are similar to Air France economy ones (in other words okay for very small people) - on the way in there was IFE my headset was not working the replacement neither and I had to use my own. On the return one we were on 1st row had more legroom but had to do without IFE at all! Crew does the basics of the job and service acceptable. Food acceptable for economy. If there was any other solution I would not go back on Gulf Air.

### Gulf Air customer review
Kuala Lumpur - Bahrain and Bahrain- Paris CDG . Gulf Air A340-300 on KUL-BAH flights are dragging them down in their star ranking compared to the more spacious A330-200 on their BAH- CDG flights. The lack of legroom is so obvious between the two aircraft and it amazes me at the inconsistency of their products. Their flight attendants are top notch and meals are sumptuous though short in quantity. Due to my Silver Status with their FFP I was accorded a complimentary stay at the Golden Tulip in Bahrain for the duration of the 11 hours connecting time.

### Gulf Air customer review
I reserved seats together for my wife and 2 sons but the seats had been given to 3 adult male Bahrainis and my family were expected to be separated. After an argument they were given seats together. The plane was grubby and service lousy. On the return journey the steward gave the impression that serving a woman was beneath him and he treated my wife with ignorance and disdain. They have lost us as customers even if they are the last plane out.

### Gulf Air customer review
BAH-MAA. Flight delayed by an hour. Comfortable seating for A321. Food palatable. In-flight service was okay. MAA-BAH take-off delayed by more than two hours! Highly irritating. Otherwise comfortable seating. Palatable food. Decent in-flight service. Pretty expensive compared to Emirates and Etihad. Poor entertainment facility. The only reason to continue flying GF is direct flights to India. Not worth recommending otherwise.

### Gulf Air customer review
KWI-BAH-LHR roundtrip on Economy. KWI-BAH on new A321. Check in and security fast seats comfortable and aircraft clean. Flight not busy and crew friendly and upbeat snack box served. No IFE newspapers and magazines were offered. 4 hour connection time in Bahrain used Gulf Air business lounge which despite showing signs of wear still offers good service cold and hot snacks and free wifi. BAH-LHR on A330 got 3 seats by window to myself - not very comfortable for sleeping but better than trying to sleep upright! Plenty of pillows and blankets offered. Crew polite and efficient and food was fine. In flight entertainment not AVOD offered a decent selection. Cleared LHR immigration with IRIS which is great however there was no priority baggage handling. LHR-BAH : now that Gulf Air uses T4 they no longer have their own lounge- they now share with Skyteam. T4 is pretty gloomy at night and most concessions were closed. On plus side security was faster to clear than at T3. A340 left on time crew efficient and minimally polite. Food and comfort decent and early arrival ahead of schedule into Bahrain. Was able to standby for an earlier flight that day. BAH-KWI on A319 busy flight crew were pleasant and courteous. Snack box served. Considering this is economy class not a bad experience and very good value considering the fare I paid.

### Gulf Air customer review
LHR-BAH-DAC return. 3 out of 4 flights were late. On outgoing journey we had a six hour connection and this was extended to over 8 hours by the delay but no food was offered. There were no announcements at BAH explaining the delays or giving an accurate idea how long it would be. When the connection arrived boarding took a long time as there did not seem to be enough staff. It was necessary to go through security at BAH to get to connecting flights. Inflight entertainment was poor. Only positive point on DAC-BAH flight we were upgraded to Business class.

### Gulf Air customer review
LHR-BAH-BKK return. Cramped tatty planes no IFE filthy toilets rude surly and unprofessional check-in staff poor flight attendants and vile food. It’s not that the flights were cheap either. Never again with Gulf Air.

### Gulf Air customer review
It is one thing to have luggage arrive late to have the plane leave 5 hours late causing you to miss your next international connection and to have the check in staff laughing and joking about mistakes. But it is additionally troublesome when you get no information and /or information that is so ludicrous it cannot possibly be true and information that is contradictory between agents. This does not build trust in an airline we never will fly Gulf Air again.

### Gulf Air customer review
London to Manila with stop over at Bahrain - Gulf Air were the cheapest fare. Headphones worked in only one ear. Carpets dirty. Food disgusting and used trays took ages to be taken away. The crew on the plane were alright but check in desk staff were not friendly and more interested in laughing and joking with each other than serving.

### Gulf Air customer review
Flight to Dubai initially delayed one hour then three. Was offered flight to Abu Dhabi plus a taxi ride - took this option as I needed to get to a meeting - and then 30 minutes later that was cancelled. If Bahrain wants to be 'business friendly' it needs to have a reliable schedule of flights provided by Gulf Air!

### Gulf Air customer review
DAM-BAH-KUL. Flight delayed out of Damascus but was above the Minimum Connecting Time so my family and I were not worried. Crew attentive. From Bahrain the flight was full crew attentive and did an excellent job. The problem was their aged A340 and clogged toilets. When Gulf Air receives new aircraft their product will be far better.

### Gulf Air customer review
BAH-BKK in Economy. Cramped seats plane 100% full. IFE where I was was falling apart and wouldn't extend. Sound only coming out of one headphone because of a fault in the seat. Meals gone downhill since I knew it. I used to fly a lot before to LHR in previous years. Cabin attendants are hurried and rushed. On the return it was just as bad and there were no IFE at all. The last time I fly with Gulf long-haul unless new planes arrive.

### Gulf Air customer review
LHR-BKK-LHR. The outward flights were overbooked and service delivery slow and painful. Two point service from front of economy to the rear with the usual 1 choice of meal left at the end. I found the crew reasonably good. IFE ok but not on demand and some of the channels were jumping around. Bahrain is a great airport cosy all the facilities you require and a great duty free area. On return the flight from BKK to BAH was again overbooked and had no seat back tvs. The headphones had no cushion covers for the earpieces and no blankets but crew good - you do have to ask for drinks. BAH-LHR very pleasant as there was only about 45 of us onboard so loads of room attentive service and good IFE. If looking for a good price and reasonable service then give Gulf a go via Bahrain for good duty free.

On the first leg from LHR to Bahrain the plane was filthy trays hadn't been cleaned and we were put right at the back of the plane - so by the time we got any food there wasn't anything worth having. Second leg Bahrain to Bangkok even worse - no inflight entertainment and plane was also very dirty. Staff were pleasant enough but nothing compared with Qatar Emirates and Etihad. Booked with Gulf Air as I thought it would save me money - but for the sake of £50 next time I will choose another airline. Watch out when you get to Bahrain - they tell you one gate number and then it suddenly changes so its a mad dash to get to the right gate in time.

### Gulf Air customer review
Flight delayed Bahrain to Jeddah (Monday). Now Wednesday and stuck in Jeddah - flight back to Bahrain is also delayed this time by more than 3 hours. Dont know why I bother it's just a never ending story with Gulf Air. Advise that you avoid Gulf whenever possible!
