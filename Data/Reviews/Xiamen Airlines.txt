### “nothing to write home about”
They advertise on the plane that they are a 5 Star APEX Company, but the competition must have been terrible, because I did not see even a 3 stars approach on this trip: Very small, basic snack, no wine, no in-seat entertainment, standard seats (ok, there was a USB connection), magazine in Chinese, really nothing to write home about. Good thing was that the plane left on time and arrived on time, but this is the only really positive thing I can mention.

### "excellent value for money"
Not Verified |  Highly recommended airline, offering excellent value for money. I booked my flight from Bali to Doha via Xiamen and received three full meals, a 24-hour entry permit to explore Xiamen during my 18-hour transit, a free single hotel room, and a free shuttle from airport to hotel, all for $200. It is simply incredible to believe that you can fly from Bali to China to Doha for only $200.

### "experience is a unique one"
Not Verified |  The experience is a unique one, and I also have a trouble on how to rate this airline. We start off from Singapore's Changi Airport and the check in was quite smooth( note that their carry-on is only 5kg) we get our boarding pass finish security and customs, we finally managed to board the plane, the cabin crew was very sweet and nice , we are not delayed however the landing was super bad.

### "attendants are friendly and polite"
The cabin is clean. Flight attendants are friendly and polite. Seats can be reclined easily. The food is delicious and fresh. Flights departed on time.

### "such unreliable schedule"
I booked a round-trip Xiamen Airlines for my coming March 2024 Osaka trip. Due to the long transit time, I book hotels for the round-trip. After the booking, Xiamen Airlines made several changes to the flight schedule. All those changes are minor. But each time I receive a change, it is very stressful to ensure that my trip will not be badly affected. On 20 Feb 2024, Xiamen Airlines made a very drastic change in the flight schedule by 1 day later. This drastic change of course adversely affected my trip. Given such unreliable schedule, I do not think I want to book Xiamen Airline anymore. Now I have to work with the travel booking company to cancel my flight and hotel bookings. Request for a full refund. And search & book another flight.

### "disappointed with this airline"
Not Verified |  Very disappointed with Xiamen Airlines. I went back to china in October 2023 and checked in two luggage bags, everything went well. When I came back to the USA from china things happened. First they cancelled the flight, then they transferred me to other airlines but only allowed me to checked in only one luggage bag! And the manager on duty in the airport on that day couldn’t solve the problem, she seemed like just wasted my time because I didn’t have time to argue as I needed to board first in order to catch the next flight to the United States. She asked me to pay for the second luggage by myself which was the only way that I could do. I tried to explain that I came from America with two bags, she said maybe other staff made mistake and later they would do investigation then someone would contact with me. However more than two weeks have passed, nobody contacted me. Very disappointed with this airline and I feel very angry about what they did.

### "Dont fly with them"
Not Verified |   Worst airline ever. They lost my bag. Already waiting 3 days to pick it up. Instead of delevering it to my hotel they leave me waiting and barely replying to my emails. Dont fly with them

### "I was happy with Xiamen Airlines"
Was very happy with most aspects of the flight except for the huge waste of time having to go through the arrivals procedure with luggage and check in again the next morning when bags could have stayed in the airport. On my return flight, I went through arrivals again and then did not know where to go to get the free hotel. I ended up at the transfer desk where hustlers were telling me no more room at hotels but they could take me to a hotel for 30$. The Airport staff using their phone apps to translate advised me where to go. I was happy with Xiamen Airlines except for the fact that I paid extra for premium economy but after boarding found that it did not exist. The cabin staff suggested I contact a Chinese number which didn't make any sense as I couldn't use my phone in Xiamen. I just emailed them for a refund. The Xiamen hotel was super and the buffet breakfast was superb. Glad to have walked around Xiamen for a few hours before flying further.

### "They have no care"
I bought a business class from Amsterdam to Kuala Lumpur via Xiamen and I only had 3h transit in China and according to China government less than 24h traveler do not need to get transit visa. The Xiamen Airlines crew has not a good knowledge and they deny me boarding and i have suffered losses. Now they are even care to check what mistake they have done to refund my ticket money even. They have no care and no customer service.

### “I will not fly with them again”
I flew from Denpasar to Amsterdam in December 2023 with a transit in Xiamen. The flights themselves were fine but the transit in Xiamen is a hassle and not worth the lower price the airlines offers compared to their competitors. On the route I flew, the main competitors are KLM, Qatar airways, Emirates and Singapore Airlines. To transit in Xiamen to your onward flight, you need to clear immigration twice which means filling in a form, queueing up, cleariing immigration as if Xiamen is your final destination and you are entering China (which I was not). Some other travellers have reported being questioned by immigration (WHY?) and even being held for an hour or so. In my opinion, this is unncessary and inappropriate. Then also you have to go to the check in area again, wait in line and check in separately for your connecting flight whereas it is common that you are checked in and receive boarding passes for all your flights at the point of origin. I have sent an e-mail to Xiamen about this and am awaiting their reply. For now I will not fly with them again until the transit procedure has been changed to not require going through immigration and checking in separately for a connecting flight. None of the competing airlines mentioned require these things, allowing for a more pleasant experience and more time to relax and use airport facilities.

### “not worth the price we paid”
Not Verified |  Cabin crew is good and courteous. Food in Business Class from KL to Xiamen was really not reflective of price you paid, can say worse than any food you get in a local Malaysian coffeeshop. The return flight to KLIA has better food but still not up to the mark for Business Class. No wine was served. Bread is cold. The seat has no TV monitor and no power or USB plug in points. It is also hard to adjust the seat. It reminded me of the 737 plane we took in the 90s. I would rate it as a low cost carrier and not worth the price we paid. Some LCC is better than this. Maybe their Economy section is better than other airlines but I wont know.

### "really nice experience"
Not Verified |  Had a really nice experience with Xiamen airlines. The crew was really nice and helpful. Food was good. Enough legspace. Xiamen airport is small and it was hard to get wifi but ask the staff and you will be oke.

### "worst airline I have taken so far"
It is the worst airline I have taken so far. Poor passenger service during check in. You can’t see any facial expressions from the staff face, look like so crucial and unhappy. The staff attitude is also a disaster. Can’t answer the questions properly and put so much weight constraint in the luggage weight, even there is not much exceeding of the weight. Do not recommend to take this airline if there is alternative airline.

### "not worth the hassle and stress"
A chaotic and uncoordinated experience from beginning to end. Their booking site shows one price in the calendar, then much higher when you go to book. You try to request a special meal: after a lot of emails and even requests to send your passport by email (!) you are told it can’t be done. Meat meals only. You try to check-in online. This option is being implemented”. Except it’s not. The flights from Amsterdam are jam-packed and everyone’s randomly allocated a seat before check-in is opened, so there’s nowhere to move seats to even if you come early. Yes you could (perhaps) have bought a seat during booking if you feel $54 US is a fair price for 67B. The booking process loses my frequent flyer number (deliberately?) Confusing emails (some only in Mandarin) are sent about how to pay for a return flight if you’re denied entry for covid reasons. You have to register a RAT test on a dysfunctional government website (yes travel in August 2023 still requires RAT tests). Airport Check-in is full of misinformation: Skyteam check-in staff have been told that bags and boarding passes are good only to Xiamen, then you’ll have to leave the airport and go through the whole process again. This is “because there are so many people on the flight”. Hello?!! Amsterdam to Xiamen is chock a block full, with nice attendants, reasonably clean plane and 31” legroom, but it’s ghastly looking chicken or beef only, and no bassinets mean screaming babies are randomly scattered around the plane. Can't understand dialogue on films with the awful headphones; bring your own. People who wanted windows have been given aisles and vice versa, couples seated apart, etc, and it was all solvable; 11hrs is a long flight. Disembarkation is met with long unexplained delays. Xiamen airport is a confused mess. Eventually, after 90 minutes chasing our luggage, it’s discovered that bags DID go through, but it’s not possible to check-in till 3hrs before the next flight (9hrs). You have to join the massive customs queue anyway. Transfer passengers are guided (well, not really … you eventually find it by queueing in the wrong place) to a subterranean basement for 6hrs; I try my luck with the free hotel. 2.5hrs after landing I’m there. It’s good (but be prepared to share a room), but you have to find 100 yuan somewhere for the taxi (on a Sunday it was only 25 each way but you should allow 50). Money changers charge a whopping €5 commission even for small amounts. Hotel has no free wifi for foreigners and staff speak zero English. Check in again (regardless of whether you went to a hotel or not) maximum 3hrs before the flight. Oh, except if the immigration or customs officers have found something they don’t like about you. My neighbour (from Spain) was detained by them for 3hrs over questions about her Australian visa which were already resolved in Amsterdam. She shouldn’t even have had to deal with them as she was planning on staying in transit. This is not possible at XMN. Once again the terminal wifi is not working (no authorization codes for foreign phones). There’s no help desk. Sit in boredom in an extraordinarily dull terminal. Yes I saved €100 but it was absolutely not worth the hassle and stress. I’ll stick to more professional airlines in future!

### "avoid Xiamen Airlines"
My first time on Xiamen Airlines and it will be my last after I use my return ticket to Amsterdam. The aircraft was quite modern, and the business class seat was quite comfortable, a standard 1-2-1 layout. That is where the good ends. The staff were unable to speak or understand English, and the service is done to suit Chinese customers only, not for foreigners. The food was very bland and limited choice, the hot dishes not properly heated, and white wine and soft beverages incl water were served warm. The amenities were cheap and below acceptable levels. Most airlines economy service is a lot better than this, and they should be ashamed that this is what they provide on international routes. Before Covid I used Hainan Airlines from Brussels, and they were so much more advanced than Xiamen Airlines. As a warning to other international travelers, I say to avoid Xiamen Airlines.

### "a trip I wish I forget"
Business class flight seating was good. Very friendly service, even though English communication was limit. Flight attendants were on point and helpful. The nightmare started when I landed in XMN awaiting my transfer flight to BKK. Covid restrictions had the airport lounge closed down! The hotel service provide was 20 minutes away in a known covid positive area. The Official at the desk had limited skills and stated there is a risk my health code would change and I wouldn't be able to board my flight tomorrow, nothing he could do. No refunds for this situation. Very poor manners, ended staying on a bench outside of the airport ,after the airport it's self lock the doors around 2 am. BTW flight is scheduled for 9am, Flight times changed twice on day of departure. On the ground service and attitude was horrible. First time flying business class with this airline was a trip I wish I forget.

### "bad structure of this airline"
Today I had dinner with my company, so i had booked the flight for 9pm. The flight was rescheduled to 7pm. I missed the dinner because of that. Came to the airport on time and the flight was deleted one hour. This seems to be a joke, but it's not. I see this as a bad management or bad structure of this airline. It made my day a very bad day

### "has been, by far, the worst airline"
This has been, by far, the worst airline that I have ever had the misfortune to encounter. I showed up at Xiamen Airport (Xiamen Airlines flagship hub) 5 hours in advance of my flight for two reasons. First, I knew that my bags would be overweight (I was moving back home to the states), and I wanted to see by how much. I had some items I could discard to make the baggage lighter, but I wanted to see how much over I was. Second, since COVID still had regulations, I wanted to be sure that I had enough time to get through the process on time. Xiamen Airlines, unfortunately, did not make any of this process possible. When I arrived at the airport, I was informed that I would not be able to set foot into the international wing until two hours before the flight took off. This forced me to wait until they opened the wing. Once the wing was open, the sold-out flight loaded up the kiosks. The line was moving unbelievably slow, but I knew that the attendants were able to see me waiting and that I probably will need extra help. This entire process of getting through the line nearly took an hour and a half. Once I got to the front of the line, the first thing that they informed me of was that there were only middle seats left. I said to them that they saw me waiting in line, and I am considerably taller than most of the people on the flight. Rather than give any explanation, the only thing they said was, “we know”. Checking my watch, I knew that there was no time to belabor the point any longer. I had three bags, and I knew that they would have weight problems. In addition, I would need to pay extra for the third bag. I was ready to pay for the extra bag, but what happened next was madness. I sent them countless emails explain my grievances with the airline, and it took them literal days(and one time a week) to respond to me. The fact that this could not be resolved in a matter of minutes was frustrating enough, but then for them to not care about my original complaint and say that it was my fault is what drove me to write this complaint today. It took them 3.5 weeks to even come to a resolution.

### "avoid buying flight tickets from Xiamen Air"
Chinese Embassy in the Netherlands announced that no transfer passengers would be allowed to enter the Netherlands for the connecting flight to China from 18th November. XiaMen Airline is aware of this new policy. However, they continue advertising and selling the connecting flight tickets through the Netherlands! I bought the ticket from London to China via an overnight transfer in Amsterdam. However, when I started to go through the details soon after I bought the ticket, I was shocked to find out that this is an impossible flight route due to the reason above. I contacted XiaMen Airline immediately. I received a reply call informing me that my request for refunding my flight ticket is rejected. The reason given was that XiaMen Airline made a policy, they only refund the flight tickets which were bought before 31st October 2020, and the flight will take off after 31st October 2020. My flight ticket was bought yesterday, 9th December 2020. Therefore, I fell out of the category of refunding. I pointed out that if they knew this is the policy, why they were still selling the tickets from London to China, which needs to transfer at Amsterdam. I was told that it was because some passengers will take the flights from Amsterdam. This was not answering my question. However, the customer service only gave me standard answers in a circle. I would advise all, try all means to avoid buying flight tickets from Xiamen Air.

### "overall a pleasant flight"
It was overall a pleasant flight. The flight attendant is very familiar with the policies and helpful with the required custom forms under the pandemic. There is no hot food due to the pandemic, but it is totally understandable. I would recommend everyone get food from the airport or city before the get on board. Everyone is nice to the passengers in general, but the cabin manager is mean to her peer. I don't agree with that way of management. At least they should avoid making passengers feel that way.

### "I am extremely disappointed"
Not Verified |  Los Angeles to Ho Chi Minh via Xiamen. I am extremely disappointed in the customer service I received from this airline. I paid $748.00 to change the flight for me and my partner, because I was given the wrong date to return on. $400 of that fee was just for them to make the change. Shortly after making this payment they involuntarily changed the flight I had just paid to change. I was able to call and cancel my flights but they refused to give me the $400 back for the cost the to make the change, which they immediately changed which take away the point of paying $400 of a specific flight home that matches our schedule.

### "looked fatter than my passport photo"
Never fly with Xiamen airline again! Irresponsible staff and an airline who’s only interested in snatching money from customers. On November 2019 I was booked for the flight traveling from Seoul to Vancouver but at the check-in counter they denied my boarding because I looked fatter than my passport photo. What the hell! Another airline flew me back home and gave me no troubles, I passed border security checks absolutely no problems. Only ridiculous Xiamen airline caused me so much trouble. When I asked them to return my flight ticket money, they agreed, but it’s been 2 months now I still don’t see my money returned to my bank account. They never pick up their phones, when I try contacting by email they just give me excuses like oh we are still processing your return. Really? How many months do you need to process a return Xiamen airline?

### " Outstanding value for money"
Bangkok to Los Angeles via Xiamen return. Everything was great, check-in at Suvarnabhumi Airport was smooth and the flight from Bangkok to Xiamen was on-time and they served a tasty meal. We noticed how friendly the cabin crew were r. Only downside about the 737 from Bangkok is that there's no personal tv screen. At Xiamen Airport for our 18-hour layover, immigration process was smooth, we were eligible for a free transit visa. We received a free accommodation voucher by Xiamen Air. The hotel we were given was the airline's own Xiamen Air Hotel in the heart of Xiamen. The room had two double beds and included a Chinese buffet breakfast too. Xiamen to Los Angeles on Boeing 787-9 was better. Great on-board entertainment, with plenty of Hollywood movies to choose from. We were served 3 meals and a snack on the 12-hour journey to LAX. I applied for their free wifi in advance (only 50 spots per flight), which worked well. You only get 3-hours but it was free. One thing that surprised me was the English proficiency of their crew. An added bonus was the opportunity to visit the lovely Chinese coastal city of Xiamen. The price we paid for our return journey from BKK to LAX was almost half the price of a return ticket from BKK to SYD at the time of our departure. Outstanding value for money.

### "everything average"
Dalian to Bangkok via Fuzhou. A very strange flight, both International and domestic passengers to Fuzhou, you then vacate the plane rush through immigration and then get back on the same plane with new customers from Fuzhou going to Bangkok. The return is the same, apart from at Dalian you are bused to the terminal in two separate buses, one for people from Bangkok the other for new passengers from Fuzhou. Bags come out in different sections of Dalian airport. It very confusing and only one hour on ground in Fuzhou, makes it a rush job. Seating average, food average, actually everything average.

### "No humanity at all"
Vancouver to Manila via Xiamen. Your policy for re-booking is crazy. You are a money grabber. I will never book to your airline anymore. I will see to it that my relatives and friends here and around the world do not book a flight with your airlines because you're so greedy. No humanity at all!

### "This flight is the worst"
Fuzhou to Jakarta. This flight is the worst I have ever had. The plane have to divert to Palembang and there is no update on the Jakarta flight. All passengers have to wait with no certainty for several hours on the plane. This is the last trip with this airline

### "The seats are comfortable"
Xiamen to Amsterdam. The flight attendants are kind, willing to assist with cabin luggage. The English they speak is okay. The seats are comfortable and stuff like long socks, blankets, earphones and pillows are offered. Most of the time, I fly solo with Xiamen Airlines, but this June when I flew with my partner (German nationality), they offered great help both by email and at the airport for my partner's 144 hours transit visa free, The food and beverages onboard is good; for breakfast and dinner they have at least two options between Chinese and Western food. The dishes taste good and the portion is  big. During late night, they offer sandwiches and hand out some warm towels or tea. Before landing, breakfast is offered. The content of movies is a bit limiting for Hollywood movies, but there's a big collection of Chinese/Japanese and Korean series and films.

### "crew were really pleasant"
Dublin to Xiamen via Amsterdam. The crew were really pleasant and went out of their way to be helpful. Very clean plane and comfortable seat - the usual lie flat. Entertainment was so poor with a very small selection of movies. Maybe we expect more as the western/mid-eastern airlines give you a really decent selection. The food was below par and no great shakes at all. Big no-no - they did not serve any vodka! This is a very first for me on any airline worldwide and I fly 30-40 times a year. With gin is this possibly the worlds most popular white spirt? I only drink an odd vodka and tonic so I went without. However, for the value and it was an offer, I had to give 4 stars. Other airlines for my destination were €4-500 more expensive and that is a big saving. If the fare narrows to €2-250 I would fly another.

### "probably the last time"
Los Angles to Jakarta via Xiamen and a stop in Qingdao that was not mentioned during reservation. Very competent crew, attentive and I found them to have an OK English but not fluent. The food was good for the most part. Poor management with long layovers. The air line damaged one piece of the luggage that they would not acknowledge( was soaked in oil) also the airline would not honor the flown miles which was very odd after communicating with them numerous times regarding that. It was the first time flying with them and probably the last time.

### "overall a good flight"
New York to Nanning via FuzhouThis was overall a good flight. Very competent crew. Very attentive and I found them to have an OK command of English but not fluent. From JFK to FOC the seats were comfortable and the IFE was adequate. The food was good for the most part. When drinks got low the flight attendants brought another without me having to ask. We had about a 15 hour layover in Fuzhou but they gave us a premium hotel room plus free transportation. The aircraft from Fuzhou to Nanning was changed to a single class 738. We were reimbursed the difference in cost between business class and economy and given priority boarding and our seats were left open in the middle so that we had more room. The flight was about 40 minutes late leaving Fuzhou but that was an air traffic control issue and not Xiamen Airlines issue. Well worth the money and I recommend this airline. My only issue are long layovers because I have another one on the upcoming trip home.

### "airline has great food"
Los Angeles to Melbourne via Xiamen. This was a long journey for me, from LAX to Melbourne via Xiamen. This airline has great food. The portion sizes were big enough, and they came through fairly frequently with drinks as well. The meals themselves were good. I loved the Chinese food selections, and the highlights for me were the breakfast rice porridge with egg and vegetables, and a fish and rice dish with raw salmon on the side, and a stir-fried noodle dish. The staff were generally friendly and nice. Inflight entertainment was good. Seats were comfy - I'm pretty small so maybe that's why. The journey from LAX to Xiamen was actually via Qingdao, and the journey from Xiamen to Melbourne was via Hangzhou and this was stated in my ticket. The wifi didn't connect on my phone.

### "we missed the Chengdu flight"
Xiamen to Los Angeles. It was the worst experience ever. We had 2 flights, the one we did not take which was Chengdu to Xiamen and then Xiamen to LA. The persons who dealt with us were extremely rude. Saying we could not take our flight to LA because we missed the Chengdu flight. They told us it was not their problem and if we wanted to leave the airport we would have to pay almost one thousand dollars. The flight was not even full. We were on time at the check in and they treated us badly. I would never flight on that airline again.

### "all unbelievably awful"
I had 4 flights with Xiamen Air during one trip. First flight (Guiyang-Fuzhou) was delayed for an hour. 2nd flight (Fuzhou - Kuala Lumpur) was fine and with no problem. 3rd flight (Kuala Lumpur - Fuzhou) was delayed for two hours, 4th flight (Fuzhou - Guiyang) was cancelled. They replaced last flight with the flight next morning (provided transfer and hotel) and this flight is delayed too! Right now we're sitting inside the airplane and waiting for the info on how long delay is. Each time their excuse was - air traffic. That's all unbelievably awful!

### "left my luggage behind"
Not Verified |  Amsterdam to Taipei via Xiamen. The airline left my luggage behind in Amsterdam when I had one of the transfers, probably due to short time to change planes. The beginning was fine- they took all the details, they knew exactly where my luggage was left, so they looked very professional. I could not be at home at the time they had scheduled the courier to arrive, so I asked if the luggage can be delivered at a specific time, which was still within their working hours. They agreed to that. The courier has not arrived. They did not leave any message about that. Then, the next day when I called, they were surprised the luggage was not delivered, and they asked me to wait at home all day (9am-5pm) to receive the courier, despite I mentioned I need to go out and get something to eat. My friend who speaks Chinese called, and my luggage will not be delivered today. The staff has misinformed me and I would have waited in vain all day sitting in the flat. At one point one staff member because he did not seem to understand what I am saying just hang me up. Before the flight, I also send an inquiry, and they did not answer at all. Thus, the airline completely lacks communication. Otherwise, the flight is well-attended, 2 hot meals and one breakfast for 10.5 hour flight, and comfortable seats.

### "for the Chinese not others"
Chongqing to Xiamen. An airline that would be for the Chinese people not others, we had two flights with them Chongqing to Xiamen then on to Ho Chi Min. Both flights had delays of over an hour, food was pretty bad, although some English spoken it wasn’t understandable.

### "because it was cheaper"
Just finished a round trip LAX - Qingdao - xiamen - Taipei. The return trip didn't involve Qingdao. I picked this airline because it was cheaper than China and Eva air. There were actually even cheaper fares with Air China and China eastern but I refuse to fly with them due to the horrendous reviews. 787 for the Long haul were nice. Planes were fairly new. Good amount of pitch. Movie selections were limited but adequate. Food was terrible for our taste. The kids meal for my 11 year old was also mostly inedible. Service was great however. Flight attendants had great attitude and seemed to be working nonstop. 737 between Xiamen and Taipei was old and dirty. Don't understand why they would also offer a meal for such a short flight. I hate wasting food but couldn't eat that one either. Transit at Qingdao was confusing. We were given the wrong arrival cards twice so had to rewrite them 3 times. Transit hotel in Xiamen was free for our 8 hour layover. Hotel was not in good shape. I would rate it 2.5 star. On our return trip, we took the hotel option again and asked if we could pay extra for a better hotel. He said no and insisted to give us 3 rooms for the 5 of us. Then he entered in one of the names wrong on the reservation. I now have some personal information of some guy named Dustin. The hotel this time is a different. Not as bad, maybe a 3.5 star. But both hotels didn't have non-smoking rooms. I overheard another guest requesting a non-smoking room and was rudely told to come back down and ask for another room she didn't like the room. We don't think we'll fly Xiamen again. Layover in Xiamen would be nice if the city had much to offer.

### Xiamen Airlines customer review
Bangkok to Los Angeles via Xiamen. My wife was not allowed to board the plane on March 14. They would not work with us at all on rebooking us or refunding ticket even though she arrived at airport 4 hours before scheduled boarding. She has Thailand Passport and so they would not allow her to fly through Xiamen. I had to scramble and book very expensive flight for that night through Philippine Airlines. I will never book with this company again!

### "comfortable seat on Boeing 787-82
Singapore to Los Angeles via Xiamen. Enjoy when inside aircraft which clean and comfortable seat on Boeing 787-8. Plenty of food and drinks provided. The only problem when check in to the flight from Xiamen Airport to Singapore Changi Airport. Long queue as many other tour tourist line up. Ground handling spoil / damaged my baggage but Xiamen Airline replaced new baggage for me.

### "pair you with other travellers"
Ho chi Minh to Los Angeles via Xiamen. Good flight. Check in fast and easy Boarding. Meals and services was good. Clean aircraft offer bottle of water and peanuts before meal services. Offer drinks entire the flights. Only things communications with cabin crew. If they know what you want they will help you. If not, they just ignore you. Transit in Xiamen they provide free hotels over 8 hours layover. If you are solo traveller try to pay extra because otherwise they will pair you with other travellers. You have to pay taxi.

### "not going use this airline again"
Not Verified |  Los Angeles to Denpasar via Xiamen. It was pretty clean cabin. I didn't like food at all. I am vegetarian, and system didn't allowed me to choose my food preference, when I called the company (24 prior my flight), they said it is too late. Also, system didn't let me to check in, I had to check in in the airport. What I hate most is on my way back to the States, I had go pro camera in my suitcase, which was stolen. I'm not going use this airline again.

### "everything  normal and fine"
Dalian to Hong Kong via Fuzhou. The flights were both short, normal food, everything are normal and fine. The things I really appreciately are the transit service and cabin service for Skyteam ElitePlus members. From Dalian to Hong Kong there is no directly flight, but connecting with Xiamen airline with international flight, they offer free transit hotel if the flights are on a different day with 24 hours gap. The flight attendants come to say greetings to me, with a small water and newspaper.

### "Legroom is comfortable"
Xiamen to Ho Chi Minh. Great flight with cheap ticket. Legroom is comfortable, food is good and cabin crew is superb. Our flight is 252 usd for return flight from HCM to Shanghai via Xiamen Airport.

### "last time we travel with Xiamen"
Singapore to Shanghai via Fuzhou. While at Fuzhou, we were late at check in and was not allow to fly and miss the Fuzhou to Shanghai leg. Customer service at the airport did nothing to help except to tell us that the entire return ticket was invalid due to airline policy. We wrote to Xiamen airline to seek help to reinstate ticket and they take more than 3 days to reply and suggest we try our luck at the airport. Subsequently, we wechat Xiamen staff in china and was told that our flight is normal and we can check in. On the day, at Shanghai airport, we were told we were not allow to board. Overall, unhelpful and inefficient ground staff and confusing messages make this the last time we will travel with Xiamen air.

### "they are a 3rd rate airline"
Not Verified |  Seattle to Manila via Xiamen. My wife and I planned a trip to the Philippines from Seattle and decided upon Xiamen Airlines Business Class. The routing was Seattle, Shenzen, Xiamen and Manila. We traveled late October 2018. The seating configuration in the Boeing 787, Business Class was 2-2-2. The seats were lay flat for sleeping, but unfortunately were leatherette covered which meant one would slide forward when seated upright due to the slippery covering. Lunch was served and I chose duck. This was the consistency of rubber and virtually inedible. The 12.5 hour flight was uneventful, however during this time the cabin staff barely checked on us. When they did, there was a distinct language problem. We couldn't understand them and they couldn't understand us! One would think when one is on a international flight a common understandable language should be used. When we arrived at Shenzen we had a layover of 2 hours during which time we had to clear Chinese Customs and Immigration. After this we had to wait in a departure lounge without being told anything about our next flight leg. There were about 12 onward passengers waiting for the next leg. Eventually we were told our boarding gate and ETD. The flight to Xiamen was around 1 hour. After arrival we had to pick up our luggage and we went to the Xiamen Airlines counter to get a hotel voucher as we had 20 hour layover. Xiamen Airlines to not have a hotel bus or any means to transport us to the hotel. We had to change money to get a taxi. This was an effort in its own right. We did leave some of our baggage at the left luggage office at the airport, which helped. The next day we caught a taxi back to the airport. We go through security on entry to the airport before checking in for our flight to Manila. I should mention that boarding to Manila like the short leg for Shenzen was chaos. No boarding by class or seating, just go for it! Service on board was almost like a domestic flight, again a language problem. We arrive in Manila after almost 36 hours after leaving Seattle. It was nice to experience the friendliness of Philippine Customs and Immigration. The return from Manila to Seattle every bit as bad as when we arrived late (11:30pm) in Xiamen we had to clear customs and immigration and by the time that happened it was around 2am banks were closed and we had now money for a taxi to the hotel we finally change $20 with a Xiamen Airline staff member and got to the hotel around 2:30 am. We were again routed via Shenzen and had to go through immigration and carry ALL bags through security. The flight back was slightly better, but there was still the language barrier. All in all the Xiamen Airlines experience was poor. The airline should make sure the cabin staff have sufficient English to carry out a basic conversation. The airline should upgrade all staff to a level of what is expected from a good international airline. At the moment they are a 3rd rate airline.

### "at a very cheap price"
Singapore to Vancouver via Xiamen. Note that my rating here is for XMN-YVR, not considering SIN-XMN, and not taking into account the visa issues at XMN. If you are not a holder of one of the 53 countries' passports that qualify for visa exemption by the Chinese government, then you need to apply for a visa before flying. XMN does not offer visa services at the airport. The main reason for the need of a visa is, XMN does not have a usual transit arrangement, which usually doesn't require you to go through immigration. At XMN, in order to transit, you have to go through immigration, which means you are entering China and then leaving China officially, just to transit between flights. This is why people transiting with passports that do not qualify for visa exemption have to apply for visa. If you are unsure, please make sure you email your local Xiamen Air representatives to check. Regarding SIN-XMN, it was below average. It was an older aircraft, without individual IFE system. The stewardesses were willing to help and respond to demands, but they were typically brisk and curt with their responses. Food was okay, not remarkable. XMN-YVR was excellent. The economy seat was comfortable, and leg room was good. Food was excellent and more than sufficient. In fact, the stewardesses made rounds between meals to ask if people wanted snacks, like bread rolls, sandwiches, or peanuts. The stewardesses were very friendly and approachable, very willing to help the passengers. It is unfortunate that their command of the English language is below average, but if you speak Mandarin, then you are fine. All in, it was an excellent flight at a very cheap price. I think, if you are travelling on Xiamen Air's Boeing 787, then there is a good chance that your flight will be a very good one. But if you are travelling on Xiamen Air's older aircraft, then you may not get to experience the better side of the airline. Finally, there is no online check-in services for international flights for Xiamen Air. You can choose your seats only if you spend some money. Otherwise, you have to request for your seat at the counter at the airport. So, if you want to choose your seats, either pay for it, or go to the airport and check in early (I went 2.5hr before flight) to get the seats that you want.

### "tasty Chinese food"
Kuala Lumpur to Xiamen. The aircraft offers basic comfort and only overhead entertainment. I was impressed by the crew service - they were polite to the elderly folks onboard, checking on them and offering them blanket and pillow. The food is very local and tasty Chinese food, which I enjoyed. I will fly Xiamen Airlines again.

### "impressed by this airline"
Hong Kong to Wuyishan. It's a leisure trip to visit the homeland of tea: Wuyishan, Fujian province. Xiamen Airlines does a twice weekly direct flight from Hong Kong. They deploy a small 737 aircraft. Similar to Malaysia airlines when using this small aircraft, 4 cabin crew work tirelessly to keep the journey smooth and comfortable. With one aisle and 3x3 seating, the pitch is quite comfortable. A simple hot meal (in the style of a bento box) is served, and is sufficient for a short 90 minutes journey. 2 rounds of drinks is a nice touch. Seat has no power outlet or personal, we were provided visual entertainment in the form of overhead TV, with mainly Chinese program. Luckily, since January, mobile phones in flight mode are now allowed to be used on board. So you can still listen to your favourite music, or watch your own videos etc., on your phone or tablets. That really help kill time. If there is one complaint, it's the excessively warm cabin temperature. I am impressed by this airline. I wouldn't mind trying them for long haul flights in future.

### "food was fantastic"
Sydney to Fuzhou. The service in flight was good. The food was fantastic compare to Air China. Too many peoples onboard during the flight. We had to wait when we arrived Xiamen.

### "first airline to make me cry"
In my entire life of flying cheap, this is the first airline to ever make me cry, out of frustration and feeling beaten up. Not once, but twice. Booked a trip from Sydney to Fuzhou via Kunming. I arrived at Sydney airport only to find out that my Fuzhou - Kunming has been changed (amusingly and amazingly) to earlier than my flight from Sydney. Talked to service desk, couldn't help, gave me a number to call. Called all the numbers he gave, none worked. Went on Google and called the number online. They speak Chinese in their automated voicing system. I had to get the guy from the service desk to go through it for me. Eventually answered but staff was so slow and gentle (my flight was in 2h). He tried to book my connecting flight 2 days later. I was crying so much, begging him that we have schedules booked and everyone will leave me behind. I don't speak Chinese and I don't know anyone. Finally managed to find me a flight the next morning. Put me on hold. Came back half an hour later saying their system crashed. Told me he couldn't help anymore, and that I have to hang up and call back and go through the line again. It was 1h before my flight and I still couldn't get my flight confirmed. I was crying so much that the guy at the service desk told me to charge some international calling on my phone and then he helped me call the airline in China. They got it sorted out in like 15min. I went through everything, got to the gate and my flight was annouced delay. For the return flight I went to the airport at 4am for my flight back at 7am. The girl at check in counter gave me 5 words of horror : "We can't find your flight" Turned out flight was cancelled (ah yes again) and have to take the one 5 hours later. Fine. Waited a few hours, went to check in again. This time there were 5 other words of horror: "Your passport number is incorrect. Uhm... Sorry? Double checked my booking. My passport was entered correctly. So imagine being by yourself, running around China airport trying to get this sorted when they don't speak English. No, seriously, save yourself the trouble and never fly with this airline. No matter how good their in-flight service is, it can't compensate all the time and emotions I have wasted on this. Never again. Period. I'm cheap but this is way beyond imagination. I am now making sure non of my friends or family is flying with them.

### "no personal TV"
Cebu to Xiamen return. Economy: food OK service okay but no personal TV. Business class: food OK service good but still  no personal tv, I was given an ipad to watch movies.

### "Better than Delta or United"
Los Angeles to Manila via Qingdao. Most impressed. Better than any Delta or United flight I've ever used. I was fed many times and received respectful treatment. I was particularly impressed by Xiamen airport. The view from the taxi port was as stunning as a ranked wonder of the world. LAX was particularly unremarkable. For an international airport it was just pathetic. Maybe 40 years ago LAX's art deco design was charming, but it just looks like a roadside tourist trap now. Doesn't even have usable wifi or updated drinking fountains.

### "try to avoid Xiamen Airlines"
Beijing to Fuzhou, and the experience is not good at all. It disappointed me a lot. I have to admit the food & beverage are decent. But I got cold before the flight so I tried to ask for a blanket from the cabin crew. The lady was not so nice and showed obvious impatience for such normal request; she told me she will remember but she never got back to me. The AC was strong and I had to suffer it for 3hrs.If possible, I will try to avoid Xiamen Airlines and also not recommend my friends to take it.

### "belligerent towards us"
Vancouver to Manila via Xiamen. Horrible service and no English. They lost my bags and didn't give compensation. 15% refund on being refused boarding without a reason. Worst airline. They pretend they can't understand English and care less about foreign travellers. Intentionally belligerent towards us.

### "comfortable and clean"
Xiamen to Guangzhou. Whilst it was an old aircraft it was very comfortable and clean. The crew were lovely and for a short flight the food was very good. The facilities at Xiamen airport are mostly supplied by the airline and are first class.

### "airline is the biggest scam"
Los Angeles to Bangkok via Xiamen. This airline is the biggest scam! I booked a flight from Los Angeles to Bangkok with three hours layover in Xiamen city. At the airport I was told that I can’t use Xiamen airlines because I don’t have Chinese transit visa. Xiamen airport does not have transit area for transit passengers so everyone has to go through customs, get out of the airport, and then walk back in to check in for the next flight. Be advised, you can’t get out of the airport unless you have Chinese visa. I have never heard that you need to get a transit visa for couple of hours layover. I was told to cancel my round trip with Xiamen airlines and get a refund. After 6-7 hrs of phone calls with the airline, I was issued 15% refund of the total cost. The agent explained that somehow my outbound ticket was activated (I flew with a different airline but they still activated my ticket!) and the “activated” ticket was 85% of the cost and I’m only getting 15% refund for the return flight. Don’t be fulled by this airlines! There is a reason they offer cheaper prices... they will streal your money and you will end up paying double.

### "stay clear of Xiamen Airlines"
Hong Kong to Xian via Xiamen. I had to book Xiamen Airlines because I would have to have an extra day in Hong Kong, so decided to stay in Xiamen over night. The flight was first delayed 1 hour then 2 and the 3:55 that’s almost 4 hours and another airlines flight to Xiamen went through so it was not the weather that caused the delay, by the time the third delay appeared on the board it was too late to cancel my hotel booking and get a refund, once I got out at Xiamen airport I had only two hours between my flight and next flight check-in, I first asked for a compensation, they said sorry, then later I asked for a hotel refund since clearly this was their mess up that led me to the mess up, also denied, then was told that the airport free hotel had no place and the lounges wouldn’t open for another two hours, will have to take my next flight soon and will have to have a sit down with a manager of some sort, of this is how they run their business I would stay clear of Xiamen Airlines and be careful considering to booking a ticket with them especially involving a non direct location.

### "new and fresh airline"
Los Angeles to Seoul via Xiamen. We booked this airline because 3 of us could go round trip for the price of 1 major carrier! Such a deal - R/T LAX to ICN (Seoul Korea) for $450 per person! If you are not Asian or don't like Asian food - please pack your own food. Found this airline to be just as professional, efficient, and friendly to fly with. Our flight did have to go thru 2 Chinese ports of entry (Qingdao & Xiamen). The flight was very comfortable due to the new airplane (Boeing 787-9). I noticed the increased air pressure (6000 ft elevation) and increased humidity did not dry me out and felt good at the end of 14 hours in flight. The flight staff was very courteous, attentive, and tried their best with English but Google translate came in handy to communicate. Wifi was available but not very good - too many people using it and not enough bandwidth for streaming. Food was good - 2 hot meals and 2 cold snacks in-between kept you full and satisfied. Very Chinese cuisines on all 4 legs of the flight (2 international, 2 domestic). Just remember, the airline is Chinese and therefore will serve Chinese food - don't expect Panda Express type food like the US. The food is primarily pork based with some fish, chicken or beef offering. If you elect vegetarian or muslim or any other special needs food, make sure you request this 24 hours before your flight. I saw some western folks unhappy with seeing unfamiliar Chinese food being served on a Chinese airline - I had to chuckle watching them eat the bread and desert for their meals. The only issue which is not the airline's fault was going thru Chinese immigration. We did not have a Chinese visa which is normally required for landing in China, but 50+ countries can "transit" thru China if you can prove your final destination is outside of China. The government issues a temporary transit visa for those that are going thru the country - it's good for 24 hours. At our 2 hr layover for refueling, Qingdao was the worst - they scrutinized and held up the entire non Chinese group of passengers looking for errors & past problems. They pulled 2 passengers out of the group for failing to register with a local Chinese police agency the last time they were in China. Military uniformed people surrounded them making you feel like you are in a communist country.... The airline staff was very good at preparing you for Chinese immigration - having your itinerary with you, boarding pass with correct name spelled, etc. Landing at Xiamen was much easier and nicer immigration folks. We even had time to visit the First class airport lounge using our Amex Plat card. Return trip was good and we even had an overnight layover and the airline provided a hotel for the night at no cost which was nice. We did have to pay the taxi rides both ways so remember to bring some Chinese Yuan (RMB) currency. We got to also go on a tour of the city on a double decker sightseeing bus that took us all around the perimeter of the island. Overall, a very nice new and fresh airline to fly with for many Asian countries.

### "The crew was attentive"
Kuala Lumpur to ShenYang via Xiamen. The crew was attentive, especially to the elderly Chinese on board, checking if they are comfortable and needs drink. Their food is very Chinese, and tasty. I like that they served steamed corn at the end. What I didn't like - lack of inseat entertainment.

### "fly another airline"
Bangkok to Vancouver via Xiamen. Took a chance on a bargain fare and you get what you pay for. If over 6 Foot and 195 Lbs, you best get an Isle seat safety door or you’ll have no room to move. If you get stuck in a window seat you’ll never get out of your seat. Being a bargain flight they pack you in worse than a sardine tin! If you want to change your flight date be aware the airline charges $159.00 US plus, plus to change. My partner wished to change her flight to an alternate day and it was cheaper to buy a ticket with another carrier. Xiamen Airport is hideous and they charge almost $20 US fee to exchange any money and only 2 food stores take credit cards. A bowl of soup and a bottle of water costs about $25.00 US This airline is good for backpackers only. Spend a little more and fly another airline.

### "Avoid this airline"
Manila to Los Angeles via Jingdiang / Quingdao. I have never taken the time to write a negative review in my life. Call me old fashioned, but I just do not care enough to complain online for other people to read. I booked a one way return flight on Xiamen a week or so ago from Manila to LAX with two layovers in China. I have flown with China Eastern, China Southern, Air China and China Airlines, so I thought nothing of it. Another pass through China and I would be in Los Angeles for my mothers birthday on the 16th. Upon arriving to the airport 2 hours early and checking in I was notified I could not board my flight because I didn't have proper clearance. I explained to the rep that I had no plans of entering CHINA and would only be passing through. Still not allowed. I explained I had been through China 4 times on layovers and never had an issue. Still not allowed. Long story short it took two hours arguing for the airlines to agree to a 30-60 day refund. It turns out Americans cant connect through their layover city so they are selling tickets that are unusable. No compensation. Just blank faced souless stares. Avoid this airline at all costs.

### "It was a nightmare!"
It was a nightmare! We are suppose to have fun traveling for Christmas vacation but turned out to be a disaster. We are going back to Philippines, our luggage were check in only up to Giandong. We have to go to immigration then get our luggage to check in going to Xiamen. Boarding pass were issued again going only to Xiamen. From Xiamen you have to go out then scan your hand carry for another scanning then get into a long line to get another boarding pass going to Manila. Cheap air fare but think if the hassle and exhaustion you will go through if you take this airline back home. I’m very tired and almost 24 hours in and out of the airport. My husband tried to get the early flight as chance passenger, without checking she said everything is taken. You have to wait for your flight .

### "I am extremely disappointed"
I booked my flight using eDreams from Singapore to Los Angeles via Xiamen and the ticket I got was as follows Singapore to Los Angeles via Xiamen (Layover 2h 35mins) Los Angeles to Singapore United (Direct Flight). I hold a valid USA visa and thus was all set to board the flight. When I reached the airport at the counter I was told by the staff that in order to take the Xiamen flight I need to have a China Visa (There is some rule where people from 7 countries in the world need to do when transiting via Xiamen). I asked the airline staff that I was not given any prompt at the time of booking nor is any such requirement mentioned on Xiamen website and on the internet however I was not helped. In order to not spoil my families vacation I bought a one way ticket to USA on another airline. I was not reimbursed for my original ticket let alone any compensation for my new booking. I've been contacting Xiamen Airlines about why is this rule not mentioned on their website as it is such a unique requirement however they're unable to respond to me properly. In their defence they're quoting the requirement of need of a visa for China for people from all over the world except for 51 specific countries if you want to transit for less than 3 days however my case is different. I just had a layover of 2 hour and 35 minutes. I am extremely disappointed and would not recommend anyone to take this airline as their staff is not helpful and neither is their customer service.==

### "I missed my flight"
Los Angeles to Manila via Xiamen. I missed my flight due to confusing schedule (12:15am), I went to the airport 3 hours within the same day (unfortunately I was told by the lady at the airline counter that I was late to my flight! And it was supposed to be there the earliest day or before midnight of that day!!). Instead of helping me by providing assistance, I was told to buy a new ticket or "Go home! I tried to talk to them but nobody helped me at all and they did not give me a chance to get the ticket rebooked/rescheduled, not even try to refund my ticket nor provided a discount for my new ticket. I will not recommend Xiamen Airline at all.

### "worst part was the layover in Xiamen"
Los Angeles to Bangkok via Xiamen. It was not the overly-friendly skies, especially on the shorter flight, but the snacks, food and beverage were OK. Another review reminded me of the barely audible English announcements (use headphones to hear it). The seats and legroom seem average. The Boeing 787 for the LAX-XMN segment is a nice, new aircraft. The entertainment system had a small selection of music and movies, which were adequate. Emirates scores better there! The website is hard to use, and changes seemed impossible. But I successfully purchased a ticket. If I purchased again, I would be certain everything is perfect before clicking Submit. I'm hesitant to call "customer service" as English is not their main language, and rules over customer satisfaction seem to be the situation. The worst part of the flight was the layover in Xiamen, China. Border control entry is required, followed by departure control. This is slow and time consuming. Re-entering security is very strict. Every passenger is wanded after passing the magnetometers. My baggage scan revealed two small Bic lighters, which were confiscated. Any lithium batteries in checked bags are likely to be removed. The airport is years behind many International airports, and is hard to spend time in. However, long layovers can qualify you for a hotel room (+5 hours), a city tour, or the lounge on the lowest level - with free Wi-Fi. The lounge was quite basic and drab. Hard to call it a "benefit". A room in the back had cots. In the airport, I was twice offered working iPhones for cash. With a landing announcement that mentions contacting quarantine if you're ill, including headaches, nausea or diarrhea, and the scrutiny upon entry and exit, I don't advise buying black market iPhones. The ticket price was very competitive. If they improved the layover experience at their airport in Xiamen, it might be worth the savings.

### "crew looked tired"
Flight left about 30 minutes late, which is much less of a delay than usual. Crew looked tired as this was an evening flight. Crew English announcements still not really understandable through PA. No comment from cockpit crew as is usual with international airlines. Extremely hard landing in HKG (no noticeable weather or turbulence). No comment from the cockpit crew again. They still have a long way to go in my opinion to be on par with international airlines. Sometimes hearing the crew's voice in understandable English (since this is an international sector) would help.

### "Such a rubbish airline"
Beijing to Xiamen. Such a rubbish airline, first they cancelled my flight without offering compensation. Then I tried to reason with their agency, they said they recommend I asked for a full refund. Is that a joke? I was at the airport and they wanted me to refund. I then insisted that I change to the other flight, which was scheduled to depart at 20:05 but we waited more than 5 hours due to air traffic control. Can't really trust the airline, especially you're dealing with state-owned airlines, and they don't obey by rules set out by international standard.

### "Boeing 787-8 was new"
Seattle to Shenzhen. Check-In was quick. Boarding commenced slightly late but was controlled and orderly. The Boeing 787-8 was new and a bit squeaky. The seat had a 17 inch width and 32-33 inches of pitch. The seat had a cup holder, remote, USB and AC power ports and a fairly large personal screen. The selection of content was decent but a lack of Western movies and appealing Eastern movies could be improved. The food served was good and a decent portion was served. The crew were quite sincere and attentive to all calls, Their English was okay for interactions but not too great over the PA.

### "delay is prolonged, unpredictable"
Quanzhou to Beijing. The airline lured us into boarding and held us in the cabin for more than a few hours. Initially, they announced the aircraft would push back to the tarmac in 10 minutes, which didn't happen. Then I confronted a member of cabin crew and he kept saying it was the tower controller who had said the plane would push back in 10 mins and then told us to wait. The lack of transparency, coupled with highly restricted air traffic by military has tarnished this airline's reputation. Never fly on Chinese domestic routes if you had a choice. The delay is prolonged, unpredictable and not compensated for.

### "English skill needs improvement"
Los Angeles to Xiamen. The flight was delayed due to unknown reason. The aircraft is relatively new, bright, clean and modern. The interior was specially decorated for this inauguration flight with LAX symbols. The crews welcomed us with big smiles and everyone gets a little gift for the inauguration flight. They personal entertainment system has a large screen, and the system worked just as I wanted without struggle. A safety card, two magazines and a menu in the pocket; a blanket and a bottle of water on the seat. But the menu missed a translation for breakfast. The food is not bad but can be improved. The crew were trying to act as friendly, but lacked some sincereness, but they did a great job. Their English skill really needs improvement. As a Chinese airline they followed the CAAC rule, which restricted people to use their laptops and other devices only when the aircraft reached cruising attitude and didn't allow passengers to switch on their phones at all. And they locked the 787 windows to a certain brightness which make them impossible to adjust by passengers. Another problem is that I had a transfer flight at XMN, but I had to pick up my luggage and recheck it again.

### "should be more transparent"
Hong Kong to Xiamen. Upon arriving at HKG airport, my gate was still unannounced. I spoke with the airline representative many times, as did other passengers, and nothing was posted on the departure board about our takeoff or a delay or any gate. Even after scheduled departure time there hadn't been any notifications of a delay. Finally, we were told which gate to go to. We boarded the plane two hours late and had to wait 30 minutes more as the flight attendant said it took that long to load the luggage (even though less than half of the plane was full). When my phone died, I asked an attendant if they could help me to charge it as I didn't know the Chinese name of my hotel in Xiamen. He refused several times until I was very persistent that it would not had died if I had not waited so long for the flight. Landing was smooth but on the way back the same issues existed, all the while announcements on the speaker mentioned how important guests were to Xiamen Airlines. I didn't feel that at all. The staff should be more transparent and clear with guests about delays and procedures, as delays of that magnitude require changes in planning and sometimes result in losses.

### "polite and helpful cabin crew"
Amsterdam to Changsha via Xiamen.I'd never heard of this airline before this trip. I have to say that I was delighted. Very polite and helpful cabin crew. Other reviewers mentioned that their English was poor, but I didn't have any difficulty. Food and drink were very good and IFE was better than I had anticipated - not great (nothing like Emirates, for example), but good, recent international films. The seat lies flat and allowed me (6 ft / 183 cm height) to stretch out comfortably. No wifi and phones have to be switched off, as per Chinese Govt rules. But using a tablet in airline mode is OK. There is an electric socket at the seat and it was enough to power my fairly large laptop. I would fly with them again. The 2nd sector was internal from Xiamen to Changsha. Once again, excellent service and good authentic Chinese food. No IFE, of course, being a short sector, so they left the TV on instead (so bring earplugs or headphones if you don't want to be bothered by it. That was the only strange aspect of the flight.

### "Service was great"
Vancouver to Ho Chi Minh via Xiamen. Sat in Business class on outbound and regular economy seats on the return. Service was great, they did not understand everything in English however they knew enough. Food was good. Seats were fine for a overseas flight.

### "communication is not maintained"
Tianjin to Fuzhou with Xiamen Airlines. The airline lured us into boarding and we were kept on the aircraft for over an hour without any announcements, which is shameful. This airline prides itself on proving the best service in China, however this has not been the case for me, the basis communication between them and passengers is not maintained, raising many questions of how any news being delivered in a transparent way.

### "friendly flight attendants"
Amsterdam to Seoul via Xiamen. I booked a flight from Amsterdam to Incheon and had never heard of Xiamen Air before. Great service, friendly flight attendants, tasty food (chose the Asion options), and modern, spacious aircraft. I had 1 very tight layover in Xiamen due to construction work at the airport. The ground staff at Incheon provided us with all necessary information and the staff at Xiamen helped us through all the security steps and got us in the airplane on time. The other layover was long (10 hrs), but they provided a free transfer lounge and free hotel stay. FYI: foreign credit cards don't work in Xiamen restaurants, so bring/exchange RMB.

### "Super cheap tickets"
Seattle to Tokyo via Shenzhen & Xiamen. Super cheap tickets, lack of information before and during trip, some airport confusion if you're really out of it or don't speak Chinese. They provide a hotel if flying all legs of trip on Xiamen Airlines with overnight layover, entertainment and food caters to Chinese tastes. I speak Mandarin, so I rate this flight a 8/10. Screaming deal of a ticket booked in 12/2016. Super nervous after receiving email in January 2017 of seat cancellation for the first leg of my trip (Seattle-Shenzhen). Customer service doesn't speak English. Got a call back in Chinese (my Chinese is ok, but not my first language) and took about 30 minutes plus another 30 minute call back to realize that the seat No I requested was cancelled and not the seat on the flight. Over next few months, received a few more e-mails stating that flight times had changed, even though they were the same as when we booked them. Still felt insecure about whether or not our trip would really happen. No online check-in for foreigners. We show up at the airport and have an easy check-in. Heard that Xiamen Air provides a hotel which the airport staff confirmed. Arrived at Shenzhen to some chaos - they separate the transfers passengers, people are confused as to where to go, but are shepherded by the Xiamen air staff. Waited about 45 minutes with several other foreigners to get my boyfriend's 24-hour transit visa which allows him to leave the airport. Disembarked at Xiamen, shepherded again by the staff to pick up our baggage. Many of the foreign passengers did not know about the hotel that Xiamen air provided us with, since we all arrived around 9pm and had connecting flights in the morning. They expected to sleep on the floor of the airport. Followed signs to the reception desk that makes lodging arrangements. Showed our passports and tickets and provided with a room at the E-Charm Hotel in Xiamen. If you are travelling alone, they will pair you with someone of the same gender. The hotel is about 10 minutes away from the airport and costs about 15 RMB one way. Although the room provided was free, we had to cover our travel expense both ways to and from the hotel. I think this is strange. If you are only going to and from the hotel, the cash machines up on level 2 allow you to take out 100 RMB. Hotel was nice for Chinese standards! Continued to Tokyo in the morning. Flights were all around ok - seats were good enough, entertainment and meals were Chinese oriented - we ordered vegetarian meals. They were stingy on the drinks and don't add ice unless you ask. Warm beers on international flights, but grab them early.

### "it was a satisfactory flight"
Dalian to Hangzhou. The plane was estimated to take off at 9:45 am, and we boarded the plane at about 9:20, then sat for one and a half hours until it took off but didn't know the reason! Other than that, all was good. The luggage rack was lit up by the blue lights and the seats were all blue which made the flight enjoyable and pleasant. The cabin crew were friendly and attentive. And the food was delicious: pork/fish rice, bread with chili sauce, cake and yogurt. All in all, it was a satisfactory flight.

### "embarrassing, stressful situation"
Vancouver to Hong Kong via Xiamen. I arrived early at the airport, before the check in booth opened. Waited in line for over an hour and chatted with other passengers in front of me during that time. When I arrived at the counter, the check in clerk asked me where did I come from. I assumed she meant something about which line so I said this line, the same one as the people you just checked in. She said that I was in the wrong line and that I had to go to the back of the other line (for the other check in booth). I wondered if she thought I had cut in line or something so I told her if she had this type of doubt she should ask the people (who were still standing next to me) if I had been in their line all the time. She refused and told me to go to the back of the other line again and then proceeded to check in the next person in line. I was the last one to check in after waiting an additional 30 - 40 minutes. By this time, it was so close to boarding that I had to run to security and then run to the boarding gate as the plane was already boarding. I had to skip going to duty free to pick up things for my friends in China as I had promised. Even though I had to use the washroom, there was no time for that. No time to grab a snack or drink. It was the most embarrassing, stressful situations I have experienced in a very long time. Actually I can't remember ever being treated like that before. The airlines bounced my complaint back and forth between the Vancouver and Xiamen offices and finally put the blame on me, saying that if I had told her which line I was in this wouldn't have happened. What nonsense. Of course I told her that but she just ignored me and refused to serve me. I can understand a company hiring a bad employee but to back that person up when they know she was wrong, is inexcusable.

### "not book a flight on this airline"
My wife and I booked a flight for May 2017 from Portland to Shenzhen via Seattle. After 2 months, Xiamen notified us that our flight from Seattle to Shenzhen had been cancelled. We had to re-book our flight with Delta at a higher price $686.00 per ticket on Xiamen vs. $891.00 per ticket on Delta or $205.00 more per ticket. Furthermore, our new flight only takes us to Hong Kong, which will cost us more even more money with van transfers and taxis. I would recommend that you not book a flight on this airline, as they are not reliable and will leave you stranded.

### "very low quality of service"
First time took direct flight from Singapore to Xiamen, horrible experience with the cabin crew as they treat everyone like prisoner, very bad service, small leg room and food was terrible, I thought return trip will be better as it will be served by other crews but the experience was pretty awful. Remember this is not low cost airline, but they provide very low quality of service, no individual display on each deck, phone must switch off even after seatbelt sign switch-off, no entertaintment for 5 hours on my last trip, only served drink for once, strongly not recommended to take this airline if situation is allowed.

### "won't be flying Xiamen again"
Vancouver to Sydney via Xiamen. I traveled with Xiamen Airlines for the first and last time over December/January. Originally flying from Sydney to Vancouver via Xiamen in December and back to Sydney Via Xiamen in January. All flights were on new Boeing 787's. The flights were extremely full, probably due to the fact it was just under $650 one way on Christmas Eve. That was probably the only appealing thing from the trip. The aircraft inside were rather dirty, finger prints and grease all over the windows, the cabin had an aweful smell as well. The seat space was okay. The inflight entertainment was updated and had a good selection. The food was nothing to get excited about, and the crew only came twice during the whole flight which is below the amount of times they come on other services I've flown between Sydney and Vancouver. The crew overall were okay, spoke hardly any English and weren't apologetic if they hit you with the trolley. The layover in Xiamen both ways was a complete nightmare - no one at the airport speaks English, and even if you are transiting immigration seem to have no idea what the process is and take a long time to process you as you have no visa. I won't be flying Xiamen again.

### "cabin smelt of cigarettes"
Bangkok to Fuzhou return. I had no idea what to expect on Xiamen Airlines. During check-in at Bangkok, The counter was empty. The lounge in Bangkok was Air France, and more than satisfactory. The boarding was orderly and not too chaotic. The purser at the door was smiling, but when I said hello, no response whatsoever. (ot even eye contact. Boarding drinks served promptly. You can't use mobile phones (Chinese law, which is silly). There was no in-flight entertainment, so I just played my iPad. The flight attendant was polite,  made eye contact and was smiling. Her attempts at speaking english were OK, she was just following the script. The previous reviews that mentioned "The meals were the same both ways" meant that both flights had the same choices. It was just a difference in entree, fish or beef. The side dishes were exactly the same. Their way of cost-cutting, I presume. After meal service, the flight attendant left a bowl of mixed nuts and my drink. The return flight was the exact opposite. Bangkok to Fuzhou sector had 30% occupancy, while the return sector had 100% occupancy. The lounge at Fuzhou airport was surprising for Chinese standards, but no alcohol! Boarding was orderly, but after take-off, a first-time flyer from the economy cabin trespassed into the business cabin and asked me  "Is this seat available? and I said no. The same unruly passenger proceeded to annoy the business class flight attendants but they dealt with him professionally. The seat was uncomfortable both ways. The Boeing 737-700 had very restrictive seating, but ample space. The Boeing 737-800 had comfortable seating, but I had to bend my head during take-off and landing since there was this bulging solid piece of rubber in the headrest. The cabin smelt of cigarettes or someone was smoking before the flight.

### "Value for money great"
Singapore to Fuzhou. Value for money great, as Xiamen Airlines is the only airline that serves this route. Ground service acceptable, most of their flight attendants can speak basic English. Seat preferred it to be a little more comfortable. Cabin Service average, offered hot towels which are too hot to touch. Food & beverages better than expected. Inflight entertainment average, offered headphones for music which was acceptable.

### "staff barely speak English"
Wuhan to Amsterdam via Xiamen. My flight was cancelled due to bad weather conditions. The company sent me an email in Chinese stating that I had to rebook my flight but without giving any option of possible different solution. Once at the airport they were surprised I was asking to be rebooked on another flight and/or reimbursed. I'm going to try to follow up on this and see if I can get something, but in general I didn't like the way they handle the problem, they didn't care about leaving people at the airport without any support. In addition both the airport and the cabin staff barely speak English, so it's very hard to communicate with them.

### "good seat pitch, up-to-date IFE"
Amsterdam to Kuala Lumpur via Xiamen. Flew with Xiamen Air and I'm really satisfied. Kind crew, sufficient command of English, good seat pitch, up-to-date IFE and choice between Chinese or Western food. What really stands out is the free hotel when your layover is more than 6 hours, your connecting flight is outside China and both flights are operated by Xiamen Air. It was well arranged, all passengers who comply with the rules were on a list and we got a confirmation in Chinese so that the taxi driver could read it. You have to pay for the taxi ride, but that is only 40 yuan. They have several hotels under contract, our first one was a 5-star hotel and the second one a 3-star. The only thing you have to do is to proceed to counter B11 (upstairs) after clearing customs.

### "impression of journey was beyond expectations"
Hong Kong to Beijing via Xiamen with Xiamen Air (MF). Xiamen Air has just started intercontinental routes. I took this itinerary, as I was interested to see their transfer service. Outbound flights from HKG to PEK via XMN was smooth. HKG to XMN was a new B738, they provide light meal for this 50min flight. XMN to PEK with Boeing 788, PTV with good selection of movies, songs. Seats are comfortable. Inflight service was good, FAs were attentive. Xiamen Air has hotel arrangement if your connection is overnight. However, the hotel is not around the airport, and the hotel did not meet a 4-star hotel standard (which is claimed). For First, Business class, Skyteam Elite, Elite plus member, they provide your own room. For Economy, you will have to share with others! XMN lounge at domestic sector meets an average standard providing Chinese cuisine, fruits and drinks, but choices at breakfast time are limited. Inbound flights from PEK to HKG via XMN with a 2-hour connection. Flight PEK-XMN was delayed and I was worried about missing my connection to HKG wihch was the last of the day. The customer service manager at PEK did a good job. Before he stepped in, I was not happy with the way they dealt with my concerns and the delay. He coordinated with his colleagues at XMN, and also prepared backup plan for me. The flight to XMN took off 2-hour behind schedule using a B757. Onboard services were good, but ground services at XMN for transfer was not very clear, a lack of guidance and communications. MF lounge at XMN international section has no added-value, small and crowed. Overall impression on this journey was above my expectations, I will definitely choose Xiamen Air again. But as a new player for transfer and intercontinental market, the service at XMN, could do better comparing to its competitors.

### "nice regional wings for Asia Pacific"
Was flying from Hangzhou to Tianjin on Xiamen Air. HGH was very foggy and the plane took off 2 hours late. During the wait in the aircraft the crew provided me with coffee as I requested and after take off to a bad weather we were experiencing turbulence 70% of the 2 hour flight. But the crew were very professional in serving and food and beverages. Xiamen Airline is a nice regional wings for Asia Pacific.

### "recommend for the budget-wary traveller"
Amsterdam to Taipei via Xiamen with Xiamen Airlines. After reading many reviews here about the transfer service in Xiamen I was a bit worried but it turned out ok. Yes, you still need to check yourself and your baggage in at Xiamen again but ground staff seem to be used to the procedure by now. In Amsterdam and in Taipei they understood they could only tag our bags to Xiamen. In Xiamen when arriving at customs it's best to have printed proof you're transferring but they have a list of transferring passengers. There's a counter for free hotel if your wait is longer than 6 hours. Don't confuse this counter with the "transfer service" counter that's right next to it, that's only for domestic transfers, I mistakingly waited in that line for some time. The hotel is 20 minutes by taxi but it's nice. One awkward thing is that they put 2 solo passengers into one room, luckily I didn't have any roommate. On the long flight both ways they ran out of coconut juice halfway. On Xiamen to Taipei they gave drinks only after the food, so you had to eat either thirsty or with cold food. On Taipei to Xiamen they didn't give any drinks at all but maybe that was because I had ordered a special meal when booking. China has some strict rules about mobile phones and power banks. On the site it says you can do online checkin if you fly from Amsterdam but I got an error when I tried, maybe that only works if you're not transferring. All in all, it's very cheap and the annoyances are not deal-breakers if you're prepared for them, so I recommend it for the budget-wary traveller.

### "ridiculous airport procedures in Xiamen"
Amsterdam to Bangkok via Xiamen with Xiamen Airlines. This airline is ridiculous and so are the airport procedures in Xiamen. Me and my boyfriend had booked a flight from Amsterdam to Bangkok via Xiamen for an insanely good price of €370. Xiamen does not allow online check in for international flights. At the baggage drop in AMS, we asked whether the luggage could be tagged to our final destination. No proper answer could be given. Finally, at the gate we were told to pick up our luggage in Xiamen and drop it off again there. The flight itself was pretty good, except for the food which had no taste at all. Horrible. This airline does not allow any mobile phones to be turned on. Not even when they are on airplane mode. They need to be switched off, and if they find out you secretly use your phone the crew will stand next to you until you switch it off. WiFi may be used on iPads and Notebooks only. After a few hours the crew handed out arrivals / departure cards and you will need them. The crew will tell you that you won't need them for transiting however, you do need them. You will be put back in line at immigration if you don't have them filled out. Every single person has to go through immigration, even when your next flight is in 30 minutes or so. The horror really started when arriving in Xiamen. The procedure is as follows: Get out of the airplane. Walk towards customs via declare or not declare route. Go through immigration (with arrivals / departure card, passport, eticket) and you will get a temporary entrance permission. Go to baggage belt and get your luggage. Put your luggage through x-ray. Take elevator one level up. Now it gets tricky. If you have a 6 hours or more transit. Proceed to (transfer service) counter B11 for a FREE hotel. You do need to pay for travel costs. The hotel was good, but checking in took 45-60 minutes, they are so slow and don't understand English. After that return to the airport to the departures floor. Proceed to Intl. departures. Put your luggage through x-ray. Now you will find the check in counters, check in your flights and luggage. Walk upstairs and go through immigration (hand over your departures card and passport). Go through hand luggage check (they have very strict rules for power banks). If the power bank itself doesn't show its capacity it will be thrown away. No argument possible. Now proceed to the gate to your airplane that will bring you to your next destination. Never I will fly with Xiamen Airlines again. It is cheap, but that's probably all positive about it (and the free transit hotel).

### "food was fantastic"
Flew from Sydney to Fuzhou. Food was fantastic, some meals had both Chinese and Western choices, such as fried rice or pasta. Seat can be reclined. You are free to roam after seat belt signs are off. Toilets are pretty clean but flushing was unpleasant. You are not allowed to use mobile devices, or tablet devices however laptops and computers can be used but need to turn off WIFI. Entertainment included popular movies, a kids section, brief history, games section, CCTV report on the airline, and adult sections. There were also maps provided and the shopping all on PTV. There were several drinks services of juices and soft drinks. PTV is provided in 5 languages - Chinese, English, French, Japanese and Korean. Flight attendants are pleasant but tend to be a little annoyed if you call them when they are serving another passenger.

### "most of the crew were pleasant"
Flew Hangzhou to Singapore with Xiamen Airlines. For a Chinese airline, I was rather pleased that the plane departed on time. Most of the crew were pleasant but one or two stewardess did not have a smile on their faces. Food was served and was pleasant enough. We were also given a packet of nuts and a bottle of water 2/3 into our flight. I wouldn't mind taking this flight again although there was one issue that perplexed me. Apparently ipads, laptops, tablets could be used during the flight, but mobile phones were not allowed. I honestly think this is rather stupid since a mobile phone works just like an ipad/tablet. The inflight entertainment is but a pathetic small TV that one can barely see what is being shown, and only Chinese movies were played.

### "roundtrip ticket only 350 Euro"
Booked a Xiamen Airlines roundtrip ticket from Amsterdam to Jakarta via Xiamen for only 350 Euro. Everything was great, I loved the meal, the staff were very helpful, the seat was comfortable and I had a good sleep during the flight. The entertainment was proper but some movies have no subtittle. The flight had no Wifi connection.

### "transferring in Xiamen was ridiculous"
My family and I travelled from Beijing To Taipei Songshan (TSA), and Taipei TPE to Beijing, both times with Xiamen Airlines in Economy class. The Good - compared to other Chinese airlines, we found the food and drinks service to be much better. The legroom on the Boeing 787 from PEK to XMN and vice-versa was very good, and the staff were friendly. An OK selection of IFE was provided on the 787 including a range of English speaking movies and many games. On 3 of the 4 flights the kids were handed an activity pack which they enjoyed playing (for about 10 minutes). The Bad - legroom on the 737 between Xiamen and Taiwan was poor. Transferring in Xiamen in both directions was ridiculous. When we checked in at Beijing, our bags were tagged through to Taipei, however we were advised that we had to go to a separate counter at Xiamen to get our boarding passes for the flight from Xiamen to Tiapei. It was not easy to find where this was once we got to Xiamen, there were no instructions nor staff to assist. Once we found the counter we were told that it didn’t open until 2 hours before the flight (we had a 3 hour layover), and there was nowhere available to sit and wait. Taking this in our stride, it was like a “red rag to a bull” when as soon as we boarded the flight to Taipei they showed us a video promoting how good Skyteam was, with their “Seamless transfer service”. It was worse when returning from Taipei. The bags could only be tagged to Xiamen, and boarding passes could only be provided to Xiamen. There was no specific transfer facility for connecting passengers that we could use to re-check bags onwards to Beijing, and no instructions whatsoever provided to assist in the transfer. Fortunately we live in mainland China so could find our way around the system, however it would have been utterly confusing for passengers who had never been to China before, with no assistance provided. If Xiamen Airlines has aspirations of being a true regional and international player, it needs to revisit its transfer services through Xiamen and replicate those of other successful airlines in performing transfers. Its part-parent airline China Southern does a dramatically better job handling passengers through Guangzhou.

### "meals were exactly the same"
Flew from Amsterdam to Tokyo via Xiamen on Xiamen Airlines. No seat reservation or online check-in is possible with this airline. The KLM ground staff were unaware of the transit procedure in XMN. They told us to tag our bags to NRT but apparently it had to be picked up in XMN to be checked-in again. The flight on the Dreamliner to XMN was good. Loadfactor about 40% so a whole row of seats for myself. Food was served 1 hour after takeoff and 5 hours after takeoff. On both services meals were exactly the same. Didn't see the crew for the last 5 hours of the flight. Entertainment system had hiccups all the time and wifi was not available on frame B-2769. Flight was on time. Transfer procedure at XMN is troublesome. Crew on the plane told us not to fill out the immigration form since we were only transiting. At the immigration we were send back to the end of the queue to fill out the immigration form. We also had to deliver a paper version of the ticket with our names to the immigration which we did not have. They didn't thrust the itinerary in the CheckMyTrip app. After a lot of discussion they provided us the 24-hours visa for China. Don't follow the signs to the departure hall immediately if you have a long layover. The check-in desks are located in a secure area without any restaurants or shops. Check-in was opened 2 hours before departure and we couldn't get back to other parts of the airport from security. So waiting on some steel couches for a few hours without anything to do. The flight to NRT on an old and worn B738 was delayed for 90 minutes. Sitting on the tarmac without air-conditioning for 60 minutes. No reason for the delay was given. Food was good on this flight however. I had a bad experience on the flight from NRT to XMN. It was said to be a non smoking flight, but not for the crew. All of a sudden the seatbelt signs went on without any obvious reason and the smell of cigarette smoke appeared from the air-conditioning system. After 5 minutes the smell of smoke disappeared and the fast seatbelt sign was switched off again. This happened 3 times on the 4 hour flight. Having learned from my previous transfer at XMN, it went smoother this time. Altough not possible to buy food at XMN since creditcards were not accepted and the ATM's were out of order. The flight to AMS on the 787 was packed this time. Chinese people carry lots of hand luggage so overhead bins filled up quickly. I skipped the first meal because I wanted to sleep. The flight did arrive on time in Amsterdam.

### "they provided a free hotel "
Amsterdam from Taipei with 11 hours layover in Xiamen. They provided a free hotel accommodation for passengers with a long layover at Xiamen. The 737-800 has a newer interior than the one I was in on my way to Taipei. The Boeing 787 the same as the one on my way to Taipei. Both flights were on time. We had a constant turbulence on the first couple hours on the second leg of my journey, so the meal service was suspended accordingly. The flight attendants acted quickly as soon as we flew in a clean air again and resumed the meal service. There were a significant number of babies/toddlers on the flight to Amsterdam and most of them were crying and screaming constantly. Airlines should limit the amount of babies/toddlers on board for long haul flights. Simply unfair for the other 200+ passengers. It must also be a torture for those kids too.

### "787 lavatories very cramped"
Amsterdam to Taipei via Xiamen. Flown for the first time with this airline, good seating and IFE system. The food was tasty and abundant. Fight attendants are professional and worked efficiently. Both flights were on time. My luggage couldn't be checked through all the way to Taipei, so I had to collect my luggage at Xiamen and check in again. This means twice immigration procedures and twice security checks, queueing and waiting at Xiamen. Quite unnecessary on 2016 standard. The lavatories on their 787 were very cramped. I am 5'7" and barely could turn around without hitting anything. The lavatories were kept reasonably clean during the flight. The 737-800 had a simple and old interior but sufficient for a short last leg of my journey.

### "couldn't book a seat beforehand"
Amsterdam to Taipei via Xiamen. This Xiamen Airlines flight wasn't fully booked so we could pick out our own seats. The seats were comfortable, inflight entertainment had a lot of movies. The cabin crew was nice. What I disliked though was that you couldn't book a seat beforehand and thus had to rely on luck to get a good seat. Also, they didn't transfer my baggage directly, so once in Xiamen, I had to get my baggage and check out, and then check my baggage in again. In Amsterdam they seemed unaware that they were unable to transfer my baggage automatically, so I had to wait for a long time to get some answers, and nearly was late for my flight.

### "horror of a 12 hour flight"
Xiamen to Amsterdam with Xiamen Airlines, and the horror of a 12 hour flight. Food was terrible, entertainment system with no function, and the toilet like a railway station and dirty. Here I would rather not go to the bathroom. The staff was completely overstressed. The only positive thing I can say, the flight was on time. Never again with this airline.

### "very good service"
Flew Xiamen Airlines from Beijing to Hong Kong via Xiamen. Provided a very good service. I had the opportunity to fly in its newest aircraft, the Boeing 787 Dreamliner which had very comfortable seats, a complete entertainment system and a beautiful cabin. I was surprised that good food was served on a domestic flight (PEK-XMN). The cabin crew was very attentive and professional. My next flight from Xiamen to Hong Kong was operated by a Boeing 737-800. The flight was delayed for two hours, so that wasn't good. Anyway, the crew were very attentive and good food was also served.

### "the meal was poor"
Xiamen Airlines, Fuzhou to Taipei on a B737-800. No entertainment system, leg room is the smallest of any airline I have flown. The meal was poor - no taste in a lunchbox with no tray. The drink (red bean juice) was served when the meal is done. The staff are at least polite.

### "a mixed bag"
Xiamen to Amsterdam. Bit of a mixed bag. The food and seat comfort were quite decent but a few other issues would make me think before travelling with Xiamen Airlines again. Cabin crew had very limited English to the point they didn't understand the "word" vegetarian when they came around with the meal. The cabin temperature fluctuated greatly on the flight and to make matters worse, I was sat next to overweight passenger who smelt strongly of alcohol and had no concept of personal space. After he had elbowed me for about the 10th time, I decided to look for another seat but by now everyone was sleeping and simply decided to stick it out. I could have asked one of the crew but given their level of English, I thought better of it. The economy seats have UK style power sockets so useful for laptops as the inflight entertainment is somewhat limited although the screen and entertainment system was quick with none of the usual lags I have experienced on other airlines.

### "seats not very comfortable"
Flew Xiamen Airlines from Singapore to Hangzhou and back. Crew were generally helpful, however there was one male flight attendant who was exceptionally rude. Note that mobile phones cannot be used throughout the flight (even in airplane mode), as this is China Aviation Authority ruling. Food is acceptable. The cabin seats are not very comfortable. Xiamen Airlines is not recommended for medium or long haul flights.

### "crew was very unhappy"
I have flown Xiamen Airlines over the last year 2 to 3 times per month. The last three flights have been horrible. My last from Xiamen to Singapore was 2.5hrs late taking off. The airline held the aircraft because an incoming connecting fly was late. That's just wrong. The food was horrible and no water service. The cabin crew was very unhappy and not very helpful. I will do best not to fly on Xiamen Airlines again.

### "premium price for no class airline"
Kuala Lumpur to Fuzhou with Xiamen Airlines, and paid premium price for no class airline. Delays on outward and return flight. Food was quite poor and served in paper boxes. Same menu there and back and same lack of taste! Inflight entertainment was non-existant and the cabin crew were rushed and at times sounded like giving orders. Seats were not comfortable and not much different from many low cost carriers. Departure at Fuzhou was a mess and almost every bag needed to be manually checked. You would imagine that the counter staff could speed things up by giving advice on China's special baggage rules. Note - do not pack your powerbank and certain electrical items in your luggage!

### Xiamen Airlines customer review
Jakarta to Changsha via Xiamen on May 27 2014 on MF 868 and MF 8504. Crew service was very inconsistent especially on Jakarta to Xiamen leg The male crew seemed rude and unhappy however the return flights to Jakarta on June 3 2014 were fine on both legs (Changsha to Jakarta via Fuzhou) on MF 8470 and MF 869. The purser on MF 869 was very helpful. I do not understand why their service is pretty inconsistent. No PTV and feel pretty bored especially for 4-5 hours flights. Meal presentation looked awful but the food was edible. They should improve by staff smiling more better entertainment and better food presentation.

### Xiamen Airlines customer review
Dalian to Kuala Lumpur via Xiamen. I might have rated it more positively if this first time of mine to travel with them was a domestic flight. It felt like a domestic flight to me in all dimensions. You are not allowed to check in online or select seat before trip no matter how much you pay for the ticket. What's worse the first segment (domestic) of the flight opens its check-in 1.5 hrs before it opens for int'l passengers (they can check in even earlier online) so the 5 of us we were almost given seats far apart. When passing immigration at Dalian you felt it was quite informal. And then you pass a formal immigration at Xiamen again. Equipment was B738 what you may not expect to sit in for seven plus hours. Seat pitch was no different than any domestic. No PTV poor TV programme. Dinner was OK coming with bread pickled snack and fruit. Cabin crew not as good as they boasted themselves to be and did nothing to stop a Dalian tour group from talking the whole route and running up and down the cabin to annoy other passengers. This particular flight I took MF831 was not punctual as usual. I wouldn't recommend anyone to try Xiamen int'l flight.

### Xiamen Airlines customer review
SIN-XMN return. Basically a domestic airlines. Food quality very basic poor inflight entertainment. Worst of all no smiles on the faces of the cabin crew. Not up to standard for international flight.

### Xiamen Airlines customer review
Beijing-Xiamen on Dec 18 first time with Xiamen Airlines. Old B737-700 but clean and well-maintained. On-time departure and arrival. During the 3hrs flight delicious hot lunch and several rounds of beverages served they even served peanuts after lunch and mints before landing! Friendly and efficient cabin crew well-done Xiamen Airlines!

### Xiamen Airlines customer review
Flew PEK-FOC and back. Took the early morning flight which are always on time. Served a biscuit and some snacks for breakfast. Only problem was that the entertainment was in English only. Tickets were cheap and cabin crew were ok. I would choose this airline over China Southern or Eastern.

### Xiamen Airlines customer review
From Shanghai to Xiamen. The flight was delayed one hour due to air traffic control. Served pork with rice. 2 hours flying time. Not bad.

### Xiamen Airlines customer review
SHA-XMN: typical Chinese airline product. Tight seat pitch. Peanuts and a drink were given on the 2 hour evening flight whereas China Eastern provides a hot meal. Drop down screen showed a Chinese TV show. FAs were efficient but not particularly friendly. There is nothing to distinguish Xiamen Airlines from the other Chinese airlines so book by schedule.

### Xiamen Airlines customer review
Hong Kong-Xiamen. Pleasant aircraft interior although looks old on the outside. Great snack box on only a 1 hour flight. Cabin attendants courteous and well presented.

### Xiamen Airlines customer review
Wuhan-Chengdu in Y class. Check in was fine at Wuhan airport group check in counter staff friendly and efficient. Flight delayed 2 hours dinner was distributed at terminal which was tasty and I was impressed with the quality. Boarding was fast and staff were holding a sign to switch off the mobile phone. Smooth 2 hrs flight and no drama. Cabin crew friendly and helpful. All in all it was uneventful flight and will try this airline again in the future.

### Xiamen Airlines customer review
HKG-XMN-HKG. Both legs fairly new 737 seat room and cleanliness ok. Substantial hot meal served for a 50 minute flight. First leg on time smooth flight crew spoke only poor English but were friendly enough. Good attention to safety where mobile phones and seat belts are concerned. Return flight delayed 6 hours due to weather. Boarding 3 hours late followed by another 2 hours wait on plane (food and drinks served) then another hour almost in HKG while waiting for a gate.

### Xiamen Airlines customer review
Xiamen-Xian with stop over. On time good and fast check-in 737-800 new aircraft only tiny refreshment for a 4 hours flight. Very efficient service at stop over (Wuhan) good leg room clean aircraft.

### Xiamen Airlines customer review
Hangzhou to Xi'an. My First internal flight in China crews smartly dressed with professional service. Tasty dinner with large portions for Economy Class. Cabin crew walked through with sign showing no mobile phones to be used inflight was rather unique. Look forward to flying with them again.

### Xiamen Airlines customer review
Took MF for multiple flights within and also to/from China: TPE-XMN-KWL-XMN-WUS-XMN-TPE. I think only 2 of them were on-time the rest seemed delayed due to XMN's single-runway capacity limitations. I'd complain more about the food but it seemed comparable to what I got in UA economy on my transpacific flights and MF's trail mix/preserved kumquat dual-pack bettered UA's pretzel stick crumbs. Service was average airport check-in was above average as their hub is fairly well designed although crowded.

### Xiamen Airlines customer review
Xiamen-Hong Kong (connecting to an international flight to US). Check-in process fine but had to convince ticket agent to book my bags all the way to Austin TX and not just LA. He finally did. In Hong Kong I only had 1 hour to connect to my other flight. Had no idea this was a 'tight' connection until I de-planed and was met at gate by a Xiamen agent who informed me that I was a 'distressed' passenger. She ran me through the airport to get to the check in counter in time. Then she took me through staff security line (so i could avoid the long line) and got me to my gate with a few mins to spare. Flight was comfortable.

### Xiamen Airlines customer review
Qingdao-Xiamen and Xiamen-Chongqing in Economy. My original flight on Shangdong Airlines was cancelled and I was rebooked on Xiamen Airlines. TAO-XMN was delayed by two hours due to air traffic congestion meaning we arrived 0140. Food was acceptable for two hour flight. Service friendly. Tried coconut juice for the first time. Aircraft generic B737 clean IFE consisted of a Chinese flick on flip down screens. Luggage arrived quickly. Second leg similar no delays reasonable food good service. As with other Chinese airlines their English announcements can be a bit 'Chinglish' making them hard to understand.

Xiamen-Hangzhou: early morning departure clean plane on time departure good service and friendly attendants offering a tasteless snack.

Hong Kong-Xiamen. Boeing 737 in Business Class. Good service and an on-time flight. FAs were attentive but struggled with basic English. Seats comfortable and quite large. Food was OK.

I fly at least once a week Xiamen Airline - it started with good service few years ego and then go down. Now the service is poor and staff are not friendly like before and sometime arrogant. The food is also poor.

Guangzhou - Xiamen - Guangzhou. Overall a decent experience. Flights on time staff attitude very good and a well kept 757-200. Lots of drinks on the outward journey albeit with a very basic seaweed snack (!) and the same good service on the return leg (this time with pizza and buns for the meal).

Kuala Lumpur to Fuzhou (monopoly operator for the route) was rather chaotic. The flight attendants were fairly rude which may be attributed to the number of passengers who did not follow rules during take-off and landing. However this is no excuse for the appalling level of service (or lack of). FAs impatient and unhelpful by international standards. Generally this is expected from a Chinese domestic operator except the price was even higher than flights going the same distance to other Chinese cities.

Ground crew at Xiamen Airport pleasant and efficient but FAs inflight were not good. They seem to do the minimum required and act as if they don't really care about the passengers. I was horrified to see people carrying really enormous sacks into the cabin on their backs. Unbelievable. What ever happened to the concept of hand-carry luggage?

Shanghai to Xiamen. The staff were friendly and the flight was fine in general. However if you are over 5' tall DO NOT take a window seat. There is no leg room whatsoever. I'm 5'8" and wished I'd learned how to say 'aisle-seat' before check-in as it was an incredibly uncomfortable journey made even worse when the person in front tipped there seat back. If I'd had an aisle seat I think it would have been fine though so be warned!

Leaving Shenzhen to Fuzhou on 19 Sep (MF 8318) and return on 21 Sep (MF8317) both filghts delayed for at least more than 2 hours. Missed the conference meetings and dinners appointment on both occasions. It is surely a frustrated experience. Why can't they have more competition by opening out more airlines servicing between these two cities? Do we customers need to go through their incompetence operations and their internal problems? By the way the tickets are not cheap Rmb1060 one way.

Return Shanghai-Xiamen in economy. Both fairly full flights in Boeing 757. Seat pitch OK for a 1.30 hour or so flight. So is the inflight service. Friendly FA's and a simple lunch box accompanied by non- alcoholic drinks. Uneventful but OK. On the way back we pulled back but stood still for a long time after that. No explanation but when FA's found out that it could take a while they started giving service to passengers. Quite professional.

I would like to say " Thank You" to Ms Hou Gui Xia who was on duty on 17.05.05 in GuangZhou XiaMen airline counter. My aged parents were travelling on their own from Melbourne to Guang Zhou to catch the same day flight to Xiamen. As the time was very tight between the two flights I worried that they would be late for the flight to Xiamen. Ms Hou was very patient and helpful every time I called to check if my parents had come to pick up the tickets. She also put my parents on phone so that we could exchange a few words. It is very kind and thoughtful of her to do so. It gave us a lot of comfort . Her attitude towards passengers create a good image for Xiamen airline. At the same time I would like to suggest that you add aged passengers service. As far as I know a lot of aged parents are travelling on their own. It is harder when transit is involved. Wouldn't that be wonderful if you have a service to pick up the aged parents for their worrying children and help them through all the airport procedure till they board on the next flight. I believe people are more than willing to pay for the service.

I flew from Shanghai to Wuyi Shan in Fujian province. Service was basic but comfortable nonetheless. Flight attendants made a number of announcements during the hour flight. Chinese newspapers were given out. Drinks were served as well as two bags of pretzels and plums.

### Xiamen Airlines customer review
Excellent full service airline for the price in between no frills and major airlines like SQ. The food and service is similar to SilkAir on comparable flight from Xiamen/Sing.

### Xiamen Airlines customer review
Singapore to Fuzhou from Fuzhou to ShenZhen and back lastly to Singapore. I must say that the treatment on international flight was better than domestic. Quality of food was average and need to be improved to cater to international standards however based on its low cost no frills fare I will chose Xiamen the next time I go to China. Pre-booking your departure 4-5 days earlier is recommended.

### Xiamen Airlines customer review
I flew Xiamen from Macau to Hangzhou I have never flown on such a dreadful airline. The food was unidentifiable the service of drinks was: coke water or beer and the cabin crew's professionalism basically amounted to "sit still and shut up" . However topping it all were the hordes and hordes of passengers that all ran to the exits in preparation to disembark as soon as we began to touch down... they all went flying (excuse the pun).

### Xiamen Airlines customer review
Chinese airlines companies need a huge revamp including Xiamen Airlines. I have flown with Xiamen Airlines on several occasions and only have done so under duress. Their service and food are very ordinary and they do little to make their customers satisfied. Just today my wife is due to return to Guangzhou from Fuzhou. Her flight has once again been delayed - the excuse this time is that they cant find a pilot!

### Xiamen Airlines customer review
I travelled from Shanghai to Xiamen and back on Xiamen Airlines and was pleasantly surprised by the friendly service both there and back and the high quality food on the return evening flight. Compared to other domestic airlines in China Xiamen Airlines was a good experience.
