### "customer service was terrible"
The airline cancelled our 11am flight 2 hours before takeoff, we had already arrived at the airport. The flight was still leaving at 11 the airline decided to downgrade the size of the plane. They offered 11 euros voucher for a 9 hour wait until the next flight was leaving. The customer service was terrible, avoid flying with this airline wherever you can.

### “all our flights have been delayed”
We booked with Finnair because we've appreciated the quality of this company for almost a decade. Turns out that most of their recent flights are operated by Wideroe. On all our flights operated by Wideroe, all our flights have been delayed and this time was the worst. We had a short connection in Finland to get us to our holiday destination. The Wideroe flight departed 40 min late when the boarding started on time! We had to run to our gate and barely made it. Our luggages didn't and they only managed to get our luggages to our hotel on the 3rd day when there were flights to that destination everyday... We had to buy a whole new set of clothes and a new luggage to bring those clothes back, on top of losing time going shopping for clothes. I will stop using Finnair for SAS. I don't want to take the risk of ending up on another Wideroe flight.

### " Wonderful customer service"
Not Verified |  Wonderful customer service. Great staff at the airport and on the plane. Even better, we needed to make changes to our flight and the customer service centre responded to a web enquiry within 15 minutes at 11 o'clock at night on a Friday. Simple and easy to deal with and a very comfortable clean aircraft.

### "avoid and fly SAS"
Not Verified | Wideroe is honestly the WORST airline ever. Please note that this review is about my experience but all around us in Tromso people where very unhappy with them. On the way to Tromso from Bergen we immediately noticed that de plane was very small. Average sized people do not fit the chairs or seatbelts. Its very uncomfortable. Because of the small seats people lean in the pathway. Unfortunately the staff does not take this in to account to if you happen to sit on an aisle seat: you will be pushed around during the round of coffee. On the way back our flight time changed. No text or email. We just happened to check the app. It changed 4 HOURS. Which made our transfer window not 5.5 hours but 1.5. Wideroe didn't seem to care about all the people with transfers and took there time. We left with 30 minutes delay. They didn't inform us about if we would make our transfer, what our gate would be or anything. Also: before check-in on the way back they informed us they were overbooked by 1 person and offered only 150 to a volunteer to fly THE NEXT DAY. If nobody volunteered they would force someone of the plane. Upon boarding there were multiple Wideroe employees already boarded and seated in passenger seats. No wonder it was overbooked. All in all, avoid and fly SAS.

### "Avoid Wideroe"
Not Verified |  The flight was fine. I learned later that I could have booked it through SAS which is what everyone should do. I mistakenly paid for extra baggage i thought I was paying for but it turns out that this was included. I found the site confusing and so made a mistake. When I learned about this at the Oslo airport, no one at the the desk could correct the problem and they told me to contact customer service via chat or email. At Leknes I did contact, I was told it was company policy that you could not cancel an add on service. They would not evn let me cancel the unnecessary and what will be unused charge for the January 31 flight back to Oslo. Turns out the flight was joint with SAS and I used their app for boarding pass anyway. Book through SAS and get good service. Avoid Wideroe

### "a lot of delays"
Bergen to Oslo. I am very disappointed with this airline. There is a lot of delays due to which me and my wife have to face many different issues. I will never suggest my friend or my family to take the flight through this airline. If we take a flight through this airline we wont know how many delays there will be there and how many problems should we face.

### "I waited nearly an hour to get my checked bag"
I waited nearly an hour to get my checked bag from the carousel. Someone could have walked each individual bag from the plane faster. I missed my next flight because this airline doesn't know how to move a bag from a plane to a carousel.

### "worst airline I've ever flown"
Quite simply, the worst airline I've ever flown. Flew four times with them in August 2022. All delayed. Substantially. Last one, Bodø to Stavanger had a 12 hours delay, no information, no announcement, passengers left in dark, tense atmosphere amongst passengers. Had to leave security area, queue at check in for meal coupon if 150 krona which didn't het you much. Check in staff totally indifferent. And their tickets aren't cheap. They've monopoly on some routes. Unfortunately your have to use them for some routes in Northern Norway. Flight itself, cramped seats, unfriendly cabin crew - all of that i wouldn't mind if they arrive in time,  and not 12 hours late

### "choose another company if possible"
The boss at Kjevik airport need more experience about customer services.. Rude and don't listen if u complain or need help. I Will choose another company if possible.

### "Handles the current strike very poorly"
Not Verified |  Handles the current strike very poorly. There is extremely little information. We were worried about the strikes but got no info that any flight would be canceled the same day so we went to the airport. Once there, the gate will not appear on the screen until about 20 minutes before the flight is to leave. Then the flight is delayed 1h. Finally, half the airline is canceled 10 minutes before departure. Then about 30 minutes later the other half. O.m we and other travelers could get info earlier at least in the morning the same day we could have booked a train or similar to take us home / to our destination. But since we do not get any info, we lose at least one day on travel / miss important scheduled meetings etc. The staff does not know much more and we are referred to check our mobile phones to get information about hotels. Do not recommend! Hanterar den rådande strejken mkt dåligt. Det är extremt lite information. Vi var oroliga för strejkerna men fick ingen info om att något flyg skulle vara inställt samma dag så vi åkte in till flygplatsen. Väl där kommer inte gaten upp på skärmen förrän ca 20 min innan flyget skall gå. Sen blir flyget försenat 1h. Sist blir halva flygsällskapet avbokat 10 min innan avgång. Därefter ca 30 min senare övriga halvan. O.m vi och andra resenärer kunde få info tidigare i alla fall på morgonen samma dag hade vi kunnat boka tåg eller liknande för att ta oss hem/till vårt resmål. Men eftersom vi inte får någon info så förlorar vi minst en dag på att resa/missar viktiga inplanerade möten etc. Personalen vet inte så mkt mer och vi hänvisas till att kolla på våra mobiltelefoner för att få information om hotell. Rekommenderar inte!

### "Customer service is zero!"
Possibly the worst airline I have had the misfortune to use. Delayed over 12 hours on outbound journey. No ground staff to greet us and walked aimlessly around an airport asking for help. Had to take 3 flights the following day to get to our destination. Customer service is zero! Will never use this airline again.

### "Rude and incompetent customer service"
Rude and incompetent customer service. I had a question regarding one of their policies and not only did they talk down to me like I'm a child, they gave me false information (I checked later with their cabin crew). Everyone I know who's had the displeasure of dealing with Widerøes customer service have had roughly the same experience. It's a shame because they sometimes provide one of the cheaper flights in Norway, but I'd rather pay an extra 10% to avoid this company. The trip itself was ok.

### "not reimbursing the customers"
Not Verified |  Norwegian government closed the borders, but the company insists in acting at least immorally. Since tourist cannot enter the country, we cannot fly internally, and the company is not reimbursing the customers. Weird way to make money. In these moments we see how certain companies keep their ethical standards.

### "definitely do not recommend"
Bergen to Tromso. I had a flight the past 18 March (my honeymoon) and due to obvious reasons I could not travel to Tromso and I tried sending a lot of emails to the airline. They were not helpful at all and they do not refund the money. Every airline in the world is helping customers in every way they can by giving vouchers for another flight or even doing full refunds. But Wideroe doesn't seem to see that there is a world pandemic going around and decided to not change at all their policies. I will never use this airline in my life, and I definitely do not recommend it to anyone!

### "not received the reimbursement"
Not Verified |  We arrived on time for our flight from Bergen to Tromso, but were paged by the desk and advised that the flight was full and they would reimburse us a set amount per ticket if we took the later flight. We agreed and filled out the paperwork. After we were back home in the US, when I had not heard from Wideroe or received reimbursement, I filled out their online form and was contacted advising me that there was some information missing from the form I filled out in the airport, and they would see that the reimbursement was processed right away. It has been about a month and I still have not received the agreed-upon reimbursement. The flight itself was fine, but we would not have agreed to fly later if it were not for the offer of money back.

### "Completely disappointing experience"
Completely disappointing experience! Our flight WF 623 was due to depart on 10.30 am from Tromso and to reach Bergen on 12.30pm. But the flight got delayed for 45 minutes to depart on 11.15 am. At 10.45, the aircraft arrived and we were informed the boarding would proceed as soon as possible. But a staff announced there would be further delay around 30 minutes at least due to technical problem. I saw several staff or engineering crew did something on the plane right engine. Later on, we were informed the flight will be delayed (again!) until further notice. Finally we got called to board on 12.30 pm (seemed like a good news, right?). As the plane was approaching the runway, the pilot announced the aircraft needed to return to base and unable to fly. We were diverted to flight on 17.00 and thank you Wideroe for your excellent service and top notch aircraft we could finally spend our another beautiful day at the beautiful Tromso airport for 6 hours and wasted our Bergen day. And hey, thanks for the free meal coupon! Props to Wideroe! My suggestion: buy a Boeing or Airbus, ok? Not an Embraer

### "complete waste of time"
I have been travelling from United States to visit Norway. After a stay at Tromso, I planned to visit Bergen for 1 day. I had planned my day accordingly as next I was leaving for Oslo. Being winter, day ends at 4.00pm. With my original timings I was reaching Bergen at 12.30pm but instead flight did not take off until 12.30pm from Tromso. This is super disappointing and annoying as now by the time I will reach Bergen, most of the tourist attractions will be closed. Please never book Wideroe if you are travelling from long distance and tight on our schedule. Not worth it putting so much money and complete waste of time.

### "cabin crew were nice"
First time I flew with Widerøe, did not know what to expect. The cabin crew were nice and safety demonstration good. Flying these small Dash 8 aircraft was actually not so bad, I've just been flying A320 and A321's so a small Dash8-Q400 was actually not so bad. 2x2 seats. Not much legroom for those who are 185cm and beyond. Seat do recline and quite much so that was no problem. The 400 series of Dash8 is noise regulated so inside, the propeller noise were not that bad and loud. Flying on short 50 minute flights you get a coffee. You just have enough time to drink that coffee and then they'll come and collect your waste. Landed before ETA, and left on time. The pilots also talked during the flight which can help people who are maybe a bit afraid to fly. Will fly with them again.

### Wideroe customer review
Booked whole itinerary from their website; flew Wideroe from Kirkesnes to Batsfjord return with two very short layovers. Good cabin crew with smiles safety features and cockpit announcements both in Norwegian and in English. Leather seats seat pitch varies free choice of seat. Buy on board menu and a toilet use for short flights only when plane is landed for a 15 min layover according to flight schedule. All in all professional flight experience. Also security checks in the airport made me feel comfortable and were handled professionally. Make sure that you book all flights to one itinerary as there might be cancellations due to bad weather in Northern Norway. Wideroe will then rebook you to next day flight and provide an accommodation.

### Wideroe customer review
I travelled with Wideroe from Bergen airport in Norway to Aberdeen on 16th April 2014. The check-in is managed by SAS and was very swift and efficient. The check-in staff were very pleasant and welcoming and made small talk which was a nice start to my journey. Wideroe use a Dash aircraft on this relatively short flight across the North Sea to Scotland. The gate staff were very efficient and this was more than matched by 2 superb cabin crew members who worked very hard and offered tea and coffee and a small snack in the form of a muffin. The seats were very comfortable. The downside for me is that my seat appeared to have been changed from the seat I had picked online. I ended up next to the engines and as a result I could not see much. The interior of the aircraft was spotlessly clean and good information was given during the flight. I will certainly consider using this airline again in the future.

### Wideroe customer review
Bodoe-Bergen with Dash very good staff - friendly and polite crossed the south Norwegian mountains landscape and take off perfect just quite noisy with this kind of aircraft.

### Wideroe customer review
Stokmarknes to Tromsø on Dash 8-100. My flight (40 min) was a part of a seven-leg evening journey from Bodø to Vadsø in bad weather conditions. Aircraft arrived to Stokmarknes already with 40-minute delay. The only flight attendant was absolutely the frendliest one I've ever met - her smile and attitude made everybody forget about the delay. Pilots excused for the delay twice. As warm mineral water was inaccessible in the trolley FA gave me her own. To sum up: very cosy atmosphere on board. Widerøe is the only significant regional carrier in Norway but does its best to satisfy passengers.

### Wideroe customer review
Tromsø to Kirkenes via Vadsø and Vardø was a funny experience. Dash 8-100 with 37 seats was occupied with 24 passengers for the first leg. Flight attendant was very charming and smiling at every passenger while announcing and demonstrating the security equipment (well on this plane there was no place for her to hide). Short after take off she prepared her little trolley in front of the cabin and then started the "food for purchase" service as usual on Widerøe. Bought a reindeer (!) sandwich and a coke which was an adquate snack. 20 of the passengers left in Vadsø and we had a 30 min stop. Before we continued we were asked if we would like to see the security information once again. Nobody had a need for this and so we departed. The 15 min hop to Vardø was beautiful because we did fly just a some hundred foot above the ground and the sights were spectacular. The other three passengers left the aircraft in Vardø and another passenger joined us. So we were two for the hop to Kirkenes and we got a very personal security briefing which was different from the usual standard phrases. Don't get shocked if it seems that the life vest strangulates you. That's because you should not slip out". Hop to Kirkenes was 20 min and the farewell was the most personal I ever received on an air trip.

### Wideroe customer review
Don't understand the comment below  cause on international flights wideroe use 2 or 3 year old planes dash 8 Q 400. Wideroes oldest planes are used in domestic flights and was delivered in 1994-98. wideroe is not a low-cost airline but the service is very good. but would be nice with free beverages and meals but this disappeared when SAS bought the company. Traveled from Copenhagen to Torp but because of fog and missing cabincrew (caused by the fog) the plane was 2 hours late but so were all other planes too. While waiting Wideroe gave a coupon worth 10$ to every passenger to be used for fooddrink or snack in the airports shops.

### Wideroe customer review
Air Wideroe from CPH to Torp to Stavanger. Bit of a long trek on a slightly ageing Dash turboprop aircraft. No food or drink unless you buy it but friendly enough. Not sure that this is the way to travel for a long flight but Ok for short hops.
