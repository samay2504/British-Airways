### "they are a ripoff company"
Not Verified |  Guayaquil to Ft Lauderdale. We had a flight on April 6th for $258, twice what it should be. Just got a notice that the rate which was guaranteed with no additional costs is now $508 - $1000 to go to Ft Lauderdale which JetBlue would charge $128 x 2 $256. Do not fly this airline, they are a ripoff company.

### "Avoid them at all costs"
Do not fly with this company. I booked a flight from Lago Agrio to Quito for the morning of March 6. From Quito, I had connecting flights to Panama and then to Los Angeles, leaving at 2pm. On March 3rd, while I was on a bus into Lago Agrio, Tame alerted me that my flight had been rescheduled for 5pm, which meant I could not catch my connecting flights. I spent half of my stay trying to get hold of someone at the company to see about rescheduling or arranging a refund, but never succeeded. No one ever picked up the phone or returned my messages. I also talked to Priceline, and they could not reach the company either. Instead, I reluctantly cut my visit short, and took an overnight bus back to Quito to catch my remaining flights. At the airport, I spoke to the Tame desk, who told me they could not work with me, and gave me an email address. The email address doesn't work. Priceline filed a refund request on my behalf, which Tame has denied. Tame is not an airline company, it is a racket. Avoid them at all costs.

### "worst airline I have ever seen"
Lago Agrio to Quito. Cancelled my fight without any kind of inform. I Send a dozen of emails, requested the refund of the cancellation. Nothing happened. even there is not a automatically reply. I asked the stuff of TAME at Quito airport twice, first time, they told me they can do nothing about that, advised me to go to their office in Quito. Second time, they ask me leave the email address, of course, still nothing happened. I visited many places of the world, I absolutely sure about that, TAME is the worst airline I have ever seen.

### "they had left my one suitcase"
Ft Lauderdale to Guayaquil. First time flying with TAME. Our flight was delayed an hour. Upon landing in Guayaquil for my two week vacation, TAME informed me they had left my one suitcase with all of my things in it in Ft. Lauderdale due to the other passengers having too much luggage. Other people got to bring 7 and 8 huge suitcases, but my 30 lb tiny suitcase with everything I needed in it to enjoy my vacation was left behind. They said I could spend $100 on things I needed to replace from my bag and they would reimburse me as long as I kept my receipts and uploaded them to the customer complaint form online. I spent $100 on clothes and toiletries to last me until my suitcase would arrive two days later (clothing is expensive in Ecuador). At the end of my two week trip, when I got access to a scanner and wifi to upload my receipts, they told me I was supposed to submit the receipts before my suitcase arrived 48 hours later? Now they will not contact me back and I never got my money back for their mistak even though they said they would reimburse me.

### "No apology, no communication"
TAME cancelled our flight out of the Amazon (we had an international flight to make) and did not tell us - even the call centre kept insisting the flight was scheduled (our accommodation found out it wasn't, strange our accommodation knew more than the call centre team!). Eventually TAME admitted they cancelled the flight and couldn't put us on the next flight automatically - we had to travel for many hours by boat to the airport to try and get one of the last seats on the only flight running that day. No apology, no communication - would never fly with TAME again, wouldn't rely on them whatsoever in the future.

### "worst flight and customer service"
San Cristobal to Quito via Guayaquil. The worst flight and customer service. Dont fly with Tame because the rates for the tickets are not what they say you could be charge more in the counter. We booked a promotional price to Galapagos from Quito, a complete scam. On the way there no one mentioned any extra fees, however when we were checking in to come back from San Cristobal, oh surprise there was an extra charge which was never discussed when we bought the tickets. The response we got from the person in the counter was “well is only 150 dollars more you are American you have the money” what type of reaponse is that. She just laughed at us and said that there was nothing she could do, she even said that when she goes to the US she pays more for a ticket, which is even more annoying since it has nothing to do with our issue. So at the end our options were or to pay or to miss our flight. When I asked for a customer service number she said is sunday no one works anyway. We were forced to pay the extra fee in cash since they dont accept credit cards either, at least we demanded to have a receipt otherwise who gets that money? Never again we will fly with this scamming airline.

### "worst Customer experience"
Quito to Lima. Absolutely worst Customer experience / service I have faced with any airline globally! Not only did they cancel our flights, but then demanded we send 8+ documents to them, justifying why we want a refund, including a signed letter from us?! This is absolutely appalling service, given that the majority of airlines around the world would give you an automatic refund if they cancel your flight. To top if off, I spent over an hour trying to contact customer service about the issue and when I finally go through, their only response was "there is nothing I can do, you need to deal with the refund team" who conveniently don't have a contact number. Shocking - won't ever book with TAME again..

### "they deduct cancellation fee"
Not Verified |  I booked a flight with Tame from Quito to Bogota, it was 07.00 in the morning, a month later my agency told me that flight time has changed, they changed from 07.00 to 21.00. new time was not acceptable for me. Just because it was early flight I chose it and paid more than other airlines. So i asked my agency to cancel the flight and get a refund. 2 Months later they made refund and i got half price of what I paid. The reason was I cancelled the flight and they deduct cancellation fee. Thats a real scam. You cannot change time more than 12 hours and ask me accept it.

### "the worst scam ever"
Guayaguil to San Cristobal. Booking TAME flights is the worst scam ever. When you book flights there is no information about a extra fee for non-Ecuadorian citizens which they charge in the check-in. This is happening everyday but still they act like it's a surprise in the airport. We had to pay 300 us dollars extra per person to get in to the flight.

### "great customer service"
Guayaquil to Baltra. I wish to say a few positive words to review my trip to Galapagos with this nice airline, which proved to be punctual, reliable and with great customer service. I had to anticipate my return flight from Baltra to Guayaquil so I decided to call the customer service on their international line. I was a bit scared as, reding the previous reviews, I was expecting the worse. Actually, the customer assistant on the phone not only spoke perfect English but also managed to help me with the change easily and at no additional cost. In few minutes the new ticket was delivered to my email, together with all the information regarding the entrance requirements to Galapagos. The whole check-in/boarding process was easy and quite fast both ways, and departure and arrival time perfectly punctual. The plane was probably a bit out-of-date but the crew and the pilots did their best to make the flight as pleasant as possible. Drinks and a snack were served during both flights and we got lots of announcements from the cockpit. Smooth takeoff and landing completed the journeys, so overall a nice experience and nothing to complain. I have to say that I travelled much better than with other airline companies.

### "the information was a lie"
Guayaquil to Baltra. We booked three tickets from Guayaquil to Galapagos Islands and checked everything carefully when making the booking. When we arrived at the airport, we were told that we had to pay an extra USD$330 each person as we weren't Ecuadorian citizens. We were then told that in the online booking process, we did not check a box saying that we weren't citizens, which would have adjusted the price. After an hour and a half of complaining, the staff finally agreed to only charge us the price difference of a walk up ticket. This was still USD$130 per person which we reluctantly paid with no other option available to us. When we arrived in the Galapagos, I went through the booking process again as I was 99% certain such a check box didn't exist. Sure enough, the information was a lie and there was no option to disclose nationality that would adjust the price. When I followed up on this complaint, Tame customer service didn't respond until my third email.

### "no online support"
Galapagos Islands to Quito. Worst airline ever. No online support to view reservations or manage booking. There is absolutely no way to choose seats or check-in early. If you arrive at the airport early, they will give you the worst seat. The furthest back row with no recline. If the passenger in front reclines, then you are in the worst possible situation of the entirety of the flight. No room at all. Do not recommend. Don’t take this flight. Go with Avianca or Latam.

### "people are poorly trained, rude"
New York to Quito. Without previous notice, Tame informed us at the airport on January 5th 2018 that our flight was cancelled (even though they still showed the flight as “on schedule” online). I rescheduled to fly on January 9th. That day Tame representatives could not find my flight and accused me of not having “correct information.” They later found my ticket, but the plane already left. Insisting that my booking agent was at fault, they asked me to reschedule my flight for the 15th and pay a $700 price difference. Travelocity then contacted the Tame office and the Tame official on the phone asked me why I didn’t take the flight, as the ticket was always there. They said they “might” be able to have a supervisor change the flight and for me to callback at 10am. I was offended, insulted, and nearly robbed of extra money. I decided to book another airline, and thus the nightmare was over. These people are poorly trained, rude, and have no consumer respect. It took one hour in JFK for a representative to submit a baggage payment. The kicker to this experience was that the manager on duty at the airport in Quito said I should be better informed on “flight terms.” I hope US authorities disallow consumers to do business with this horrible airline. I wouldn’t recommend this airline to my worst enemy.

### "highly recommend against flying with TAME"
Flew New York JFK to Quito. This airline was so bad I felt it a moral obligation to find a site such as this to post a review. Their planes are straight from the 70's. Let's start with checking in. I was travelling with my wife and two small children (4 & 6). After I was told we would be seated together I realized once we got on the plane we were all separated. We were not the only family this was done to. And the irony was we were one of the first online to get seats! Speaking of seats, the seat I was sitting in was so butt-worn, that no matter how I tried to get comfortable, I slid back into the mold that was the culmination of all previous guests rear quarters. Towards the end of the flight, my little one needed to use the bathroom. As we were walking, I see the attendant close the stall since we were beginning our descent. Just as we got to the stall, the attendant said we had to sit down. My son is 4. The guy didn't care. Needless to say, we highly recommend against flying with TAME. I know we never will again.

### "recommend not booking with TAME"
New York JFK to Guayaquil via Quito. Upon arriving at JFK airport to check in we discovered our flight was cancelled. No where does it say it was cancelled until you only check their website. Whatever system they use doesn't interface with Google or Apple's search engines to check if your flight is on time or not. This is really bad to start. We needed to be at GYE to check into our hotel. The airline said you can get the next flight the next day and they would pay to shuttle us to the hotel for a day. We asked for a refund and they said you have to go to customer service. We didn't have time for that so we booked another flight with another airline to get to our destination. On the returning flight we went to TAME in GYE airport and they gave us a print out and specific instructions on how to request a refund and it said exactly how much we would get back which was about 25-30% of what we paid for the entire ticket (not happy about that either, due to taxes). We had originally purchased the tickets through JustFly.com so their reply was to contact them. Justfly and most 3rd party airline bookers's responsibility stops once the flight has taken place. Beyond that there's nothing they can do unless you have bought their insurance plan. So now we're in battle where no one wants to take ownership despite doing what the customer service reps are telling us to do. The reply back we got form TAME was a generic reply in Spanish  mind you. to Contact 3rd party in highlight. Wow, you just can't win. I would highly recommend not booking with TAME. Our flight was cancelled for no reason. I won't fly with TAME again.

### "I will never fly TAME again"
Without notification, my flight from Cuenca to Quito was cancelled. Not only that, but the scenario at the airport was chaos. Although there were partitions available, they were not being used, so, instead of waiting in line, there was a crush of people pushing and arguing at the counter. There should have been an agent on the outside, organizing and prioritizing those with connecting flights, but there was not. It was mob rule. After waiting and waiting to get to the front, I finally talked to someone, and told him I had an international connection to make in Quito. After waiting and waiting again, while others pushed ahead, yelled, and so on, I finally talked to the next agent. I also told this agent I had a connecting flight. We were finally taken by bus from Cuenca to Guayaquil, a 3.5 hour ride through the mountains. I bought a flight because I did not want to take a bus, but ended up in a bus, and the flight they assigned me to did not arrive in Quito on time for my connecting flight. The TAME agents offered absolutely no compensation, saying that they were only responsible for getting me to Quito. At that point they claimed that the flight from Cuenca had been cancelled due to weather, but it was calm and sunny in Cuenca that morning. I told them that I still could have arrived on time had the scene in Cuenca been organized, and people given priority depending on their connections, but this did not matter either. I had to miss my hotel in Lima, spend the night in the airport, and take a 4 am flight out, which I had to pay another $300 for. I will never fly TAME again, and suggest you don't either.

### "have zero customer service"
Baltra Island to Guayaquil They changed my direct flight the night before the flight. It went from a 1hour 50 minute direct flight to a layover with a 4 hour layover, causing me to have to leave my travel companions in Ecuador and miss other forms of transportation we had already arranged. I just cancelled it all together and booked a new flight with Avianca, a good airline. I am still battling with TAME to get my money back but they are impossible to reach and have zero customer service.

### "pathetic customer service"
We made plans to visit Ecuador for May 2016. Unfortunately the earthquake of April 16th destroyed one of our destinations, Manta. It ws too late to make changes and my wife did not feel safe with the possibility of aftershocks and even more earthquakes. Cancelling required much effort. Everyone (Delta, Air B&B, hotels) were happy to refund 100% of our money and they did so quickly. Everyone except TAME of course. After many phone calls, and emails, and me going through a very long process of getting the refund, then agreed to refund us 100%. They said it would take up to 20 working days. It has been over 20 working days and still not refund. I called TAME and I guess that the refund department has no phones and all they could do is email them, which of course I have been doing weekly. I get zero returns to my emails. Pathetic customer service; beware. If I do get my refund I will follow up on this post, to be completely fair.

### TAME customer review
Guayaquil - Galapagos - Quito. Plane cabin was in bad condition dirty and lots of things were broken. Through the cabin you could smell urine coming from the lavatory. No individual inflight entertainment just one drink served despite the fact that on the tickets it clearly says "snack" and "lunch". A very disappointing service for that high ticket price you pay for flying to the Galapagos. There are two other competitor airlines which fly to Galapagos: LAN and Aerogal. Both are much better then TAME I have flown with them. My advice: avoid TAME if you can.

### TAME customer review
6 hours flight from UIO-GRU and back A319 plane a kind of old without onboard entertainment such as personal video system of something like. Food was really good and some generous drinks too. Cabin crew members in both flights were not as much friendly as they should. They should improve personal attention and cordiality. Meanwhile the cost of 430 USD for a flight that usually cost 700 is worth investment.

### TAME customer review
JFK to GYE flight in business class: the plane was pretty old in-seat video/audio quality was poor food was horrible. Plane broke down and there was no flight back from GYE to New York for 5 days. They don't give a refund at the airport and they are quite unfriendly and do not speak English at the ticket counter. There was no announcement / explanations and nobody apologised. I can't recommend this airline for an international flight! I Did a national flight (Quito to Coca) with them which was ok but the airport personnel did not speak any English and again they were not very friendly at all.

### TAME customer review
Cuenca-Guayaquil Guayaquil-Baltra-Quito. Brand new fleet so very clean and comfortable planes (especially E170). Drink and snack provided on 30 minute CUE-GYE flight and placed in business cabin for Guayaquil to Baltra (no difference except seat pitch) nice lunch on board. Return to Quite uneventful.

### TAME customer review
San Cristobal - Guayaquil - Quito. Worst cabin safety I have ever known. No check on whether seat belts were fastened. The girl next to me kept her large hand luggage on her lap throughout the flight. No check on whether seat backs were upright for landing and the meals not all collected on landing. One to avoid in my book.

### TAME customer review
Quito to Guayaquil and back. The price was $280 for two persons: not that cheap considering that you are in a developing country. Plane was a B727 very well kept and with nice legroom and cabin space. The trip is around 35 minutes and you get something to drink and to eat. My only complaint us that some of the FA (especially the ladies) were wearing a face like they lost all relatives friends and the family dog as well in the same day - not very smiling I would say! Apart from this an average normal flight without any delay or problem to be remarked.

### TAME customer review
Living in Ecuador now after 2 years in Costa Rica. That is important because I can use my Distancia Miles collected with TACA on TAME and never before using FF-Miles was so easy and well handled. Flying TAME various times between Guayaquil and Quito. The planes are mostly new and modern E190 and A320 used on this Route occasionly their remaining 727 but those are in very good condition. It is a 30 minute hop and you receive a beverage as well a little cake muffin or similar which I find quiet impressive. Flights had been always on time service on the ground and air leaves nothing to complain. Announcements in onboard in English and Spanish ground staff speaking both as well. Changing flights to earlier or later is professionally and quickly handled without extra costs and a smile. I would recommend TAME travelling in Ecuador.

### TAME customer review
Quito to Porto Viejo. The plane was a new Embraer 170. TAME provides an excellent service on a level you could expect in Europe may be 10 years ago (and completely unknown in the US). There were beverages offered free of charge in the waiting area. The plane was very clean. Seating was a bit tight but perfectly enough for such a flight. The best thing was that there was an board service consisting of a sandwich and free drinks. The plane was on time and the flight attendants were friendly. Well done TAME.

### TAME customer review
Quito-Guayaquil-Baltra return. The aircraft on the way to Galapagos was new (A 320) staff polite and helpful. They served complimentary sandwiches and drinks. On the way back to Quito the plane was an old Boeing 727 (?) but again flight and service were okay. I expected the worst from an Ecuadorian domestic airline but after all I would definitely fly them again.

### TAME customer review
Cali to Quito with a stop in Tulcan and connecting flight to Guayaquil. All flights were on time. The Cali-Quito leg was in a Embraer 170 quite confortable and in a 45 min flight form Cali to Tulcan free drinks full lunch and duty free service was performed by nice flight crew. The Quito - Guayaquil leg was an A320 quite comfortable as well. Once again snack and drinks were served on a 30 min flight. Tame is quite a good option for flying within Ecuador and to Colombia new planes great staff.

### TAME customer review
After reading some of the comments about TAME I was a little apprehensive about our flights from Quito to the Galapagos. Flew on what appeared a fairly new A320 aircraft the flight attendants were cheerful and helpful. Nice salad on the way out with beer/or wine return a hot lunch. Flights on time. Captain said goodbye to passengers on dis- embarking in Galapagos at the exit door which I thought was a nice touch. All in all a very pleasant experience unlike our flight into Quito from Miami with American Airlines which must be the worst airline ever to fly with.

### TAME customer review
Quito-Guayaquil-Baltra (Galapagos) return (Y class available only) in an old Turkish 727-200 (Turkish signs over the emergency exits). I hadn't flown in a 727 since a domestic Aerocontinente flight in Peru in 2002. Pleasantly surprised. The interior was refitted (apart from the Turkish signs) and comfortable. My friend and I asked for emergency exit seats with 2-window legroom and got them. All flights on time planes full with Galapagos cruise groups but service quite good with a coffee/drinks service on the 35-min Quito-Guayaquil leg (they managed to serve every single passenger) and a decent brunch plus free drinks wine or beer on the longer Galapagos leg. FAs pleasant and bilingual.

### TAME customer review
Flew with TAME in September 2005 (Quito to San Cristobal round trip). I'd have to agree with the majority of comments on here - whilst the cabin crew weren't rude they certainly came across as fairly miserable. The food - disgusting. Probably the worst I've ever experienced on a 'plane. Outbound was a Ham & Cheese Roll (I had to remove the 'ham' from the equation as it looked so disgusting) - along with a pack of butter and some jam but nothing upon which to spread them! On the return leg lunch included chunks of turkey that must have died from dehydration before being 'nuked' in an airline kitchen - it was inedible. Amazingly this time there was a dry roll but no butter or spread!

### TAME customer review
Flew Tame to Galapagos in the Month of February 2005. Relatively new air bus A320 planes. Planes were clean and service on board was OK. Nothing special but functional. You expect them to be more friendly since in general I found the people of Ecuador friendly. Food on board was basic nothing special but more than you would normally get on most other carriers.

### TAME customer review
TAME has decent Boeing 727-200s from Lufthansa and a couple of new Airbus A320s as well. Service appears to be much safer (better maintenance and in comparison to flights a few years ago one life jacket per passenger) though food and service can be very basic - no major surprise this airline is operated by the Ecuadorian Air Force (Transportes Aereos Militares Ecuatorians.)

### TAME customer review
Having recently flown TAME I found check in courteous and helpful suitcases are opened for flights to Baltra (Galapagos) in case of food or plants being in them I flew UIO/GYE/GPS and return the A320 aircraft was clean crew very obliging snack and meal up to airline standard (good). aircraft left early on first leg and all other sectors on time. Hand luggage opened in Baltra to check for food/plants etc. Return trip courteous check in and friendly flight crew. I would fly TAME again and look forward to the experience.

### TAME customer review
I agree 100% with Mr D'Adatto Tame´s staff's attitude contrast with the natural friendliness of Ecuadorian people. I have flown twice in the GYE GPS route and many others in the UIO-GYE-UIO and altough the new A320 is quiete a nice airplane the flight attendants on board all my flights are the worst crew I have flown with and believe me I fly a lot. What is the matter with the airline's staff please get someone who enjoy their jobs. Tame's staff have got really a bad attitude towards their customers. I hope and I really do that anyone from TAME would read these comments and take some action about the way they treat their passengers. There is a kind of new airline in Ecuador ICARO which you should try flying at least in the UIO-GYE route.

### TAME customer review
I made two flights onboard a new A320 between GYE to GPS and the new A320 was really nice - seats were very comfortable. The crew members were kind and polite - food was good ( standard airlines food not a "grande cuisine") . The aircraft coming from Quito and Guayaquil was very clean for the return flight (after a short stop over at Baltra airport ) The crew's attitude was very friendly .

### TAME customer review
TAME now operates with two brand new A320. My flight was from GYE to GPS only 1h30 min. The new A320 was really nice but seats were very uncomfortable. The crew members were rude and impolite - the food wasn't good. The return flight was quite the same thing - crew's attitude does not reflect at all the way Ecuadorian people have towards tourists.
