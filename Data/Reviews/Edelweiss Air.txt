### "great seat comfort"
The seats are good. I tried two different airplanes, where the second had a large recline. Which is both plus and minus. The person in front of me took full advantage of this, and I too had to recline, due to no space between me and the screen. Thus bothering person behind me. I like the 2-4-2 layout giving impression of more space. I had at b seat on a 2 seat section. Great movie selection. Food is not as good as experienced on other airlines. On economy only soft drinks, water, coffee is free of charge. You need to pay for additional snacks or alcohol (normally on long haul flights I am used to this being free of charge). Overall great seat comfort, great service but food and beverage is not as good as experienced with other airlines.

### "Everything was excellent"
I flew in January 2025 with Edelweiss from Zurich to Cape Town with my friend. Everything was excellent from the very beginning. The crew was very nice and helpful, answered all my questions accurately and professionally. On the way from Cape Town, we transferred to another flight in Zurich to Budapest. The crew informed us about the ground gate, the time of departure and all the necessary information needed for the transfer. The food was fine. the whole flight went quickly and I was very satisfied. I will definitely choose this company for future flights. The aircraft was clean, tidy and everything met my expectations. The toilets were also in great condition and clean. The crew at the airport was very nice and helpful.

### "Luggage delayed and damaged"
Luggage delayed and damaged. My luggage was first lost, so I filed property irregularity report at the airport. It was found the next day, but I had to travel from Omiš to Split Airport in Kaštela and back, that's almost 90 kilometers. It was returned to me after 21 hours. Im 31 weeks pregnant, all of my maternity clothes was inside, as well as my work files, seeing it was a business trip. I get to the airport and see my luggage is severely damaged to the point one of it's wheels is broken, ripped. It's scratched and bumped. Looked as if someone threw it off the luggage vehicle in high speed. I filed two complaints and they responded to one of them with almost automatic message saying they'll deal with my claim and in case I have further questions to reply to the email. I did so asking what about the other claim. Several days after, still no response. Horrible experience

### "get it from her in the galley myself"
Not Verified |  Edelweiss takes on a pioneering role! In my countless flights with dozens of airlines, such an outrage has never happened to me! On the flight from ZRH-SJO on October 30, 2024, as an eco passenger, I had the nerve to ask the flight attendant for a Diet Coke. She replied briefly and succinctly that I could get it from her in the galley myself! Because of this incident, I complained to the Chef de Cabin on duty, who confirmed that this was correct and gave all sorts of excuses like you couldn't leave the trolley in the cabin and the flight attendants were strict about it. Yes, you could bring the drink to the cheap eco passenger after you get back to the galley with the trolley. And I don't feel sorry for the canteen staff. But during the entire flight I didn't dare to accept any service out of consideration for them. I doubt whether it is in the interest of the cabin crew if 260 Eco passengers on a long-haul show up at the Eco Galley 2 or 3 times to get a drink themselves. Also more than questionable for security reasons. Last but not least, I don't want to keep asking the person sitting next to me to get up because the Edelweiss flight attendant in question is just too lazy. This outrageous incident violates the most basic rules of customer friendliness. Now I will definitely forego direct connections from Zurich and accept changing flights with airlines where you, as an eco passenger, are not treated like a piece of dirt. I'm already disgusted about having to take the return flight with Edelweiss in two weeks. Edelweiss übernimmt Vorreiterrolle! In meinen unzähligen Flügen mit dutzenden von Airlines ist mir so eine Ungeheuerlichkeit noch nie widerfahren! Auf dem Flug von ZRH-SJO am 30.10.2024 habe ich mich als Eco Passagier erdreistet die Flightattendant zu um ein Cola light zu bitten. Diese erwiderte kurz und knapp ich könne das bei ihr im Galley selber holen! Aufgrund dieses Vorfalls habe ich mich bei der diensthabenden Chef de Cabin, beklagt, die mir bestätigte, dass das so korrekt sei und hat allerlei von Ausreden gebracht, wie man könne den Trolley nicht in der Kabine stehen lassen und die Flightattendants hätten es streng. Ja, man könnte nachdem man mit dem Trolley zurück im Galley ist, dem billigen Eco Passagier das Getränk bringen. Und Mitleid habe ich mit dem Kaninenpersonal nicht. Aber ich habe mich während des ganzen Fluges nicht mehr getraut eine Dienstleistung entgegenzunehmen, ais Rücksicht zu ihnen. Ob es im Interesse des Kabinenpersonals ist, wenn auf einer Langstrecke 260 Eco Passagiere 2 bis 3 mal im Eco Galley vorstellig werden um sich selber ein Getränk zu holen, wäge ich zu bezweifeln. Auch aus Sicherheitsgründen mehr als fragwürdig. Last but not least will ich nicht ständig meinen Sitznachbarn zum Aufstehen bitten, weil diese betreffende Edelweiss Flightattendant mal einfach zu faul ist. Mit diesem ungeheuerlichen Vorfall werden die elementaresten Regeln der Kundenfreundlichkeit missachtet. Jetzt werde ich definitiv auf Direktverbindungen ab Zurich verzichten und das Umsteigen in Kauf nehmen bei Airlines, wo man als Eco Passagier nicht wie ein Stück Dreck behandelt wird. Es ekelt mich jetzt schon an in 2 Wochen den Rückflug mit Edelweiss antreten zu müssen.

### "Edelweiss refused to reimburse me"
I flew roundtrip from Liberia to Geneva, via Zurich, for business. My luggage was lost on the trip to Geneva and arrived two days later (after being told it would arrive the night I'd arrived, then the next morning, then the next evening), which meant I had to go to a business dinner wearing shorts and sandals. I purchased pants and a shirt the second day and Swiss, responsible for the Zurich-Geneva flight, reimbursed me. My suitcase was also left in Zurich on the flight back to Costa Rica because I had a mere 45 minutes to make my connection. As Edelweiss is only available in Liberia on Wednesday afternoons (when my flight arrived), my suitcase was transported to Liberia by United and then sat for a full week at the airport. No one responded to my emails, either in Liberia or Switzerland. It was finally delivered more than a week later and cheese I'd bought in Switzerland had spoiled. Edelweiss refused to reimburse me for that cost, saying it was policy not to reimburse people for anything in their home country or to pay for items that could spoil.

### "Worst transatlantic company"
Not Verified |   Worst transatlantic company. In Economy the seats are comparable with a low cost company, but you're travelling long haul -  tiny seats both on width and leg space. Poor selection of entertainment on board and my food was disgusting. I couldnt touch the breakfast. The flight to Puerto Plata from Copenhagen had a layover in Zurich airport. Also on the short haul no complimentary tea or coffee - just water in tiny bottles. I would not recommend this company to even travel for 1 h, worst ever service and rude staff.

### "leg room was completely inadequate"
Not Verified |  The seating and leg room was completely inadequate for a long haul flight. I have flown economy with other airlines and it is never wonderful but this was like a short haul economy flight. I am small and only 5’2” and it was like 11 hours of torture.

### "the best European holiday airline"
I had yet to use Edelweiss but had seen them reviewed positively so we used them on a return home from Tenerife to the United States via Zurich. I'm giving 10/10 on the basis of a European holiday airline; it's not that they're necessarily at five-star standards, but they are without a doubt the best European holiday airline out there. Check in at TFS is handled by the airport staff and not Edelweiss, but it is efficient and the airport is clearly used to handling large numbers of passengers. TFS terminal has more than you would expect prior to your departure. Gate agents were a little haphazard in handling boarding; they didn't seem to realize that Switzerland was part of the Schengen Zone and at first were requiring everyone show their passports only to stop midway through boarding. They also began the boarding process before the gate was open. Not Edelweiss' fault as these were not their employees, but a bit comical. I'm giving them five stars on their ground service for how quickly the bags came off at ZRH, not for that. Once on board, it was quite clear how superior Edelweiss was to their competitors. Their aircraft was clean and comfortable. Not necessarily ultra-modern, but these days, any seasoned traveler can tell you that's a good feeling when the cabin is a bit older and cozier. Your backside will definitely appreciate those padded seats. Edelweiss seats are by far the best in this sector of the industry and on a four-and-a-half hour flight, you'll really appreciate that. I was also pleasantly surprised at how much Edelweiss fed us with included food, snacks, and beverages. On Eurowings Discover or any other similar carrier, you'll be swiping your card for everything. The food was solid--had couscous, which wasn't earth-shattering but definitely acceptable, and their bread was delicious and hot. Drink service is everything you'd expect. The gingerbread cookies at the end are a delightful way to end the flight. Flight attendants were very friendly and personable. I only know a little German (and the Germany variant), so they got a bit of a chuckle for some of the words I used and responded with the Swiss German equivalent. They also spoke English with perfect proficiency to anyone who needed. IFE screens showed the nearest city to where we were, how far away it was, and pictures/information on what there is to see there and whether Edelweiss services that city. Definitely good in-flight advertising. The buy on board shop actually had a few interesting things. Prices aren't cheap, but they never are. Landing in ZRH was right on time and despite some weather, the pilots handled it very well. Got to our gate and deplaning was in an orderly fashion. ZRH is my choice for best connection airport in Europe. Very good shops/places to eat but also impeccably clean, comfortable, and easy to use. We stayed overnight in a hotel nearby and came back the next morning, so we got our bags in ZRH and that was almost effortless. They were out on the belt by the time we made our way down to the claims (and it was a very short walk at that). The nicest execution on an airport Christmas tree I'd ever seen, too. If you're looking for a way to get to a sunshine destination without the nightmare of European holiday carriers, Edelweiss is clearly the way to go and their codeshare services with LX means that you can book one ticket with most Star Alliance carriers. I highly recommend them and will be using them again.

### "never fly this airline again!"
Not Verified |   Edelweiss charged my wife and I $313.00 for two carry on pieces of luggage that were supposedly over 50 lbs each. But they were not. When we received our tickets we understood that we were allowed one free bag each under 50 lbs. We were charged in Las Vegas for the trip to Zurich, but were not charged on the return trip for the exact same bags. When we got home we contacted the airlines about this situation. We were asked to provide evidence that we should not have been charged. We provided the evidence which was on our tickets. We received no further response from the airline despite repeated attempts to contact them. Additionally the flight was very hot and uncomfortable as the air conditioning was apparently not functioning properly. We will never fly this airline again!

### "ignored by customer service"
Our flight was delayed to the next day after departure was aborted due to a flat tire that somehow went unnoticed. Edelweiss then lied when I requested compensation under 261/2004 saying that the flight was not eligible when it is. When I pointed that out, I was promptly ignored by customer service. I had to open a case with a third-party passenger rights company.

### "Worst service ever"
Not Verified |  I would never use this airline again. My flight was almost 10 hours and had to spend all of it in a jumpseat. The person next to me was a very oversized man occupying half my seat so I had to move to the flight attendant seat all the flight. I had complained with the airline since I land and no credit or reimbursement of my ticket. I guess that for them caring for a "fellow passenger" means at the same time to not care at all for the other. Worst service ever.

### "no one has their luggage"
In a group of 34 people from Zurich to Split, no one has their luggage now and we depart from Split in 2 days for the next 11 days of our trip. Swiss Air/Edelweiss has NO email, phone numbers do not get answered, there has been no  communication, and there are 7 flights owned/operated by Swiss Air that depart Zurich for Split before 9:00AM but they somehow can’t get our baggage to us until two nights after they failed to load them… and possibly not even until the day that we’ll already be gone.

### "never flying Edelweiss again"
Flew from Tanzania to Berlin, on the way to Berlin both suitcases got lost took them 4 days to deliver, no compensation. One suitcase damaged writing them now 5 weeks and nothing, it is quite shocking . On the way back to Tanzania one suitcase got lost again, I hope I will get it at least back . Two flights and so much problems for me, never flying Edelweiss again.

### "deplorable and unbelievable"
The worst experience with the baggage. Two times I have flown with them and two times they have lost my baggage. This time they don‘t even know where my baggage is! It’s deplorable and unbelievable!

### "reimbursed me all my costs"
Not Verified | I had previously been critical of my flight to La Palma where the plane was diverted and I tried to get reimbursement for my costs incurred to reach my destination. However after a longish delay the airline reimbursed me all my costs. So full credit to them

### "Worst airline I’ve ever flown"
Not Verified |  Worst airline I’ve ever flown. Flight was delayed by 7.5hrs. They didn’t provide anything but a 20CHF voucher for food (enough to buy a croissant and a coffee) and a 30min WiFi voucher. Staff was incompetent and impolite. After complaining via email 4 times, nobody replied or offered compensation. Choose to fly Edelweiss if you don’t value your time and your dignity.

### "Really uncomfortable aircraft"
Avoid like the plague. Flight operated by Edelweiss, delayed 3 hours on the date, 2 and a half hours on return. No information about it other than "more info will be given at". But no one to explain why or provide help. Really uncomfortable aircraft, not even a low cost is so tight. A transoceanic flight in those conditions is pitiful. Save the onboard entertainment and food. But I will definitely never fly Swiss again. Da evitare come la peste . Volo operato da Edelweiss, in ritardo di 3 ore alla data, di 2 ore e mezzo al ritorno. Nessuna informazione a riguardo se non "maggiori info saranno date alle ore..." Ma nessuno che spiegasse il motivo o fornisse aiuto. Aeromobile davvero scomodo, neanche una low cost è così stretto. Un volo transoceanico in quelle condizioni è pietoso. Si salva l'intrattenimento a bordo e il cibo. Ma sicuramente non volerò mai più Swiss

### "I won't pick them up again!"
The flight was delayed more than 4 hours from the correct time of departure to the time of departure from the apron. First they offered 600 EUR. Then they lowered the value to 300 EUR saying they were wrong and mistake! They say: “Kindly be advised that your case has been reviewed and we will process the payment of EUR 300.- instead of EUR 600.- because the delay at your destination was less than 4 hours.” The flight was over 1,500 km inside the European Union. I won't pick them up again!

### "unpleasant arrogant flight attendants"
Not Verified | Worst airline I ever experienced with unpleasant arrogant flight attendants. Had a flight with my girlfriend, 12 hours from Switzerland to Costa Rica, and we could not sit next to each other. The flight was not even fully booked, and it was her birthday. You can upgrade for 150pp to premium economy to sit next to each other. Will choose any airline over this one.

### "food is absolutely awful and totally sub-standard for business class"
Apart from the lie flat bed this is basically Premium Economy. The food is absolutely awful and totally sub-standard for business class. This is one of the main reasons I say it is more premium economy. The tray is not at all business class, small and cramped. The plates not at all up to standard. My main was a sausage! Can you believe this? The accompaniment of hash browns were soggy because chef in his wisdom had them up against cabbage...which of course is wet. So a main of a sausage, wet hash browns and cabbage. I didn't eat this mess. Disgraceful. My wife's salmon was swimming in oil and inedible. The dessert might have been acceptable but it was tiny...hardly a full spoonful. The drinks selection is basic. A two type wine selection for Red and white....no quality spirits...no dessert wine. No cheese board for after. The IFE is dated with a very small selection. The only thing that was good were the cabin crew. Excellent and I could see they were embarrassed regarding the food. No. This was beyond disappointing. We were totally surprised at their "business" class. We would not fly this airline again.

### "experiences were very pleasant"
This was my second long-haul flight with Edelweiss. Both experiences were very pleasant. I paid $85 extra for the exit row window seat, and this would normally be a wise investment. In fact, the load factor on this flight was so low that whole rows of 4 seats were open and available for sleeping. The two meals were tasty and adequate. The flight attendants were cheerful and efficient. I enjoyed the inflight entertainment which had clear screens and a wide selection for viewing and/or listening. To be honest, if the flight had been crowded, the tight seat pitch would have made the trip considerably less comfortable. I look forward to my next flight with Edelweiss.

### "Customer service is non-existing"
How do you evaluate a medium-haul flight in economy? Overall they are pretty much all the same, until something goes wrong, and that's when you can really have a feeling of the level of the airline. Long queue for check-in in La Palma, could be improved but not too bad. 45 minutes delay at departure due to strong head-wind from coming flight (nice way of saying we wanted to save some fuel), but the captain was confident that with tail-wind we will arrive on time. Too bad he missed his first attempt of landing, and didn't have time to land before airport closure at 11pm. We landed 40 minutes later, 250km away from what was supposed to be our final destination. FA didn't say much and kept saying that we will know more once on ground. That was a LIE!! 0 out of 10 in terms of taking responsibilities. At baggage claim there is no personnel from the airline, just a poor staff from the airport trying to do whatever she can. And the message was clear : you're on your own. It's 1am, you're 250km away from where you were supposed to land, and there won't be any help from the airline to get you to your final destination. Meanwhile, we finally get an email from the airline : "We ask you to make your own arrangements for a hotel and transportation to your final destination. Followed by a couple of restrictions on budget. What a joke!! Customer service is non-existing, this airline is a shame for Star Alliance. It's going to be a while before you see me again on a Swiss flight.

### "Very disappointing lack of service care"
Not Verified |  Were not flown to our booked destination and I incurred out of pocket expenses in order to arrive at my booked destination. Customer after care when I wrote to the airline requesting reimbursement has been non existent. Not even a courtesy of we will review it. Very disappointing lack of service care.

### "A surprisingly great flight"
A surprisingly great flight thanks to the cheerful and friendly crew, free food and beverages and comfortable seats. They're slimline seats but with thick padding and have ample legroom. There's an in-flight entertainment system via wifi which works well. The captain kept us well informed during the flight and we arrived in time at Dubrovnik.

### "most pleasant long haul economy flight"
This was one of the most pleasant long haul economy flights I have ever taken. I was in the window seat of the emergency exit (seat 29A). The seat is somewhat narrow, but it has unlimited leg room. The onboard service was cheerful and efficient. We were served two good meals, and the for-purchase beverages were reasonably priced. I was impressed with how hard the crew worked. I saw attendants regularly cleaning the rest rooms, and they responded instantly if someone rang the call button. The entertainment screens were bright and easy to operate, and there was a fine selection of movies, games, and TV shows. We were delayed an hour and a half out of Zurich, but there were regular updates. The negative aspect of this experience is customer service. They invite passengers to bid on upgrades to premium economy or business class, but the web site will only accept bids if your ticket was booked directly on the Edelweiss website. They have a customer service telephone number that only allows local calls. Any attempt to reach them from abroad for simple assistance in selecting seats in economy is met with an instantly dropped call.

### "FA were extremely courteous"
Zurich to Las Palmas. Edelweiss is still performing a very good service in business class. The meal in business is somewhat reduced as before covid - no more cheese. Ample choice of drinks including Champagne and some Swiss wines. FA were extremely courteous. The flights to Canary islands were never pleasant - longer flights usually in smaller planes (so no wide-body planes ) however Edelweiss is one of the best choices to reach those destinations.

### "understanding and kindness to older people apparently is not part of their policy"
My parents, both 90 years old, with a business class reservation were removed from their seats before departure because my mother apparently was not wearing her mask correctly. She was reminded a few times, she is hard of hearing at 90!, and then they were both removed from the plane. I understand airline policies about mask mandates, but minimal understanding and kindness to older people apparently is not part of Swiss/Edelweiss policy. I myself have had already my share of bad experience with Swiss, after a flight was cancelled (during covid, I have no problem with that) but Swiss rebooked me for the day before my scheduled departure and no email nor telephone notification. In addition, when I bought a new flight and purchased a seat, with printed confirmation from Swiss, at check-in they announced I was not on the flight list and they argued with me for 2 hours at check-in before they finally let me run to the gate. Oh yes, they did acknowledge that they see my seat reservation, but I was not listed as a passenger. I personally will never book with Swiss again.

### "Comfortable and pleasant journey"
Not Verified |  We left Zurich 10 minutes late, which is acceptable but can always be improved. Comfortable and pleasant journey. Even the return, apart from some problems by plane, aieport, many people without arrogant business class passed in front and the flight staff made them pass without problems. Even if my bags were with the priority mark, they arrived last, there may have been a problem with the load. Good company and kindness of the hostesses. Siamo partiti da Zurigo con 10 min di ritardo, il che è accettabile ma si può sempre migliorare. Viaggio comodo e gradevole. Anche il ritorno a parte qualche problema in aereo porto , tante persone senza business class molto arroganti passavano davanti e il personale do volo li ha fatti passare senza problemi. Anche se le mie valige erano con il contrassegno priority sono arrivate per ultime c’è forse stato un problema al carico. Buona compagnia e gentilezza delle hostess.

### Edelweiss Air customer review
A real vacation plane: old seating, crew in quality and training not to be compared with a regular 4 Star Airline. Boarding: pure chaos. Despite Covid-19, the business passengers were boarded first and the economy passengers were then crowded in the aisle. Seat: uncomfortable, old. Little inclination. Food: good, at least on one flight. Plane: despite departure point Zurich, the plane was dirty! On the return flight, the table was still dirty (Covid? Hygiene?). Business class & plane: A320 with economy seats. Seat pitch miserable. Seat comfort miserable. Entertainment: Old movies - only viewable on devices you brought yourself. An A320 for 5.5 hours with economy seating in business class - an insult! Conclusion: cheap product at a high price. Never again Edelweiss!

### "happily fly them again"
Surprisingly pleasant flight, while most airlines have gone no frills, Edelweiss still offers a sandwich and soft drinks, and a cookie and juice prior to landing. Friendly staff, nice flight, would happily fly them again.

### "Business class is total fraud"
Business class is total fraud! Twice the price. Total waste of money! 1) No priority check in in Lanzarote. Despite 3 million tourists a year coming through the airport in Lanzarote, they don't have online check in. But 50m queues, 2 hours before check in like it was some developing country in 1984. When check in opens, they briefly check in business class, then allow economy passengers to move to the business queue, which is then always blocked. No staff checks if you have business ticket or not. So unless you are 2 hours before check-in, there is no priority check in. This time there was an Edelweiss person, but he didn't do much good, compared to the other times where it was just 'I don't give a damn' Swissport personal. Waste of money. 2) There is no priority security. 3) There is no priority boarding. A lady shouted faintly "business' once, waited for 20 seconds, then started boarding all other passengers. Didn't matter since we all ended up in the same overheated bus anyway! So actually, if you go early during this 20 seconds window of priority boarding, you end up waiting longer than economy. 4) The food is just some microwaved slime. 5) The seats are exactly the same as economy class on this flight. Yes there was a seat free in between, but how is that more comfortable if the seat itself is small and short leg room. 6) The carpet was dirty, the seats old and ripped. Never again will I book business class with Edelweiss. A total rip off.

### "Old and uncomfortable seats"
Buenos Aires to Zurich connecting to Amsterdam with Swiss. The Business Class is below average. Old and uncomfortable seats. I am 1,90m tall and my feet didn't find into the foot-space when the seat is turned into bed. They serve the cheapest champagne and the BOSE headphones have been removed.

### "baby bassinet was not allowed"
Ho Chi Minh City to Amsterdam via Zurich. Travelling with 8,5 month baby. Tried to get baby bassinet but was not allowed, only for 8 months old, Apparently 8 months and a few days is not good enough. (weight and length were within requirements). Not willing to support us in seat arrangement and giving us incorrect information so we were not able to arrange ourselves both inbound and outbound.

### " was actually not bad"
Not Verified |  Zurich to Newark. Staff was very friendly and the food was not bad. The drinks were frequent and alcohol included which was great. There were customers who smelled as though they had not showered in days. They were up and moving all flight. Several passengers yelled at them as the airline attendants did not address their lack of concern for other passengers. Had it not been for these people the flight would not have been bad. For a 9 hour flight the airline was actually not bad all things considered.

### "our return flight had been cancelled"
Not Verified |  Zurich to San Diego. Upon printing our boarding passes for a trip to Europe we discovered that our return flight on Edelweiss Air had been cancelled. We called the airline and asked about the cancellation. The customer service person told us that there were no seats to San Diego within 3 days in either direction on the calendar on Edelweiss Air. They found us a flight on Lufthansa out of Frankfurt one day later which required us to fly from Zurich to connect to Frankfurt then on to San Diego. The customer service person assured us that the airline would compensate us for our hotel accommodation for the extra day and told us to contact customer service via email. We did and then our hotel bill was declined because, they said that there was 3 week notice to us before our flight (our trip was 3 weeks, how convenient). I was very disappointed in the mixed message I received from Edelweiss representatives. They knew our flight was cancelled well before our trip's departure and failed to contact us. We feel they dropped the ball and then made us pay for their decision to cancel our flight.

### "was given a meat dish when I had ordered vegetarian"
Not Verified |  Was not happy with this flight, leaving from Birmingham to Vancouver we booked a vegetarian meal, but was given a meat dish and when asked for a vegetarian they said we needed to book it, which I did on my online check in. The same happened on my return, I was given a meat dish when I had ordered vegetarian. Check-in at Vancouver nearly took 50 min with 15 people in front, they had no ground staff. I will not be flying with Edelweiss Air again, very disappointed with this.

### "Overall a great service"
Zurich to Tenerife. Very pleasant experience with Edelweiss. Check in at Zurich is done by Swiss. It was efficient and staff was helpful. Boarding started 10minutes later than planned but once boarding was completed we were ready to go on time. I was travelling with two young children and the cabin crew were very attentive with us throughout the flight. They offered a kids pack with crayons and a a booklet with activities. The children breakfast was offered first and then to the rest of the passengers. Breakfast was very nice, with two types of cheese, and two types of ham, yogurt, fresh warm bread loafs were offered twice with a choice of white and brown bread. It felt like a business class service. During the 4 hour flight drinks were offered a number of times. The seating comfort was good (we were sitting in row 7). Seats had a decent recline whilst also leaving sufficient knee space. The seatbacks had a special small tray were passengers can install and attach their tablets. Flight crew communicated before departure to advise of a slight delay due to traffic at the airport and throughout the flight offering details of the routing and arrival times. Arrival at Tenerife was on time and the baggage was delivered with less than 10 minutes wait. Overall a great service and good value for money.

### "I would highly recommend"
San Diego to Zurich. Excellent from start to finish. Punctual, professional and passionate. Everything from seat comfort, and service, to in-flight entertainment and meals was well above expectations. I left very impressed to say the least. I would highly recommend this airline.

### "service was so good"
Zurich to Calgary. Was awesome service. The staff was awesome, service was so good as well as Foods and drinks. Clean “Washroom and a smiling face

### "all was excellent"
I booked a flight form Cape Town to Zurich using Edelweiss Air being aware the airline is the Swiss holiday operator, so I was expecting a mediocre service as you can expect for the price paid and class of market served. Totally to the contrary all was excellent, the plane not only very clean but looking new, the crew friendly and efficient, the entertainment system good with new movies and the food very good with real cutlery and a glass wine glass that enhances taste. The only minus point was the price charged for the alcoholic beverages, but on the other hand, the airline has to make money somewhere and it avoids passengers imbibing in excess. On my future travels I will definitely consider this airline again.

### "the selection of films was good"
Zurich to Ho Chi Minh. We paid 149 CHF to Upgrade to economy max each way. Thoroughly worth it, had 4 seats each on the way out, and 2 seats each on the return. Even without this bonus it would've been worth the money as the extra legroom and recline was nice. I found the food to be acceptable both ways, especially the fresh bread. I disagree with a previous contributor as I thought the selection of films was good, much better than recent trips on Virgin Atlantic and Thai - recommended.

### "worst experience ever"
Not Verified |  Zürich to Seville. My worst experience ever. The flight was scheduled to depart Zurich at 16.30h, and I was happy to see there was no departure delay. So we left in time, but after about an hour in the air, the plane returned to Zurich due to technical problems. After landing in Zurich again, we were waiting for some 3 hours in the airplane. they were looking for some spare parts to repair the airplan, until they finally figured out that there was a spare part, but they did not get clearance to build it in. So we were shipped back to the gate. no information there, just a never ending queue of people. We left and went home, just to get a message finally that we were scheduled for another flight - 48 hours later. Instead of leaving Friday for the weekend, they scheduled us to leave Sunday evening.

### "I would avoid Edelweiss"
Ho Chi Minh City to Zurich. We booked this flight with Swiss but we actually flew with Edelweiss. Unfortunately, this airline is not a good one for long haul flights. The legroom was horribly inadequate and the whole flight was uncomfortable. We asked to be in seats with more legroom and offered to pay for this, but they said these sits are reserved for families with kids. In the airplane I saw plenty of people half my size sitting at those sits with extra room, so clearly they did not tell us the truth. Also, the food served was very poor, especially the breakfast. They also wanted to charge 8 swiss francs for a serving of wine. The ticket price was normal, so I would expect to at least get some drinks included. For anyone who flew with an Asian airline for a long distance trip, Edelweiss is simply bad. I would avoid Edelweiss for any long haul flights and would only use for short distance flights.

### "airline was absolutely excellent"
I had originally booked this flight from Zurich to Ho Chi Minh City with Swiss Air. Then I found out it was operated with Edelweiss Air. I’m so glad they did. The airline was absolutely excellent. The service on there was first class even in economy you were treated and cared for like you were the only passengers on the flight. I can’t praise the cabin crew enough for how friendly they were, how generally interested in us and couldn’t do enough for us. Food without a doubt the best I’ve ever had on an airline. A cheese and meat platter for breakfast was a total wow factor. All meals very tasty. Legroom perfect. Only downside the movies weren’t great. But by no means does that dampen my incredible experience on this airline.

### "Service was superb!"
Zurich to Ho Chi Minh City. Seated row 6 which has a lot of legroom. Plane interior was refurbished: new seats, touch screen, OkK/ good selection of movies. Service was superb! Food quality is good.

### "Outstanding customer service"
Zürich to Buenos Aires. A nice surprise. Very clean aircraft, great food (I had vegetarian), the bread is probably the best I had in a commercial flight, limited entertainment system but does the Job. Outstanding customer service in all points. Negative issues: seats are hard as rock, leg space is minimal. Once seats are reclined the distance between my nose and the TV were 12 cm. I am sure in business it was not that bad.

### "the food not so great"
Not Verified |  We had a return flight to Ho Chi Minh from Birmingham via Zurich with Edelweiss, never used them before so did not know what to expect. Could not choose your seat unless you had paid in advance or until 24 hours when you could check in online. Easy flight from Birmingham to Zurich with a very short changeover that we were concerned but there was no need at all. You were asked if you had the correct visa for Vietnam before boarding and checked. The plane itself was clean, reasonably spacious (as can be for economy! )and the crew very friendly and helpful. We found the food to be not so good though but the fresh bread that went round was a much better idea. Much the same on the return trip but the one thing we had a problem with was we could not check in on line, I did email Edelweiss and to their due they did mail me back within a couple of hours and report a fault. Again most ok but the food not so great but did enjoy their continental style breakfast!

### "not allowed access to Lounge"
Not Verified |  Larnaca to Zurich. Flight was satisfactory but my biggest gripe is that I was not allowed access to the Business Lounge at Larnaca Airport, surely this should be automatic when paying for Business.

### "shame for a Swiss carrier"
Zurich to Mykonos. Total shame for a Swiss carrier. Less space than on easyjet and Ryanair but incredibly expensive for nothing. Food was ok, and the crew was not authentic.

### "a pleasant surprise"
Dubrovnik to Zurich. Flying business with Edelweiss was a pleasant surprise, this low cost branch of Swiss offered excellent service, great food and excellent comfort. The only downside was that there was no access to Airport lounge at departure, which was very dissatisfying as it is one of the main reasons I chose to fly business.

### "seating most uncomfortable"
Birmingham to San Jose via Zurich using Helvetic Airways and Edelweiss. We used four flights on this particular trip with Swiss or its share code partners, none of which were on time, an average of 1 hour late. We had never flown via Edelweiss previously and probably will never do so again as the experience was not good. Our first bad experience was an email request to Swiss for assistance about our booking, we never had a reply to our request even 14 days after it was put in the only reason we ever did get an answer was because I obtained the email directly to Swiss CEO. On board the aircraft the service you will receive at best can be described as average in economy class, probably a little better in economy plus or business. No free alcoholic beverages in economy class you will be charged for a beer or glass of wine with the meal you will receive and the average cost is around $10 per drink. Comfort on Board and hidden extra expense in Economy Class. The seating setup is probably the most uncomfortable we have experienced on a long haul carrier, the seats are very tight and small little of no room to move and we are only small bodied people 1.64 and around 70kgs. Although the aircraft are new and clean the comfort level in economy class is extremely bad and we would not recommend it. If your baggage is overweight (above 23kgs) you will be charged an excess baggage fee of approximately $200 per suitcase.

### "a terrible airline"
Received an email at 3pm on day of travel to let us know that the Zurich-Cape Town leg of our flight had been moved from 10pm that evening to 8am the following morning. Annoying but compounded by fact that the Amsterdam to Zurich leg of our flight had also been cancelled and it was therefore impossible to get to Zurich in time to catch the delayed flight to Cape Town. Edelweiss offered no explanation, apology or assistance so had to rebook flights for my family and I, cancel and rebook hire car at extra cost and rebook accommodation as would now be arriving after midnight (meaning that we lost a day of our holiday as well). On our return I wrote to Edelweiss to request compensation only to be told that as they are a Swiss airline they do not need to do so and therefore would not - their reply as follows: "Edelweiss adheres to the legal texts of the prescribed ordinances and we therefore stick to our previous statement. The legal text of Regulation (EC) 261/2004 does not provide for compensation in the case of delayed flights. For final clarification, we refer to the judgment of the district court Bülach, 02.02.2016, which has become legally valid and published: No compensation payments are due for late flights to and from Switzerland. All-in-all a terrible experience with a terrible airline - customer service = zero. Avoid

### "They give our seat away"
Zurich to Cape Town. Me and my wife go on Edelweiss Air website to buy  ticket as review was so good. When we book we see we can book our seats and it was still empty and was happy to get all the good seats for flight out and return. The day when we check in we can't and call the airline and they say we only have pay for our Economy Max seats and not for the ticket. How can it not included the flight? We need to fly and then we say ok we will pay for the flight and they say sorry its full. They give our seat away. That is so bad that we need to pay for another flight. So bad customer services and super bad website.

### "break two checked in bags"
❌ Not Verified |  Edinburgh to Zurich.This airline managed to break two of my hard shell Samsonite bags! I have the best luggage Rimowa and Samsonite and this airline managed to break two checked in bags on two different flights! They have not been helpful in repairing the bags. They say I have to repair them and send them the bill but offer no place to do the repairs. They are not responding to emails and are extremely rude to deal with. My husband and I have not been able to get any response or help in repairing or replacing these bags and despite the fact that they are the only airline with direct flights from Zurich to Edinburgh we would never fly them again and would stick to British aAirways.

### "overall a good carrier"
My wife and I travelled from Cape Town to Barcelona via Zurich in November 2017 with our 8 month old baby on Edelweiss / Swiss Air. My review is in connection with the long-haul flights between Cape Town and Zurich. Edelweiss is overall a good carrier. The aircraft was new, clean and engendered trust in the airline, however there are two points which the airline has to improve upon: Accommodating babies. On the Cape Town to Zurich leg, there was insufficient time to book a seat at the bulkhead with a Bassinet, however the Cape Town ground crew assisted us and upgraded us to 'Economy Max' which provided us with bulkhead seating and a bassinet for our baby to sleep in, which was appreciated and not expected. However upon our return trip, which ironically was when we had the foresight to try to book a bulkhead seat in normal economy, we found that in trying to book a bulkhead seat and a bassinet (both on the website and via email correspondence) ,the airline did not accommodate us. We even paid 58CHF to secure 2 seats, however there were no bulkhead seats available and NO provision for parents with babies who actually need those bulkhead seats due to the bassinet facilities. Upon arrival at both Barcelona and Zurich Airports - on return to Cape Town - the ground crew would not or could not help us. We therefore had to travel 12 hours with a baby on our lap between Zurich and Cape Town and noted that the bulkhead seats were not occupied by people with babies. A most uncomfortable arrangement, with airline crew not assisting in making it any more easy for us or offering more suitable seating with a bassinet. It is totally unacceptable that no provision is made for booking with infants on the website or via email. We did send an email about 3 days prior to our trip, but this was only answered upon retuning to Cape Town. Not acceptable. The boarding system is chaotic. Not only in Cape Town, but Barcelona and Zurich. Everyone rushes at the same time to board the aircraft upon announcement of boarding. Why does the airline not look at what Singapore Airlines or other airlines do in boarding in a systematic and orderly fashion - thereby reducing an anxious and chaotic boarding process. They are a Swiss Airline after all - one would expect it! Ironically, upon getting into the aircraft, the aircrew constantly harass passengers with an announcement basically saying that passengers much step aside and get in their seats as soon as possible to allow other passengers to board. Surely if they instituted an orderly boarding system, this would actually be far more efficient, and this announcement would be unnecessary?

### "had a problem with our baggage"
Zurich to Mauritius. We had a problem with our baggage. They arrived three days late. we had to waste some hours of our holidays to shop the minimum we need. Now, it is more than one month that I'm claiming for the money we had to spend. They always have problems when receiving the mail or the attachment documents. I have travel a lot in my life. It is the first time that my luggage have been lost but you can be sure that I'm not going to travel with them again even if I have to pay more for a ticket.

### "stewardess lack of empathy"
Paris CDG to San Jose via Zurich. Terrible experience, Its been 3 days and they have not responded to my emails about my missing luggage, the people at the airport said they never loaded the luggage on the plane in Paris and that I have to file a report with the airline, but the airline is not responding to any emails. I was surprised about how terrible the service was, even though I reserved seats for the first row because my wife and I traveled with our 19 month old on lap and I asked for a cradle, they assigned me on two middle seats with no aisles. When I asked the stewardess if she would help us she just said the flight was full and looked upset about the baby, I understand other passengers looking upset about a baby on a long flight, they are not supposed to provide any service to you but the stewardess lack of empathy with our situation was bothersome. When I asked if they had baby food like the one they gave us on the flight towards Paris she said that I had to have ordered it prior to the flight.

### "It was a perfect flight"
I got upgraded to Economy Max on this 11.5 hour flight from Zurich to San Jose, Costa Rica. It was a perfect flight. Highly motivated staff, good legroom, excellent seat with a very big IFE screen. Good selection of movies. The food was very good. I loved the extra warm and crunchy fresh bread they handed out. They only had one type of beer and two types of red wine but they were all good. Beer could have been colder, though. Nice touch with the Mövenpick ice cream mid flight. Toilets very clean and I appreciated the the free mouth wash offered. The vase with red roses was a nice touch too. It was really how economy travel should be, but now a days you have to pay extra for what used to be the norm. I am glad the option exists tough, as the jump to business class is too big in most cases. Well done Edelweiss!

### Edelweiss Air customer review
Cape Town to Zurich. My experience did not start very well, because I could not do the online check-in. So, I when to the airport CPT very early for check-in. Ground service was very disorganized. When ground staff arrived there was some people queueing, but the staff ignored those people and organized the queue has people was not there... confusing between passengers occurred just because the staff did not made a small effort. When I got to the check-in desk, the staff did not make any effort to get me a better seat as asked. After spending a couple of hours waiting, we board on time. When I was getting in the plane, my seat was changed, and it was changed for a window seat, that I do not like. I look to my original seat, and there was not even children involved in the changing. No reason was gave to me. If they mess up with something, they should had changed me to a better seat, not a worst seat. Confort was not good, legs space was small. Food was just ok, and entertainment was very good.

### "courteous crew and service"
Stockholm to Zurich with a courteous crew and in-flight service. Hot snack and drinks were served in this two-hour flight. The flight was rather empty so I had the entire row to my self. Movie was shown on main screen so there was some entertainment if caught unguarded. Inflight magazine was also nice.

### "great travel experience"
Zurich to Marsa Alam. Great travel experience on this Edelweiss flight to Egypt. Flight was not fully booked so we had a full row for ourselves. We were served a typical Swiss breakfast with bread, butter, jam, yoghurt and a fruit salad. Bread was served warm, directly from the oven and you could take as much as you like. Cabin crew was very friendly and helpful. Only thing to complain is the inflight entertainment system, which for a 4 hour flight is a bit basic. But I heard that by now even this has been updated.

### "staff were also great"
Edelweiss Air were great flying from Edinburgh to Zurich. Firstly, the price was considerably cheaper than flying with a low-cost carrier to an airport further away from my final destination (I was visiting a friend in Konstanz - these flights were cheaper than EasyJet to either Basel or Stuttgart). I was given a free meal, albeit cold (with freshly baked hot bread), for a 2h flight. The staff were also great with me when I asked them how to get to the Airport train station (in a different building to where you land) to continue my journey to Konstanz. The return was equally satisfying.

### "Trouble free journey"
Vancouver to Zurich. I was a little sceptical about travelling on a Leisure airline long-haul even in Business class (part of a round-world fare). Edelweiss Air proved me wrong. Great cabin crew, a great aircraft with full flat beds. Great food. Trouble free journey.

### "ridicously tight seating"
Las Vegas to Zurich with Edelweiss Air. Ridicously tight seating in Economy class made this one of my least relaxing long-haul flights ever. Being a relatively standard size (190 cm) I was surprised to find that I simply couldn't sit normally without my knees touching (or rather pressing hard into) the seat in front of me. When the passenger in the row in front of me reclined his seat, I felt like a sardine - with badly hurting knees. Sleeping was completely impossible, and hadn't it been for the nice and friendly crew and the above average IFE that helped kill the 10 hours I was wide awake, it would have been my worst flight ever. Avoid this airline in Economy class at all costs if you're taller than 165-170 cm.

### "service was very poor"
Phuket to Zurich with Edelweiss Air. The service during the flight was very poor and the attitude of the cabin crew with passengers was really rude. In addition, after paying more than 600EUR for a flight ticket, they ask you to pay extra money if you want an alcoholic drink, otherwise you just can drink coke, ale or orange juice.

### "cannot rely on Edelweiss"
No recommendation for Edelweiss. They cancelled our flight from Zurich to Marsa Alam (planned for 25th February 2016) without notifying us to the earliest possible moment. It is only 4 weeks before our holidays and we had to call the hotline, to find out, that they wont fly! This is the second time this is happening. In 2013 we had the same issue with Edelweiss - flight cancelled 15 days before departure, which is unacceptable for a "holiday flight". The only option they offered to us now was to fly from Zurich via Geneva to Cairo, which is 700km away from our target destination, Marsa Alam. Service and comfort is okay, but that does not weigh up the cancelled flights. You simply cannot rely on Edelweiss Air.

### "recommend this airline"
Edelweiss Air is one of the best. We flew Zürich to Cape Town on a cabin that had just been refurbished, premium economy has great leg room, food service is amazing and the PTV offers a large choice of programes. Staff very friendly and proactive. I would recommend this airline.

### "satisfied with high standards"
Dusseldorf to Larnaca via Zurich, and it was the first time I flew with Edelweiss Air. I was satisfied with the high standards and service provided. The flight lasted 3 hours and the crew served the passengers the snack, meal, dessert. Metal cutlery was provided to all passengers instead of plastic.

### "terrible customer service"
A couple of days before leaving for Florida, got an email from Edelweiss offering an upgrade to Business for cash. Less than an hour later I called and booked the upgrade for my wife and I. A short while later got another email from them, telling me there were no upgrades available! Terrible customer service.

### "ridiculously tight seating"
A supremely competent cabin crew can't make up for ridiculously tight seating. We paid quite a bit extra to fly Edelweiss Air from Las Vegas to Zurich on a friend's recommendation, and were shocked at how little space we had. If the person in front of you reclines, you are forced to recline just to see the screen in front of you. I can't stress how uncomfortable the seating was. Worse, they place ads on their video system trying to sell "Economy Max" seating for 200 Swiss francs a seat. They tout these are "anti-thromboses" seats. So the seat I paid $1500 for is a "pro-thromboses" seat? Great crews, incredibly uncomfortable seating. Never again.

### "Most uncomfortable flights"
Most uncomfortable flights with Edelweiss Air between Tampa and Zurich in economy class. The distance between seats (the pitch) appears to have been reduced a bit. What makes it worse however is that the seat back recline is disproportionately huge. When the passenger seating in front of you fully reclines his seat, that seat back comes to about three inches from your nose. And you are supposed to enjoy in this position the otherwise very good choice of movies and other entertainment available on your individual screen. If you have any food or drink on your tablet when that passenger decides to slam his seat back to full recline, it will be squished, possibly spilling wine etc on your lap. Your only recourse is to hold that drink in your hand and, in turn, recline your own seat back encroaching on the passenger behind you. And if you can’t eat in that reclined position, too bad. The crew don’t make the usual announcement that all the other airlines make when they serve food, asking people to kindly bring their seat back in the upright position to accommodate their fellow travellers.Most important thing for me is seat comfort, particularly leg room. Would not use them again when traveling to Zurich or beyond.

### "excellent Edelweiss Air flight"
We had an excellent Edelweiss Air flight from Zurich to Larnaca. Captain gave information about the flight in a very friendly manner. The crew was helpful and smiley. Food was not so tasty but it is quite normal for airline food. I had flew Edelweiss Air from Larnaca to Zurich as well and the flight was also great. P.S I am one of those who are scared of planes, although I have to fly quite a lot, but Edelweiss Air has gained my confidence.

### Edelweiss Air customer review
We flew to Havana from Barcelona via Zurich and back (2 adults, 2 kids). BCN-Zurich-BCN leg with Swiss was good. Zurich-HAV-Zurich with Edelweiss was a very nice experience. Cabin crew very professional and attentive. In the return flight we were upgraded to Economy Premium. IFE had little films in Spanish - apart from that flying Edelweiss is recommended.

### Edelweiss Air customer review
YVR-ZRH return. on the way there sat in Premium Economy. I'm 6'2", 250 lbs and had more than enough leg room,. width could have been a bit more but all in all a good experience. Cabin crew was courteous, food was good. Return leg sat in Economy (row 15A), I recommend not sitting that row as it's the first row of economy and has premium economy seats reclining into you. Best to book row 16 or back. TV technology best I've seen, but movies/tv shows a bit out of date. Games are easy to play and don't bother person in front of you. Zurich airport is decent size but not as busy as Frankfurt or London. I recommend Edeleweiss.

### Edelweiss Air customer review
Very good flight, comfortable seat with enough space, good service and meals.

### Edelweiss Air customer review
Reservations is difficult to reach if calling from USA primarily because of their operating hours and time difference. I called multiple times and waited at one point for 40min for an agent. Finally an agent answered the line only to advise me the office was now closed and to please call tomorrow. The reason for my repeated call was seat assignments. I don't mind and expected to pay for advanced seat selection how ever neither the website nor the call center was helpful. The website finally received the required update and we confirm our seat selection. The flight crew was friendly, competent and helpful. Food was typical. Seat room and pitch terrible. When we arrived our bags didn't. Absolutely terrible customer service. We are unable to reach anyone and have yet to hear from Edelweiss. I am not impressed with some of Edelweiss customer service.

### Edelweiss Air customer review
Flew from Tampa to Zurich. Found the flight attendants to be very professional and attentive. Many good entertainment options, which made the 10 hour flight go by quickly. Plain interior was very clean and looked updated. The cabin temp was oddly warm for the Tampa-Zurich flight until about the last hour, which made sleeping a bit difficult. Flight back, though, was much more comfortable. To get a seat assignment, we had to pay $40 each way per person, which I thought was a bit steep, but glad we did so we were guarranteed to sit together as the flights were rather full. Would definitely use them again when traveling to Zurich or beyond.

### Edelweiss Air customer review
I flew in Economy Class from Zurich to Malé on 16th of May and back on 24th of May 2015. I have to say I am very impressed by the service provided. Cabin staff were very dedicated (it was the same staff on both flights as they were also staying in the Maldives for a week). The night flight on the outward leg was only half full which made a quick Service possible and I could sleep in an empty middle row. Very good meals (real cutlery and a real glass) frequent drinks and the alcoholic beverages (for which you have to pay) are of good quality and moderate in price. I also liked the Mövenpick icecream provided in mid-flight on the return flight (a day flight). The inflight entertainment is a very good product with an up-to-date movie selection. But the major bonus has been the consistent friendliness of the entire crew. I felt a strong sense for hospitality among the staff and would definitely fly with them again if the schedule suits me.

### Edelweiss Air customer review
Funchal-Zurich 14 Feb 2015 business class. Warm welcome from the captain at the aircraft door cabin crew very friendly and attentive during all the flight. Welcome drinks served on the ground. Menu presented to each passenger with excellent quality of all items two cold starters 3 options of main course tray with cheese desserts and chocolates. Everything was done with time and attention drinks and hot bread offered several times and even a pre arrival snack was given. Onboard music entertainment system but not individual screens for the movie. Overall the best business class product I know on European flights.

### Edelweiss Air customer review
ZRH - TPA on Oct 24: Overall Edelweiss Air have a very good and contemporary business class product. In many ways it felt like a more modern and upgraded version of Swiss. There was only one aspect about the flight that I didn't like and that was cabin temperature. It was far too warm for comfort. When I waited for the (single) lavatory to become available the control screen showed that the temperature was set at 25 degrees. High cabin temperatures also tend to be a frequent problem on Swiss flights.

### Edelweiss Air customer review
Surprised to see a "charter" airline flying a brand new A330-33. Flight ZRH-LAS with excellent service. Economy comfort is worth the extra payment. Very friendly staff.

### Edelweiss Air customer review
I have flown on Edelweiss many times in the past years short as well as long haul. The latest flight was Zurich - Mykonos in June this year. It was a pleasant experience. The crew is multilingual and kind the food is delicious. Breakfast offered warm rolls and brioches yoghourt fruit orange juice coffee. And at the end of the flight you get their famous Biberli. Will continue flying with them in the future.

### Edelweiss Air customer review
ZRH-LAS-ZRH for business reasons as it was a direct flight. Never again in economy. The plane had a delay for 10 hours due to technical reasons. That could happen. I prefer to fly safely but after these 10 hours waiting no extra drink onboard. All we got was a piece of paper explaining the problem. I'm 188 cm tall and I can't recommend economy class for people who need some legroom and have to sit there for 12 hours. The crew was very friendly but could not change anything as the flight was fully booked. Next time I will fly via SFO.

### Edelweiss Air customer review
ZRH-LCA-ZRH was our first experience with Edelweiss but were very positively surprised! Comfortable seats good legroom excellent service (small gifts for kids decent warm meal) and reliable timing no complaints whatsoever!

### Edelweiss Air customer review
ZRH-CAG-ZRH in Ycl for holidays. Great flights operated by LX aircraft. Very attentive crew and helping families on board. Breakfast on the outbound flight and sandwich service on the inbound flight with several round of drinks. The service given by Edelweiss is above average in terms of charter flight to summer holiday destinations. I will definitely use their service again.

### Edelweiss Air customer review
Booked a flight on the Edelweiss flight direct from Tampa to Zurich with Swiss. As a Gold Premier member I provided my Star Alliance number during the booking and was advised that I would receive miles for the flight as it was being booked with Swiss Airlines. Once I received the confirmation I noted that my Gold Premier number was not on the booking and called Swiss Airlines to find out why. I was advised it was somehow not on the reservation and they indicated it would be added. When we attempted to check-in online the website was down so we had to wait until hours before the trip. Once it was up I saw that my Gold Premier number was still not listed despite 2 prior attempts. In any case we were assigned poor seats didn't get priority boarding or any of the other perks that are supposed to come with Gold Premier status. When I contacted Swiss after the flight I was advised all the information we relied on in choosing Swiss was incorrect per below. So even though we paid Swiss which issued the tickets and the plane was referred to as a Swiss there are no Star Alliance benefits. As to the Swiss affiliate Edelweiss the plane was hot cramped uncomfortable and all drinks were a charge for this 10-hour flight. This was on the way to and from. To add insult to injury the staff were cold and short even for people from Central Europe and Edelweiss will allow the Economy Plus (Extra) to go empty rather than upgrade anyone with Star Alliance status. Instead they want $200 per person per way. The Economy Plus on our return flight was empty yet they ran out of food (unless you want curry on a 10-hour flight) and we were only 3 rows back from the front of Economy. In short we will never fly Swiss or Edelweiss again. Better bet out of Tampa is to drive to Orlando and take the direct on Lufthansa to Frankfurt.

### Edelweiss Air customer review
CPH-ZRH-PMI-ZRH in C class. Very impressed with Edelweiss in general. Nice clean aircraft and lovely and attentive crews. From PMI we were Lucky than Edelweiss changed the aircraft to their brand new A330-300 long haul aircraft I guess to familiarise crew with the new aircraft. Food was nice and well presented on all trips and all flights on time.

### Edelweiss Air customer review
We flew in march from Zurich to Cape Town. The flight quality overall was very low. The entertainment system was very old (prehistoric) small screen very few movies. Food was poor and we had to pay for alcoholic drinks given the ticket price you would expect this to be at least included.

### Edelweiss Air customer review
ZRH-FNC C class. Outstanding service! Pre-departure drinks (champagne juice water) amenity kit as usual on long-haul flights headphones hot towels full breakfast with good selection of cold hot plate and bread/croissants and lots of drinks available. Hot snack service 1h00 before arrival. Crew very friendly attentive and professional. On time flight. One of the best flights I ever did!

### Edelweiss Air customer review
Not sure if it is a charter or schedule airline. Travelled Geneva-Heraklion return. Excellent both ways friendly staff a nice lunch on way out questionable on return. As a matter of personal conscious I do not eat Veal however a bite of the sausage on return leg made me question it's ingredients to find it was veal. They should have informed pax prior to service so we had a choice to refuse. Other than that pretty faultless flights.

### Edelweiss Air customer review
Flight from ZRH to YVR and back. A 10 Hour non-stop flight: I had the best service. Very kind crew who served something to drink every 30 min. The meal was very delicious.

GVA-TFS TFS-ZRH. Flight out was in fact on LX metal and was fine except they lost our bags and we spent 4 days in Tenerife without. Good seat pitch in Y pleasant crew good food. Return on WK metal - friendly crew who gave us free wine after being told by TFS staff of our problems. Emergency exit row gave us good leg room. Good hot meal plenty of drink runs. Toilets clean. Film shown we had our own earphones. On time arrival at ZRH. Onward flight to LON however cancelled due to snow.

### Edelweiss Air customer review
Recent trip from Zurich to Tampa. Check-in personnel fast and friendly the stewardesses were delightful with smiles. The airplane was new I had my own personal entertainment system. Great food and plenty of it. The plane took off on time. Plenty of seat space in economy. I paid less than I would have paid for the same trip with the airlines I usually booked with!

Round trip to canary islands on this Swiss airline. Clean aircraft friendly and efficient FAs good info from the flight deck - deserves a 4 star ranking!

### Edelweiss Air customer review
Frankfurt-Zurich. Crew was friendly flight arrived late in Zurich but due to the effort of the ground staff I could reach my connection flight to JNB. I was picked up with a car at the plane and brought to the Gate of the Swiss connection flight. Also my luggage made the transfer in the 31 minutes from arrival to departure.

### Edelweiss Air customer review
I was booked to fly Heathrow to Heraklion via Geneva in October 2010. I chose Edelweiss mainly because I had to be at the airport at 1130 and I hate an early start! Unfortunately the flight leaving Heathrow was late. I was worried about missing my connecting flight at Geneva but the staff at Heathrow assured me that all connections would be made. When it became plain that I was in danger of missing my connection I asked the air steward to ask the pilot to ask Geneva to hold my connecting flight (I missed it by 10 minutes) but was told 'We can't do that'. When I got to Geneva I was told that I was being sent to Zurich in 2 hours time booked into an hotel for the night and off to Heraklion at 0620 the next day. They did not give me vouchers for food at the airport despite the fact that I'd been in their care since 1130 and only received a light snack. I was given 20SF to spend on a meal at the hotel (which was a Hilton) I had to pay another 57SF. The first hotel bus would have got me to the airport around 0545 for 0620 flight so a taxi cost another 20SF. There was no breakfast available until the flight took off - and I chose them because I don't like an early start!

London City to Heraklion returning a week later. Zzurich to Heraklion was with Edelweiss. Friendly welcome including English language newspaper and efficient service with good food (choice of main course). Perhaps the drinks trolley could have preceded the food service but otherwise impeccable.

YYC-ATH with change in Zurich. One of the best charter flights I have been on nice cabin interior good meals friendly staff and on time. Inflight entertainment very limited not a problem for me.

### Edelweiss Air customer review
Excellent economy class (PUJ-ZRH) - food service & seats are excellent. Service and comfort better than Swiss aircraft. Business class (ZRH-PUJ) not bad but only in first row! If you fly on Edelweiss Air (A330-200) no sense to pay extra money for business.

### Edelweiss Air customer review
Since Swissair collapsed have had to fly from Larnaca (Cyprus) to Zurich with Austria Airlines via Vienna so were very pleased to be able to fly direct once again with Edelweiss Air. Excellent flights both ways with first class service and friendly crew. Both flights arrived early. Hope Edelweiss/Swiss continue this route next summer.

Zurich - Mykonos return. Great crew outstanding food and wines enough space in business as middle seat not sold. We are Gold Members on Star Alliance and OneWord and always look forward to fly with Edelweiss - perfect start for a holiday and you feel really welcome and appreciated as a pax on this airline.

ZRH-CUN-ZRH. The onward Economy flight was just great. Seats were a bit worn but comfy. The Inflight Entertainment consists only of some audio channels. No individual screens so no individual movies no games just two movies on the big screens - unsatisfactory. But the food was great a tasty main dish and lots of ice cream and sandwiches during the flight. Also the crew was friendly and efficient. I consider the inflight economy product on Edelweiss apart from the in-flight entertainment better than the Swiss economy on long haul. But definitely not so the "Relax" Class on the return flight which is also sold by Swiss as Business Class. We decided to do so because the flight back was a night flight and we wanted to sleep - it's a complete waste of money. There was separate and fast check-in at Cancun but we had the same latest check-in time than economy what a joke. When we asked for the lounge we were told that there wasn't any for Edelweiss Passengers. That definitely was not a joke. Once aboard the seats looked like old economy seats some 30 years ago. Small ridiculous seat pitch of not even 39 inch that's just 7 inch more than on economy. It was a bit reclinable but probably not more than 45°. I could not stretch my legs and it was impossible to sleep. There were only few newspapers and 2 low-quality gossip magazines. What was not a good alternative to the 6 movies offered in the media player distributed at the beginning of the flight. The only highlight was the food and the drinks offered they were very good. And again the crew were friendly and nice although a bit slow - the first course was served 90 minutes after take-off. But on my opinion not only the passengers but also the crew deserves a better product than this so called "relax" class probably they feel very embarrassed to work in such an ambiance. Swiss should be ashamed to sell something like this as Business Class.

ATH-ZRH in economy class. Surprised to fly on a Swiss flight operated by Edelweiss but more surprised and charmed by the excellent quality of service friendly crew. The hot food was exceptional.

Phuket to Zurich A330-300. The outbound flight on time and aircraft clean and confortable. Good breakfast and hot lunch with perfect service. The cabin crew were friendly and very efficient. Nice snack before landing in Zurich ice cream during movie and countless passes with the drink trolley. Very good airline.

EDW ZRH-CLB-MLE on the 6th feb. and MLE-ZRH on the 14th feb both in Y class. Outbound night flight with hot diner and breakfast. Perfect service friendly staff clean and confortable A330. One negative point on the night flight is that they wake up passengers 2h30 before landing in CLB very annoying. Then one hour stopover in CLB remaining on board. And 1h15 flight to MLE serving sandwiches. Return flight hot lunch Mövenpick ice cream during movie sandwiches before landing and countless passes with the drink trolley. All in all perfect airline with a great level of service and food quality. This charter airline is way better than many legacy carriers around Europe.

We flew Edelweissair to Cancun (Mexico) in in their Business Class. Business class was 1000 Dollar cheaper then on American Airlines or Iberia. Very personal and friendly service. Excellent menu they even served fresh Ice Cream in cones! Nice snack before landing in Orlando (stopover). The only negative point was this stop in the United States. Security checks were very annoying.

I flew Edelweiss to Antalya a couple of days ago and back on its only A-330. The service was excellent and cabin crew very friendly. More movies would have been great. The plane was flown by CEO Kistler on the leg to Antalya. Unfortunately check-in at Antalya took relatively long since only 3 counters were open for an A-330-flight.

I have been flying Edelweiss Air twice since last year from Zurich airport and I have never had any problems of any kind. The staff were friendly and efficient the flights were on time and the aircraft (A320) were clean and modern. Two weeks ago I flew ZRH-JMK (Mykonos) in Comfort Class. You just have to pay an additional fee of CHF 100.- one way and you can sit at rows 1 to 3 - the service is better and you don't have to pay for alcoholic beverages. To my opinion Edelweiss Air is an excellent airline considering the fact that it is a charter airline.
