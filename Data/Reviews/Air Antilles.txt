### "a very traumatic experience"
Not Verified |  Atrocious customer service (the landline never answered), online complaint form never answered or vaguely answered or rarely answered. They also remove, amend, cancel what you have type on their online form (what they call e-ticket) so as to hide their suspicious activities or behaviour. You have to fight to get your money back (if you still have energy left after 3 months of constant harassment from me let alone 1 year) if it happens that you need to claim a refund. It has been a very traumatic experience for me and as far as I'm concerned this would be the last time I will be taking this airline.

### "constant maintenance issues"
This airline has constant maintenance issues, the plane on arrival lost one engine. The replacement plane came in late, we were told they were in touch with the connecting airline, someone would be getting us from the plane and immediately escort us to the connecting flight. They confirmed multiple times that the connecting airline would hold. When we landed, we saw the connecting flight pull away from the gate. The connection was only available once per week. They would take no responsibility, we had to buy a ticket to another airport (Fort-de-France) to catch a connection to our destination the next day. Change fees, extra ticket, hotel for the night, taxi, food, etc. cost us $500 per person. Air Antilles lied to us every step along the way and did not cover a penny of the extra expenses they were responsible for. Do not fly this airline.

### "This airline is disgusting"
Point-à-pitre to Saint Martin. This airline is disgusting. They have no respect for people or their time. They are the most unhelpful and rudest people we have ever encountered on an airline. They were unwilling to help us try to book an earlier flight, after discovering the plane was delayed two hours which would have made us late for an unexpected funeral we were to attend. Then, even though it was two hours late, they still made us go into the boarding zone, where there was no food and only warm bottles of water in an expensive vending machine. Once, the plane was finally nearing boarding time, they announced another hour of delay. Delays are common and sometimes unavoidable, However, the rudeness and complete lack of help is unacceptable. We not only felt like we were receiving attitude because we were white, we also just felt that they didn’t feel like dealing with us because they were too busy eating lunch. Unacceptable. Do not fly with them. We should not be giving them our hard earned money.

### "pleasant and relaxed flight"
My first experience with this regional airline on a short hop from Point-a-Pietre to Melville Hall. Very pleasant and relaxed flight, nice staff and decent leg and hand luggage space. Will be happy to fly with them at any time again.
