### "think twice before booking with Volaris"
I wasn’t able to fly with Volaris on March 30, 2025, at 4:45 PM because they overbooked the flight and canceled two of the three seats I had booked months in advance—one for my brother and one for my sister. While my seat was still available, I obviously wasn’t going to fly without them. Volaris made no effort to resolve the issue and offered absolutely no assistance. To make matters worse, they didn’t provide compensation, a hotel stay, food, or any kind of support. I was forced to book a last-minute flight with another airline for the next day since there were no available flights that same night. This cost me over $2,000, plus an extra $100 for food and drinks while I had to stay up all night and all day at the airport. We were stranded there for over 14 hours, and during this time, both of my siblings suffered from dehydration due to the lack of proper rest and resources. The lack of professionalism and customer service from Volaris was beyond frustrating. This was my first experience with them, and it will definitely be my last. I strongly advise others to think twice before booking with Volaris.

### "arrived 20 minutes before departure"
We arrived 20 minutes before departure time, and they denied us boarding. First and last time we will use Volaris. Had to pay 160 USD to the next flight If you account for hours guaranteed delays and money extorted, they're not a budget airline at all. Crazy stuff. I don't care about delays, uncomfortable seats.

### "such an unfair treatment"
Flew with Volaris from Oaxaca to LAX on April 19, 2024 (flight# 7848). I bought my ticket from Expedia site. When I went to get my boarding card, the female attendant told me that I have to pay 960.00 Pesos ($ 100.41) for my carry on. She was not that comfortable with her English, and nobody was speaking English in that airport for that matter! I put the charge on my credit card because I didn’t want to miss my flight and couldn’t communicate with lady at the checkin counter. I noticed that other passengers were carrying their carry -on luggage (the same size as mine) to the airplane and didn’t pay any fee. Furthermore, since it was an international flight, I could have checked in my carry- on at no charge which is customary with international flights. I was treated unfairly and that left a bad taste in my mouth about this airline. I expected them to refund my money in US Dollars after reviewing my email and supporting attachments. Not refunding me for such an unfair treatment has forced me to leave this negative comments about this airline.

### "they didn’t care about helping"
Not Verified |   Volaris emailed us twice over the past 10 months to say that our flight was cancelled and we need to rebook, but after complaining, the flight wasn’t cancelled and we had our original seats. Twice, months apart. Day of service no plane arrived to take folks home and the ticket and gate agents literally ran away and hid in the back rooms rather than face many hundreds of customers they didn’t care about helping. Refunds never granted. No live customer service just chatbots that instantly fail. Rumor is now Mexican government is going to shut them down. They deserve it.

### “I was not returned the money”
I highly recommend not using the services of this company, since its systems are designed in such a way that you can easily lose money irrevocably. In my case, I lost 470 USD on purchasing a return ticket. In the interface of their system, I chose a tariff with the Full Refund feature, and when a couple of days later I applied for a refund, they told me that this was impossible because some rules had been violated. In the correspondence, I found out that the money can only be returned within 24 hours from the date of purchase (there are still a lot of points, but I was not returned the money based on this), but it is impossible to find these restrictions at the time of purchase for a ticket in the system, and there are no footnotes on these restrictions are nowhere to be found, and support does not consider this a problem, which I believe means this is intended. It’s unclear what other pitfalls there are, but I’m sure where there is one there are others. It is better not to have deals with this company at all, but if there are no alternatives, then I recommend that before performing any operations you contact their support service and find out if there are any restrictions for the operation you are about to perform.

### "told I can't help you""
Not Verified | Trying to make a reservation with this airline is frustrating. Tried booking online. I needed to add a checked bag but it would not allow me. I tried through volaris.com and many other booking options. Frustrating I tried calling their customer service line which took forever only to be told "I can't help you".

### "totally ruined our family trip"
Worst experience ever! We arrived Los Angeles international airport 3 hours earlier for a Volaris flight and finally missed it, because Volaris counter people claimed that THEY DONT SPEAK ENGLISH and directed us to different lines which didn’t move at all! We were placed on the next days flight and lost $900 cost of rental, hotel, and activities we had booked. Be aware that they charge $200 for check in luggage and $80 for a piece of carry-on. And we were charged twice for the same piece of luggage. When we called their customer service number they said they couldn’t refund! This company totally ruined our family trip!

### "No one notified me that my flight was canceled"
No one notified me that my flight was canceled today December 27, 2023 T 6:21 AM. I got at the airport at 4:45 AM, and my flight was canceled and moved to 5:21 PM instead 6:21 AM. I was not able to re-schedule, awful and disgusting. I checked myself and I asked the employee why my flight was canceled and he mentioned (because weather conditions) and I asked him where ? San Salvador and Costa rica is around 80F degrees and he did not change his statement. I have small luggage and did not fit the measures and mentioned need to go under the airplane, and will cost me $100 absolutely awful. When I paid I provided a gift card American express credit card, the employee try over 10 minutes to put through the card in the system and he was not able to do it, I gave him my personal American express and went through. Being on seat B2, and for my cancelation with out noticed I was expecting some sympathy, but all the employees were cold stone, and not friendly people.

### "They are terrible!"
Not Verified |  They are terrible! They are a scam. I booked my flight from Tijuana to Los Mochis a few months in advance. I traveled from Wisconsin all the way to San Diego to use the CBX to fly through Tijuana as it was the cheapest route for me. I make it to Tijuana to find out that I was put on standby because they overbooked the flight. The people at the desk were so rude and could care less to help me. They couldnt put me on the next available flight. Not only did I miss my nieces Quinceañera and now Christmas is ruined, but I am stranded in San Diego because I could not afford a flight back to Wisconsin. To make things worse they wont refund me my flight when the people at the airport guaranteed me a refund but of course they were going to give me a number to call instead of working with me in person! So now they are making up any excuse as to not give me my money back. The airline told me , “well the flight operated as scheduled” so we wont give you a refund. Don't waste your time on this useless airline. They just want your money.

### "no frills good airline"
Volaris is starting to grow on me. It is quickly becoming my favourite Mexican airline. The no-fuss booking procedure and easy-to-understand (and reasonably priced) baggage options are just some of the perks this airline offers. They are just a good all-around no fuss - no frills good airline.

### "refused to change or cancel the reservation"
Not Verified |  My wife and I have a reservation to fly from LAX to Morelia in December for Christmas. My wife has to fly to Europe unexpectedly, so I need to change her reservation. Volaris refused to change or cancel the reservation, even though the flight is weeks away. Will never fly with Volaris again and just canceled our Volaris credit card.

### “they were not friendly at all”
Not Verified |  Worst service ever. The company lets us know that they won’t bring the luggage to our destination, I traveled for 4 days and they did not bring my luggage in my flight. When arriving they were not friendly at all and didn’t show any care for our loss and didn’t compensate in any way.

### Volaris customer review
Not Verified |  Poorly run airline. Got bumped from our 1am flight despite checking in 2 hours prior. We were told the plane had been switched for a smaller craft. Alternatives were from airports 2-5 hours away and arrived a day and a half later than intended. Will never book again and would actively advocate against this poorly run airline. Friendly customer rep though.

### "Never fly this horrendous airline"
Never fly this horrendous airline. They will change the day of your flight even if you reserved a different day and show you no compassion when you need to get somewhere on a certain day. I’ve never received an issue or service like this. They even have my original flight for today and still won’t give it to me! Will never fly with them again.

### "Terrible customer service"
Terrible customer service. I missed my flight and they didn’t announce my name. Instead when I addressed this with the counter, the supervisor on duty made fun of me instead and started talking about me in Spanish with his co workers. They didn’t offer any compassion. Instead of being kind, they were extremely rude and made everything for the next 4 hours a nightmare in reclaiming my baggage.

### "Terrible customer service"
During Hurricane Norma, Volaris contacted us via email requesting us to volunteer our seats and offered us a later flight at no charge. Since our other family members flights were canceled and we wanted to continue traveling together and we just experienced a Hurricane, we accepted their offer and selected the same return flights as our family members. We contacted Volaris customer service via telephone 3 times to confirm the information given was accurate. We were told to go to the airport, show the email where we accepted their offer and they would print us new boarding passes at no cost. We were also told it should only take a few minutes and no need to take our luggage. our seats have already been offered to standbys. It took over an hour. We paid an Uber a $100 to take us there and wait for us. Once we got there Volaris rescinded their offer and we had to pay for new flights and were recharged baggage fees. Nothing they told us was true. They sold our seats and we had to pay for new flights. Terrible customer service in person and over the phone.

### "Will not recommend them"
Not Verified |  Hurricane Norma was active while I was there but not yet had arrived to where I was located. This airline called me so that I can sell my ticket out. I said no, why? Well this company had the nerve to cancel my ticket, without my saying. Then I tried using my paid ticket, they told me I had to purchase one. I have mine. So I had to buy me my way out again. I never saw a refund. Do not fly Volaris! Plus cancellations were crazy. Too many going on. I lost my paid flight, ridiculous. Will not recommend them.

### "How many people has she scammed before?"
Not Verified |  While waiting in LA to board my flight to Guadalajara the staff called my name to come up. I went to see them and they rudely ignored me. Finally, after some time, one of the staff told me I had to pay a $40usd visa fee. First off, I am from Canada and we are exempt from tourist visa fees, secondly, I had a resident visa in my passport for which I was traveling to Guadalajara to get my resident card. I showed her my visa and she kept saying I need a card and it's not valid. None of this made any sense. Eventually she called her supervisor after making a scene and admitted she was wrong. The whole thing was suspicious as if she was just trying to squeeze $40 out of me like a dumb tourist. How many people has she scammed before? Or was she just completely incompetent. Either way I will never fly with this trash excuse for an airline again.

### "We had wasted six hours at the terminal"
Not Verified |  First, we were not able to check in online. We arrived at the airport three hours prior to boarding time. However, check-in took an hour and a half. There were just a few staff working at the counter. Upon check-in, we were told that there was a problem with our checkin and they have to change our flight flying to El Salvador and then back to LA. There was no explanation whatsoever. I think it is due to the fact we could not check in online and they gave our seats to other passengers and we had to take another flight. We had wasted six hours at the terminal and at LA we had to spend another $30 for Uber because we missed the airplane shuttle.

### "customer support is non existent"
The worst airline you can ever take. Don’t even think about purchasing a ticket with them. It is trouble from the very beginning to the end. Can’t make check in, everything costs extra, customer support is non existent.

### "I am very disappointed"
First of all, this was third time Volaris damaged my surfboard. When I made a claim with pictures, they issued me a voucher of $2,000 pesos (mexican pesos). I had to use this credit voucher within 12months, I decided to purchase round trip tickets for sep 2023. When I tried to apply the voucher number, it showed only $1,000 pesos available. I called the customer service but they didn't see $2,000 pesos even thou I have email from volaris stating that I was receiving $2,000 pesos for the damage they caused. I decided to use 1,000 pesos which was all the available credit amount (don't know what happened to $2,000 they originally stated) to purchase the tickets. Then I emailed volaris but they don't seem to understand or they just don't want to admit that they ripped me off for $1,000 pesos I haven't used. Then I attached pictures of my new tickets with cost and screen shot of email regards to $2,000 pesos credit voucher originally they issued. I haven't heard from them since. Volaris doesn't take care of passenger luggage and they reduced the amount of credit they issued. I am very disappointed and I would like to warn people not to fly with them, if you have any other choices.

### "Employees are rude"
Not Verified |  Employees are rude. Could not check in online, tried about 5 times so I figured I would get my boarding pass at the gate since I wasn't checking a bag anyway. My flight into Los Angeles was delayed and I got to the gate right when they started to board. I explained to the agent what happened and asked her to print a boarding pass. She told me the flight was closed and she wouldn't do it, said I had to go to ticket counter on the other side of the airport to get boarding pass, I would not have made it back in time. I had a seat and a reservation. So I asked could I get a later flight maybe for the next day. Without looking at the computer she told me no! Said nothing was available until 3 more days! Without looking at the computer! So I was stranded at LAX at midnight! Had to call a family member to come and pick me up. Not a good thing for a 75 year old woman. So now I'm out $684 dollars! Because they won't give me a refund. I don't care how cheap they are, I will never fly Volaris! Would I recommend this airline? No!

### "the worst airline ever"
Not Verified |  This is the worst airline ever, they don't care about customers, the employees are  ignorant, they don't even know how to organize a line. They do not listen that all. I will never buy a ticket again with them. Prefer pay more but with better service.

### "customer service, delays and frustration"
Not Verified |  Don't buy the business combo or flexibility or any of the options that allow you to change flight dates. They will make you call in to change the flight, and charge you the "difference" between an old ticket and a new ticket. this is more than the cost of a new ticket! Customer service is basically like talking to a frustrating robot who have pre-scripted lines and are unable to deviate from the scripts. Its like talking to AI that doesn't really understand you and gives answers that don't inform you of the policies nor help solve a solution. You might save a couple bucks on the fare, but you will more than pay for it in time on the phone, customer service, delays and frustration.

### "treated with disrespect"
Flight was delayed by weather and they changed gate departure at last minute, I understand this can happen so no biggie. The staff and flight was fine till the end. The plane had stopped at gate, engine off, passenger in rows ahead started to get up, so I did, same as I have done on hundreds of flights. So imagine my shock when she runs down to me and slams luggage compartment shut in my face, no explanation and walks back up. I stayed standing in shock, the passengers around me are shocked and murmur privileged first. So I can say that first flight will be my last, Buy tickets on this airline only if you want to be treated with disrespect. I had just been on 2 Aero Mexico flights that were superior and the staff excellent!

### "No one took responsibility"
Volaris left one of my bags in the wrong cart and my luggage never made it from Guadalajara to Tijuana. When addressing the issue with the attendant said he would call a supervisor. After waiting for over 3hrs without being able to sit, eat, or drink anything they said a gal who stood and watched me wait was the supervisor. She said she already gave me my resolution and basically said my luggage was in another plane. They refused to ship it to my address and they said I had to return for it if I didn’t want to wait. I also explained that I had my car at CBX and this inconvenience is not only costing me time but also money. They offered me a $,1000 pesos voucher which is like $50 US dollars. They did not want to fix my parking fees although CBX is stationed inside the airport. I did not take the voucher as I never plan to travel through CBX or Volaris. The airport representatives also treated the situation as a joke and continued to refer me to the airline. No one took responsibility for this terrible inconvenience. Their staff were sarcastic, rude, and lacked empathy for my inconvenience. Lost luggage cost me a total of a 5 hour wait, humiliation, hunger, parking fees, and no money one here to hold someone responsible.

### "Customer service is a joke"
Not Verified | VOLARIS is a nightmare! Customer service is a joke! If you decide to fly with VOLARIS be prepared to be stranded and not be notified of any changes of any any kind . Volaris is the worst airline. To top it off when you manage to get a hold of a real person all they do is give you the run around and after they hang up on you !

### "It's a nightmare"
Not Verified |  This airline has the worst customer service. They are not well trained to provide information, the airline work ethic is just the worst because they don't care about their customers. Flights get cancelled all the time and they do not inform the clients forcing us to stay at the airport countless hours. They don't provide hotel vouchers for families with small children. Their policies are money oriented where clients don't get reimbursed or credited for cancellations due to weather conditions. I don't understand why are they allowed to operate in the United States. DO NOT use this airline. It's a nightmare!

### "one of the worst airlines"
This is one of the worst airlines that I have ever traveled on. The flight attendants give you rude stares and seem to loathe their job. The in flight snacks are damn expensive, so make sure to bring your own snacks from the airport into the plane. There is no entertainment whatsoever, not even magazines, so make sure to bring a book or something. I knew it would be cheap, but I didn’t think it would be cheap enough to the point where they would not use their air conditioner. The entire flight was humid inside, and keep in mind that the cabins are extremely cramped. Additionally, when it was time to deplane, I tripped and slammed my back on the stairs as I was lifting my father’s luggage. No one even bothered to help me out with the luggage or for me to get up. And don’t even get me started on the service at the airport - it was slow. We spent a good 3 hours just waiting to leave the airport in Oxcaca. Please, if you want a pleasant experience traveling over to Mexico, do NOT fly with Volaris!

### "Their behavior is appalling"
Twice in one trip they boarded us knowing there was a maintenance issue. Then deplaned and delayed us for hours. They lied about resolutions and refused to give concrete answers when asked direct questions about an updated departure. Employee behavior is unprofessional across the board. We drove from Texas to Monterrey to fly out enticed by the savings but have been robbed over a day of our vacation. We will be spending the extra money to fly a more expensive carrier direct next time. Their behavior is appalling. But it’s okay. We got $6 for a snack while we waited for our next flights.

### "never use this airline again"
Not Verified |  My flight from Tijuana to Cabo was delayed 4.5 hrs. Minimal notification from airlines and only compensation was a $40 voucher to be used on another flight within 1 month. They offered a dry ham sandwich which was stale and not appetizing. It was thrown away no other meal compensation given. The flight from Cabo to Tijuana was also delayed this time 5.5 hours. No communication from airlines. This is unacceptable for an airline. I will never use this airline again and urge all my friends to do the same. It appears that delays are very common as other Volaris fights were delayed same day. The airline staff did not seem apologetic to these significant and very disruptive delays.

### "Avoid at all cost"
Horrible flight. I got a cancelled flight during Thanksgiving. Okay, that’s fine, I didn’t get compensated but I can handle it. Then, in February, my flight got delayed by 5 hours late at night. 10pm flight turns to a 2.30am flight. How do they repay us? Giving us a $150 pesos ($7 USD) to Wings, a very overpriced food place. Food is like 2/10 and they charge us ridiculous overpriced food. It took them one hour to even get our order, 30 minutes to give us the food, and another hour to get the check. Actually, we were tired of waiting and when we were about to walk out is when they wanted to suddenly serve us. We have to pay an extra $188 pesos because the food is way more than the $150 voucher. After that horrible restaurant experience, we are still waiting for our flight. Avoid at all cost.

### "still not been refunded"
Not Verified |  Avoid at all Costs. You deserve to be treated with a minimal level of respect and consideration even on a discount airline. You will not find that on Volaris. Volaris cancelled my confirmed ticket, in error, back in June 2022. It is now mid February and my money has still not been refunded. No one is willing to assume responsibility - that includes assuming responsibility to help a passenger resolve a problem. Also, unless you speak fluent Spanish, you receive even less cooperation from Volaris.

### "This airline is terrible"
Not Verified | This airline is terrible. They gave us issues on the way to Cancun and on the way back when it came to paying for luggage. They wouldn’t accept 5 of our credit cards. And when we called our credit card company they said everything is fine. Our credit cards worked everywhere else. Then they refused to help us and told us we can only pay with cash but we didn’t have any left. It’s a scam and such a terrible airline. I refuse to ever fly with them.

### "Worst airline to fly"
Not Verified |  Worst airline to fly! We got there 3 hours before our plane would take off and when we got there they informed us that we had no tickets because they had sold them to someone else! Volaris will over sell and then its first come first serve basically! This is so unfair they wanted my family and I to stay one more week even though we mentioned we had to go back to work! If I wouldn’t have put my foot down and stood my ground they would have walked all over us just how they did to so many people that day! I flew yesterday January 16 2023. I will never fly with them again and hopefully a lot of people stop as well because they are taking advantage of so many people specially most hispanics that don't know their rights! This is unacceptable!

### "charge me $160.00 dollar for luggage"
Their customer service sucks, employees are so impolite, rude, they charge me $160.00 dollar for luggage. I need it a wheelchair and they refuse to provide it. Plus, if the customer services desk helps us check in, they will charge $15.00 to help. Also, person who work for the airport are asking for tips now. I did a stop in Guadalajara to Mexico City. I got charge $1200 pesos again for luggage. I arrived in Mexico to find out I got a lot of things stolen from inside my luggage. I'm really mad. Please avoid this airline.

### "getting charged extra for seats"
If you like waiting in lines for multiple hours, getting charged extra for seats, luggage, and carryon, having flight delayed or even gate changes with no notice and no communication from anyone please fly Volaris. This will be your best flight ever…

### "Their service is terrible"
Do NOT take this airline. They are fraud. They charge you exuberant price for any size luggage. Their service is terrible and their employees are rude. Their aircraft are in bad shape.

### "What a horrible experience!"
What a horrible experience! Both outbound and returning flights were cancelled with no notice. On the Outbound flight to Oaxaca, we waited in line 90 minutes before we were told the flight had been cancelled, then were bumped to a flight 8 hours later, which meant we got to spend the day at Mexico City airport outside of security with our luggage. Our return flight was even worse! It was cancelled and rescheduled for 2 days later! Of course, we had connecting flights in Mexico City that did not allow us to delay 2 days, so we had to book a OAX-MEX flight with Aeromexico (which was outstanding!). Customer service with Volaris is non-existent, and back in the US they told us they would not give us any type of refund - only a voucher.

### "lowest quality experience possible"
1. Flight from LAX was delayed by at least two hours. 2. Barely enough room for your legs (I’m only 5’6, not like I’m a giant) 3. Because our LAX flight was delayed, we missed our connecting flight. They originally told us they had no other flights till 4 days from then. Finally, after 2 hours at a counter, we were given another flight for that same day (how funny, we thought you didn’t have any flights till 4 days from now). 4. Our second flight got delayed by over 3 hours. 5. They allowed people to overstuff the overhead bin compartments. These people try to get as much money out of you as possible while giving you the lowest quality experience as possible.

### "Absolute disregard for the customer"
Not Verified | Worst airline!! Volaris does not care about its customers. We could not check in online unless we paid an additional $200 per seat. We booked our flights in October. Arrived at the airport 3 hrs. Before our flight to be told that they had sold our tickets because we did not check in online. After explaining and asking why our seats are not available, the only solution was to fly out of LAX at 1AM the next day and no compensation for hotel rooms and transportation. Absolute disregard for the customer! I’m rating 1 star because it’s not possible to assign negative stars! !

### "Service was rude and incompetent"
Not Verified | Cancelled the flight we reserved months before a few days before the wedding we were attending to. No explanation just seems to be their usual ways. Service was rude and incompetent, took about two months to get my money back. By the time they cancelled the flight all other flights were full and prices skyrocketed. Not their problem, they just returned the amount we paid months ago, even if we could no longer get anything around that price. They gave us a fishy 20% or so credit. It was a yet another scam, hardly usable for my family since you need to activate it, it’s issued per passenger, and it expires days after, and only covers the main passenger of your next reservation, so I would need to do different reservations for myself, my wife and each of our kids. The only good thing was that after adding the very basic (hand luggage and seat), we realized their “sale” price became higher than that of a real airline, even after their fishy credits and so called discount, so we realized there wasn’t any reason for us to even consider flying Volaris ever again.

### "delayed on departure by 4 hours"
Not Verified | My relatives and I flew out of Tijuana Airport to Cancun on Christmas Eve. We are a group of 10 and first if all the flight was delayed on departure by 4 hours, then the worst was going to happen to us. They lost my luggage, and two of my cousins suitcases. We get informed that our luggage will arrive the next day of our arrival. So far we are on day 3 of not getting out stuff with all our clothes, shoes, essentials, etc. Volaris has been terrible and do not advise what flight has our things (luggage). We keep contacting them with no resolve. No indication that they will reimburse us for our losses of our things. This is the absolute worst airline ever. I have flown to all kinds of other airlines, like American Airlines, Southwest, Hawaiian Airlines and have never had any issues whatsoever. I would highly recommend NOT using this airline ever.

### "No help in customer service"
Not Verified |  Volaris airline never called or emailed telling us that our flight was cancelled and changed for to days later. There was no voucher or reimbursement. No help in customer service for Volaris which wont answer there calls. If I could give this a zero I would.

### "received no refund or credit"
Not Verified |  I've been flying Volaris since inception and watched as they've devolved into the worst airline I know. In the past three years in particular Volaris has put all it's efforts into shaking every penny and peso out of the customer while becoming the least on-time airline in the Americas. But this last experience was the one that made me say, I'll never fly Volaris again. We were checked in, had paid for Premium seats, and were traveling with carry-on bags and small personal items (purse and briefcase). We got to the gate early but waited to be among the last in line as is our preference. When we got to the agent to scan our tickets she told all passengers they were going to weigh our carry-ons again before we could board. To my surprise they had a small portable scale at the ramp. We were ordered to put our carry-ons on the scale and mine was just at weight. Them the agent told me to put my briefcase on top of the carry-on, which cause me to be two kilos over. Same with my girlfriend and other passengers. I argued that what they were doing was not only unfair but causing the flight to be delayed as they had just one person collecting payment. I was told to pay up or forfeit my flight. So I offered my credit card (as did almost all other passengers) and was told this was cash only- and in pesos. I did not have pesos. The woman in front of us also didn't have enough in pesos, so we each offered $100 bills and were told in the most rude manner that we would not be able to board our flight. We missed that flight, received no refund or credit. What I noticed was that there was no receipt being given. Here they have a portable scale but no credit card machine? I asked to speak with the supervisor at the airport and went to see her. She was the same person that barred us from our flight and was demanding cash. I tried to file a complaint but Volaris has no such department or oversight at all. I tried for some time to reach someone to tell my story and have never been contacted in return or received any follow up at all from Volaris.

### "Worst airline I've ever used"
Not Verified |  Flight delayed for nearly two hours, staff are rude aggressive and unhelpful. Missed Airbnb check in because of delay, which means I'll be sleeping at the airport and losing 1300 pesos. Worst airline I've ever used. Avoid Volaris

### "I will never fly with Volaris again"
Scammers work at all counters Went to the counter to board flight to Costa Rica and was met with complete disrespect from staff who works at the counter. They quoted me three different prices basically what is the baggage prices more expensive than what it says online. They tried to charge me $229 dollars for my bag. The online website says $50 max! She told me my flight was closed and then I couldn’t board even though it was delayed by two hours. Another family traveling from the UK with three kids who waited for an hour trying to board. She was absolutely terrible and no one at the counter in the Cancun airport was professional. When we asked to speak to a manager she acted like she didn’t speak English. I will never go to Mexico or travel through Mexico again based on this experience. I will never fly with Volaris again. Absolutely terrible people working for this company

### "Never flying with you again"
Had a terrible experience with them. Stood in line for 4 hours just to get kicked out of the plane because it was overbooked. Lost my flight and had to get another one. Then after arriving on my destination they lost my baggage. I left without it and have been dealing with it for 2 days and not gotten it back. They don't make any effort to ship them. It seems like I gotta wait another 2 days until they arrive. Lets see if that is even gonna happen. Never flying with you again

### "Awful service!"
Not Verified |  Awful service! We booked our flight months in advance and they overbooked and kicked us out of the flight last minute. Awful communication because they gave us hope and shut the doors in our face. Disappointing and infuriating because we are a family of 4 with various meetings due the next day that had to be canceled. They wasted our time, money and I will never be buying from them again. If I were you, save yourself from this awful company that only disappoints.

### "Fly with a more reliable carrier"
Not Verified |  Total and complete scammers! We were charged $80 for a carry on at the check in desk! They told us to add it online on our return flight to avoid the charge. The app won't allow us to add any bags, we called customer service, after being hung up on 4 times, the 5th person said he can't add the bags, that we have to do it at the desk! So they basically force you to pay $80 for carry on and $151 for checked bags. They tell you that you have options to pay less but then don't make those options available to you! Avoid this airline at all costs. Fly with a more reliable carrier.

### "the worst customer service"
They lost my backpack on the transfer through Mexico city .. at least it showed up on next day but i still don’t have it as they want me to collect it again on the airport. but what can i do? It was not my fault to lose my own baggage, at least they could bring it to my hotel I'm staying, but obviously they can’t deliver. Also they’re not able to deliver it on a Sunday, because they’re not working on Sunday, but still they operate flights on every day. This is the worst customer service I've ever experienced.

### "I do not recommend it"
This airline is the worst that I have experienced, I do not recommend it, it is the 3 time that my flight has been canceled this week without informing me, the customer service is lousy, they treat their customers lousy, they do not give me a solution, please do not fly with that airline. Esta aerolínea es lo peor que e experimentado no la recomiendo es la 3 vez q me cancela mi vuelo en esta semana sin informarme la atención al cliente es pésima tratan pésimo a sus clientes no me dan una solución por favor no vuelen con esa aerolínea

### "This airline is awful"
This airline is awful. We tried to check into our flight online using their website, but it wouldn't let us. So we decided we would check in at the airport. When we got to the airport we waited in the check-in line for 40 minutes. There was only one employee working the check-in line, and they were taking super long to help people. They also kept disappearing for 10 minutes after helping someone. Meanwhile there were about 5 employees just standing around, not doing anything. They were directing people to wait in line, and talking to themselves. It was a stupid use of resources. A lot of people in line were complaining. When it was finally our turn, the employee told us casually that our flight was cancelled and we can take the next flight in 8 hours. We did not receive any text, email, or call about our cancellation. If we knew the flight was cancelled we would not have shown up to the airport so early. We ended up spending around 12 hours at the airport for no reason. Once we got to the gate for our flight, it kept getting delayed because the plane still had not arrived. It was so frustrating. It took forever for us to get boarded. Unfortunately we also had booked with Volaris for another flight from Oaxaca to Merida. And of course the flight was delayed by 1 hour 30 mins, but they didn't mention anything about the flight being delayed. So again we showed up to the airport earlier than needed. It's very frustrating but we didn't say anything because we were not in a rush. When we started boarding the stupidest possible thing occurred. At the very last second as we were boarding, the employee told us we need to weigh our bags. I do not know why they waited until we were at the front of the line, as we are boarding, to make us weigh our bags, when the flight was already delayed by so long. After we weighed our bags they told us we need to move some 10kg from one bag to a different bag, or pay $750 pesos. They really wanted us to sit there and try to move 10kg from one bag to another. That is completely ridiculous. The bags are normal travel size and fit perfectly. We argued with the employee but they wouldn't budge. They held up the entire line and pressured us so that we had to pay the stupid fee. It was so unnecessary because both the bags were going onto the carry on spot anyways. They just charged us a fee and scammed us. It literally made no difference because we still boarded with the same bags and same weight in the bags. This airline is horrible. Do not book with this airline if you do not have to. They delay flights consistently. They will cancel flights and merge them with much later flights to save themselves money.

### "I hope volaris can do better"
On our way back to the United States I had my younger sister, grandmother and aunt with me. It already started off bad when the lady at the counter said that my sister wouldn’t be able to receive her ticket because we simply didn’t put her second last name. Though that lady was really understanding, it was when the time to get on the plane that angered me and people around me. They had switched the plane number stations last minute without telling anyone. The counter people were rushing us and hurrying us and even end up yelling at me and my sister pushing us to the side separating me and my grandmother which is what i was trying to avoid as she cannot read or write. I had tried asking for help as it was the first time flying and without my parents to help guide us. Counter lady was yelling at everyone but didn’t want to help because she wanted everyone on the plane at a certain time even though they started check ins very late. We then encountered the same issue again about my sisters ticket not having her second last name and when i tried explaining to the lady that the people downstairs said it was fine she kept interrupting me asking for my last name. I was visibly frustrated as i was already separated from my grandmother. As i was able to meet up with my grandmother a lady behind me was complaining about the same thing about being rushed. We both talked about it as it was frustrating because many of these people are boarding with grandparents and are doing double the work with their own ticket and their grandparents ticket. I hope volaris can do better as it just looks like that the attendants feel special and higher up than everyone around them.

### "This airline is unreliable"
I should have learned from my siblings. They got stranded by Volaris in December. I booked four tickets for my mother (who flew from Los Angeles to Mexico City)and family members that she was visiting. They showed up to the airport in Tapachula Mexico, and were told there were no reservation. My credit card had been charged and everything was supposed to be good to go. I called the customer service and the gentleman was useless. All he said, there was a problem with your card and you need to rebook. I was flaming hot. I explained my card had already been charged and he said, there's nothing he can do because that's a finance issue. I asked him to connect me to them, he said he couldn't. He said my money would be returned and it was a week later. How can there be an issue if they refunded my money? This airline is unreliable. My siblings had similar experience. Pay a little more and skip Volaris.

### "stay away from Volaris"
Not Verified |  Real good chance you're gonna get burned by this airline I would stay far away. I waited a couple of months for airline fees to go down and get a round trip with them from San Antonio to Huatulco Mexico for $475. when I went to check in to start the trip they wanted to charge me 15 bucks to print a ticket since I hadn't done it online. that was an omen. Then on the plane you find out they're charging you for the little bag of peanuts and a soda. Made it down there OK and when it was time to return to San Antonio I I found out they oversold the flight and I couldn't get on and they wouldn't do anything about it at all it was horrible. Their solution was to send me down the counter to Aeromexico and I had to pay them 300 bucks to get to Mexico City before I got back on Volaris to go to San Antonio. But I had to do that when you have people watching your house and your pets you can't get back one or two days later when they have to be at work and school. I could've just spent $800 and gone with a class carrier like Aeromexico in the first place. A really stressful situation and horrible and being down there in a different country there was nothing I can do about it except pay more to Aeromexico to get back in time. Take my advice and stay away from Volaris it's only a matter time you'll get burned by them. Just go with a better airline like Aeromexico or whoever you choose that won't charge you for tickets at the counter and peanuts and sodas on the plane and leave you stranded.

### "Never again Volaris"
At the gate B-18 two staff from this airline asked to line up and weighted our luggage and asked people to pay. I did pay 1500.00 Mexican pesos approximately. Due to the chaos and many people surrounding the desk the lady asked to pay and proceeded to place a tag in may luggage. They did not gave me a receipt or anything and I was able to fly to Guadalajara. In Guadalajara when I was about to board another Volaris staff demanded me to pay for my luggage again! When I try to explained that I had pay in Mexico for my luggage he stated that if I would not pay I would not be allow into the plane. He would not hear my arguments at all and would not let me talk and instead he continued threatening me with not allowing me into the plane. Also he decided to send me to the security inspection which is something they do randomly. He did it as a way to punish me. I had to pay again 1584.00 to allowed me in. Rude person, abusive and felt humiliated. Never again Volaris.

### "help me with my luggage documentation"
Not Verified |  I want to thank a guy that help me with my luggage documentation. I believe his name was Edgardo. I’m not too sure of his name but thanks to him I was able to take my luggage.

### "I never would have flown with them"
They tried to charge us for something that wasn't listed after we had paid. The charge was disputed on a credit card so they took us off the manifest and we didn't fly out to start. On the way back they didn't do a good job on the pre flight inspection and the plane didn't take off because it didn't have enough speed. They canceled the flight on the runway and as we got off we saw that a tire had delaminated and there had been a brake failure. The terms and conditions state that if they cancel a flight the passengers are entitled to a hotel, transportation to and from and a minimum 25% refund. They tried to screw us out of the first flight back and the entire service is over priced for what they offer on top of all the corners they cut. If I'd known this was a frontier subsidiary I never would have flown with them.

### "refund or change process is difficult"
Not Verified | Los Angeles to Cancun. I got into an argument with the customer service lady who was in charge of baggage control for losing my luggage during my flight and said that I would have to drive back to the airport to pick it up. I didn't understand why was this my responsibility to pick it up. The refund or change process is difficult. I called to change my flight and wanted to charge me $450 dollars more. No help from anyone. The guy on the phone pretty much told me that I have two choices - either lose out on the money ($357) or change the flight and pay an additional $450 for a one way ticket.

### "years of steady declines in service"
Not Verified |  After years of steady declines in service and price Volaris has finally caused me to write this bad review. I've flown with Volaris since it's inception because I have owned businesses and homes in Mexico and San Diego. The price gouging has always been creative with them but is at a new level. I can afford it and typically fly first class internationally and in the US so it's not about the cost but the total lack of value. This airlines on time record is fast falling. They treat customers about as badly as anything I've seen. Nothing is invested in organizing planing and deplaning and they seem to think we're lucky to pay them to fly their typically dirty planes. Today, for the fifth time this year, our plane was delayed. No updates are given just a delay notice. Then the bussed us to a plane- 1.5 hours late- and let all passengers run for the doors like a stampede from a theater fire. Unapologetic as always I'll return the favor by never flying with Volaris again. I flew Alaska on the way out and will now alternate between them and Viva Aerobus. Adios Volaris!

### "charged my family over 600 dollars for the luggage"
Not Verified |  Worst airline possible. They are rude and don’t care. They charged my family over 600 dollars for the luggage that they already had paid for. And not only that they charged my dads card 400$. Do not fly with them, they don’t care about anyone.

### "I will never fly Volaris again"
Not Verified |  After standing in line to check a bag for 1 and a half hours Francisco asked to weigh my carry on it was 8kgs then he said I need to weigh my small pack pack with it total was 12kgs. he said the limit is 10kgs and I have to pay 500 pesos (25.00) for the 2 extra Kgs. I fly once a month to Cabo but I will never fly Volaris again, worse than Spirit!

### "This airline is horrible"
This airline is horrible. The customer service is disrespectful and useless. I had paid for an extra suitcase and when i got to the airport i had to pay extra for the suitcase i already paid for. As i was coming back, I was at the airport checking in online and it said i owned money for the suitcase I paid twice for. Due to problems with immigration, I had to change my flight and to change it was 110 per person, the lady on the desk said we can choose from 2 dates. I choose one of the dates and paid the money to change the flight. After 30 minutes, I was told that i couldnt fly the date that was chosen because there was no space and had to wait a month to fly. Why would they say they have space then charge the money just to say they dont have the space. Now i have to wait a month to get back to New York. After, I called volaris costumer service to see if I could get anything sooner and the 2 people i spoke to were extremely disrespectful. This is my first and last time flying with them, they made my vacation a horrible experience.

### "Worst airline ever!"
Worst airline ever! I was returning home, arrived to airport three hours early. Volaris changed the gate on us less than 20 minutes before with no text, no email, and the website was no showing that under flight status. The new gate was 10 minutes walking distance away from original gate. We missed our flight, to talk to a clerk it was two hour wait because it was half the flight that this happened to. Their response was that they don’t notify other than on the airport screens which are limited and are 32 inches. How would we know that, every airline sends flights changes via text, email, or updates on the flight status via website. The staff is so rude they treat people horrible.

### "worst customer service"
Orlando to Guadalajara. Worst airline, worst customer service. They damaged my luggage and they said they are not responsible. They don’t care, they didn’t try to find a solution.

### "the absolute worst airline"
This was the absolute worst airline I have ever encountered. My son flew to El Salvador with our House Keeper to do charity work and they Lost or Stole his luggage. It never arrived at the airport. Volaris had no crew at baggage claim to assist him. We tried to do a Chat/Facebook and Email communication to get anyone to help us figure out how to help him find his luggage which had his medications and all his necessities as well as submitted a claim through the website. They had no phone numbers that led you to any individual humans. Absolutely no response to anything. My husband went to LAX to try and talk to a Volaris representative. He was there for over three hours trying to get anyone to assist him. The crew basically gave him the run around and never provided anyone to speak with. So now my 16 year old son is in El Salvador without any of his belongings. Had I knowns how awful this airline was I would for sure have paid whatever the extra cost was in flying with a reputable airline.

### "forget to do security check"
Not Verified | Guadalajara to Las Vegas. I cannot believe they had everyone board the plane, then had everyone de-board the plane, and they said it was because they did not do a security check. After security check they had us board the plane again. Crazy! How do they forget to do security check.

### "stressful time I didn’t need"
Not Verified |  The worst service ever, we passed TSA, Immigration, everything and right before boarding the girl at the front desk asked security to check on me and I didn’t even have a luggage with me, she let my daughter (minor) and husband passed but then they returned my daughter to check on her luggage as well. No using Volaris again, it was a headache and stressful time I didn’t need.

### "told sorry the flight is full"
Not Verified |  My daughter is a 7 year old unaccompanied minor. We paid for special services so that my daughter could be taken to the front gate and taken care of. Flight was at 11am. Her grandmother showed up 3 hours before the flight as told by employees. She waited in line. Volaris is extremely short staff and has a lot of inexperienced people working the line. Grandma told them she had special services and that she needed to fill out special paperwork. Not a single person knew how to help her and told her to wait in line. One hour passed by. It is now 2 hours before the flight. Grandma is still just waiting for help. She asked three times if she could have the paperwork to fill out. She was told no and to keep waiting. Then they sent her to a separate line and was told again to wait. An additional 30 minutes pass by and she tells them again if she could at least have the documents to fill out. They kept passing other people in front of her instead of helping her. Then they told her they had no one to take my daughter to the gate, and to keep waiting. Grandma asked again if she could at least have paperwork and documents to fill out and if they could at least check her in. She was told no and to keep waiting. Once there was one hour left, Grandma was told sorry the flight is full and there is no one to take her to the gate. Therefore, she missed her flight and they were unwilling to help even though grandma said she could take her. All they said is: Sorry we have no one to take care of her. To top things off, my 7 year old daughter is now stuck in Mexico, missing summer school, cheerleading practice.

### "Will never fly Volaris again"
Not Verified |  The worst company ever. I went to go and request a flight change and they told me that it would cost me $200 to do so. My whole roundtrip tickets for 2 people were $250. How does that make any sense? And this was within 24 hours of my purchase of the property. Absolutely insane. The worst company ever. Will never fly Volaris again. Could've changed my departure flight, but instead, you lost a customer for life.

### "Worst airline in history"
Not Verified |  Worst airline in history. Missed my connecting flight due to a delay (which was their fault, not due to traffic or weather), and was redirected 7 times before reaching an agent to reschedule the flight. The “best” they could offer me was a flight 18 hours later with no compensation of any kind (keep in mind I just finished the first flight, so I’m in a foreign city with no hotel reservation or anything). I suggested scheduling another connection that would take 12 hours less and they denied the request due to a “rule”, which when I asked for clarification they refused to provide any. Also, since it was an international flight and I wasn’t allowed to check in my bag until 4 hours before departure, I had to carry all my bags around with me for those 18 hours after an exhausting 6 hr flight in a random airport. Do yourself a favor and never fly Volaris if you wish to stay sane.

### "I will never fly with them again"
Never had such a poor experience time after time, worst trained agents at the desks and stations to let you into the plane. They don’t care about customers nor how much they paid to buy their flights and turn on top of that they penny pinch you for every little thing. Like asking you to pay for your carry on? Then after you pay they have a separate line for those that didn’t pay so you can still go in with carry on with out paying makes no sense. I waited in line like any normal customer for boarding, then as about to get in they said I needed that little piece of paper from immigration, it’s that they didn’t have any extras there so they told me I had to leave out of the airport, and then back through security. I told them I had my computer bag stolen a there in Mexico a few days earlier so to just let me fill it out in the plane or when I land in US. They says no, I then took off running like they said, can’t back drenched in sweat and they said I couldn’t get in because they cut off to board was 1:47 and it was 1:53. Meanwhile people were still boarding as I could see them going up the stairs into plane. Then they sent me to a different gate to get a new ticket for the following day, they charged me an additional $100+ to get a new one. I will never fly with them again.

### "Volaris refuse to refund us"
Not Verified |  Horrible company. Our flights were for our honeymoon Jun 3nd to 6th they changed them 2 days before to the 2nd (the day of our wedding) and had no flights to change. We requested to cancle the flights (we paid for insurance for that) they canceled them but the insurance and Volaris refuse to refund us and I spent 9 hours on the phone with them transferring me back and forth and both saying it's the others job to refund. So here we are a month later $810.00 unrefunded.

### "changed our flight itinerary"
Not Verified |  Cancun to Denver. They changed our flight itinerary less than a month from our trip. Not only was our arrival time pushed out TWO days, but we also had a 6 hour lay over in the middle of the night. We purchased a non stop flight five months ago on a specific day because we have jobs to return to. The only other options they had were all ten hours lay overs. So we had to cancel our flight and purchase through another airline less than a month before our trip. That's another couple hundred dollars I had to pay. I called Volaris to see if they would offer any sort of compensation. Idk airport voucher, free tour in Cancun or excursion just SOMETHING to make up the difference in what I am now having to pay due to their inconvenience. They couldn't offer anything but a refund which takes 7-10 days to process. I can't believe they don't have anything to offer to make this right. I paid them for a service for which they failed to provide. They changed the itinerary less than a month before our trip so we had to pay for more expensive flights. And they did nothing to try to make it right. They are unreliable.

### "3rd time they delay my flight"
Not Verified |  Horrible airline. This is the 3rd time they delay my flight not only for an hr but for more then 5 hrs. I cannot believe they don't do anything to make up for their mistake. I understand one time two times but already 4 times in less than a year? Definitely my last time travel through this airline. I rather pay more for my ticket then cancel all my plans and at the end have to spend more money. Not worth it.

### "she got more aggressive"
When I was about to board The plane I lost my paper paper to be In Mexico. When I ask the attendant that I had lost the paper to enter in México she was very rude and made some remarks That where sarcastic. I started talking to my brother which was with me in English And she said that she did not like us speaking In English because She did not understand what we were saying. I stated that I was not directing my self to her and she got more aggressive. When I asked for a supervisor she said there was none on duty. All the sudden one appear she decided to ignore me And said if I didn't leave she would call the marine for me. I walked over to the main counter and asked to speak to a supervisor Which she was able to help me after I told her that I would have to call the embassy And gave me a ticket for the next day To fly out.

### "rudest and most helpless stewardesses"
We booked business class thinking that it would in fact be business class, more room, etc. Boy were we wrong. The space from the bottom of the seat to the seat in front is 12 inches. My father is handicapped & it was literally painful to watch him go through the flight. My husband is 6'3" , another painful one to watch fly with Volaris. Hands down the rudest and most helpless stewardesses I have ever met in my entire life. My 3 year old got a rash from the seat which was covered in hair & potato chips. Flying is difficult & stressful enough. Do yourself a favor and don't make it any harder on yourself by booking with volaris. Book with literally anyone else especially if you need special accommodations.

### "Worst airline I ever used"
Worst airline I ever used. They ask money for printing the boarding pass. Girl at checking helpdesk was playing with her phone and got annoyed I asked her help. The flight was over 3 hours late, but no notification on the screens, and no compensation for my extra taxi costs.

### "$80 dollars each for our carryon"
We checked in a bag and paid for it($40) it had some tequila and I put cartons to protect them. We had 1 carryon each adult and at the counter they never said that we needed to check those in. At the moment of boarding they charged us $80 dollars each for our carryon. I could have put in my carryon inside the big check in suitcase and pay $40 to document the other one. Instead they made us pay $160 more at the time of boarding. They were rude and even yelled at my husband.

### "Disappointed is an understatement"
Not Verified |  Ok where to start: they canceled and rescheduled our flight with zero notice. Thankfully my mom wanted to check in the bags early and realized they had changed our flight the day of. Then they charged $110 for the first luggage and $150 for the second. The app graciously only charged $75 for the first. (Delta only charged us $40) then we get not even a complimentary water for our 5 hour flight. Everything is for sale. And when we finally landed, it took the pilot 20 minutes to drive the plane to the port. Disappointed is an understatement. We were disgusted. Oh, and we didn’t even get to sit together. They placed my 92 year-old grandma, my mom and I all in different seats.

### "The worst airline ever booked with!"
Hopeless airline! Do not use. Our flight going out was cancelled and we only found out on the morning of the flight! For our return flight, we arrived at the airport to be told they had overbooked the flight by 30 people! Yes, thirty! Therefore we’re told we could be driven to another airport 3 hours away or wait to get on a flight 2 days later. They confirmed that they had found out the day before but decided not to tell us! The worst airline ever booked with!

### "Very disappointed with this airline"
Very disappointed with this airline. We had our flight booked for Cancun to Portland from 2pm - 9pm on the 28th with a short layover in Guadalajara. To start, our first flight from Cancun was delayed 40 minutes, making us late to Guadalajara and our flight to Portland had already left before we arrived. The flight attendants did not know how to help us in the slightest, we were re-directed to several different employees all over the airport before finally being directed back to the main lobby and had to wait in line just to speak with the check in staff. When we were finally seen, the employee accused us of missing our flight and when we explained that it is was not our fault he told us the only available flight was the following day at 9:30am and that we would have to pay for an additional Covid-19 test before he could provide us with the boarding passes. I won't even get into how terrible the process was to get the test done. After, we returned to the check in desk for our boarding passes and had to wait 40 minutes before being seen again. A different employee helped us this second time and again insisted it was our fault that our flight was missed, this person barely spoke English and had to translate through text (which was fine, as long as we got through) however, he kept walking away from the desk to ask a coworker questions and obviously was having trouble getting our flight figured out. Once he was finally able to do so we were told that we would not be able to check our luggage in until the following morning, mind you this at 7pm. So in addition to having to wait 14 hours for our flight home we were not permitted into the departure area we had to wait in the airport entrance in a Burger King lobby until the following morning. We got up early to make sure we were ahead of the line and even the at 3am the Volaris check in was packed of people and it still took us an hour to get checked in. Overall very disappointed in the service of this airline and will not be recommending or using it in the future. In fact we will very likely be discouraging others from booking with this airline.

### "Everyone at Volaris has been extremely rude"
Not Verified |  On Friday 04/29 I dropped my parents off at CBX for their trip to finally see their parents after this awful pandemic. Per CBX they recommend arriving 2-3 hours prior to your flight. So, they arrived more than 2 hours before their flight at 12:55 AM. They checked their baggage, went through security and everything was running smooth until arriving to the gate on time. At their gate they were told they missed their flight. Mind you this is not just two passengers; 40 passengers did not make it onto this flight. Every single Volaris employee had a different excuse as to what the issue was and answered very entitled and rude to any questions. Volaris attempted to rapidly re-book people onto other flights to anu city in Mexico, (because this was a Volaris issue) however, their offer was to Leave Sunday night and return Monday morning…. (literally just land and get on the flight back). Obviously, that was not an option so this morning we are attempting to at least get credit for another flight If not a refund. We spoke to Jasmine who passed us onto her supervisor  who hung up on us. We have not been hostile or rude to anyone and as VIP members of Volaris I cannot believe this is happening. Everyone at Volaris has been extremely rude. To top it off after being told they could not board the plane and had to return home, CBX would not allow them to return without paying for a new crossing ticket, which was already pre-paid on the returning flight but did not count as a valid ticket. I need an explanation.

### "the worst airport customer service"
Volaris has the worst airport customer service I have ever experienced. Our family had to wait one hour and a half in line just to check our bags (we were in the customer with special needs because we had a baby and we were unable to print our boarding passes at the kiosk). I understand the special needs line can take longer for obvious reasons; however, they only had two counters helping customers and at some points they only had one (because the personnel was in and out). It seems like Volaris staff don't care about the time people stand in line; they seem apathetic, and also understaffed. Once we got to the counter, the lady was helpful, but at first I thought she might send us back to the end of the line because we didn't have our boarding passes. Luckily that didn't happen because I told her we already had been in line for an hour and a half and we were going to miss our flight if we did that. Once we got passed the check-in counter and onto security, that was another ordeal. The person checking the boarding passes said the stroller had to go through a different line. It was so confusing and frustrating because then another lady told us only one person can go through the stroller line and that the rest of the family had to go through the regular line. I didn't know what to do, and then the lady said "or you can all try going through the same line but you will be sent back". She was completely rude when she said that. We decided to take the risk of being sent back, and then we saw an entire family walk past us with a stroller and a baby and they were not sent back! Once we go passed security everything was fine. Additionally, I don't like how Volaris charges for everything, even for carry-on bags when other airlines don't do that. The checked-in bags were $80/each which is way too high compared to other airlines that charge $45-65.

### "we still didn't get non-stop flights"
Not Verified |  If you are a planner, in the sense that you want to know your departing date, arrival date, departure date and arrival date, do not fly Volaris. I originally had my ideal flights of nonstop departures and arrivals and they arbitrarily changed both of them on me. There is very limited communication you have to do with them, WhatsApp chat or a Facebook chat. If you use the whatssap or Facebook chat know it will take you at least 2 days to get what you need. They respond every 4 hours to your messages so be sure to put all the info into your messages every time you respond. I got a message in Spanish after 4 hours and it took me another 4 to get an English person on Chat. It will take you a day to resolve their arbitrary flight change they  imposed on you. We only  booked this way because of the the non-stop flights, but after all said and done, we still didn't get non-stop flights. They do not issue refunds or any sort of reasonable compensation and zero recourse since they are not USA compliant.

### "I was left stranded at the airport"
Flight was changed from boarding gate at supposedly 7:30 pm according to desk clerk, I was checked in at 8:02 and they provided me with the incorrect gate. Missed the flight they did not want to put me on the next plane without charging me a supposed penalty fee. Once I got back to the desk to pay the penalty fee and get the next flight they now they said I had only 30 minutes to do so and wanted to charge me the full amount of another ticket. Not only that then I asked for them to cancel my flight back and they said they couldn't that service was only online. Went online and it said i couldn't because the date had already passed today is 4/13 the flight was 4/17. After not bein able to I tried to change the ticket and now they wanted to charge me a full ticket once more. These people are horrible. I was left stranded at the airport at 1:30 am with no option and no money. Will never ever fly this airline in my life and will recommend for others to no do so either.

### "this is how our system works"
Not Verified |  My friends bought flights to come visit me. Volaris boasts of having cheaper flights but you have to pay for your seat and either have to pay for an upgraded ticket if you want baggage OR pay for your carrying on and checked baggage. If you have to cancel your flight (due to COVID for instance, which is what happened to my friends), they only give you vouchers for the flight costs (not seat, not baggage, not taxes, so you lose all that money). If you bought a round trip, they split the money you paid into one voucher for your flight to the location and one voucher for your flight back from the location so that they are equal amounts. When you go to buy your new flights (that you have to purchase within 90 days), you have to buy the flight there separately from the flight back. This means that if your flight there is more expensive than your voucher, you have to pay the difference (so my friends have to pay over 100$ extra each for a family of three for their flight to Mexico). If your flight back is cheaper than your voucher, you lose all of that money (which for my friends is more than 100$). So they are losing over $300 more in addition to their seat and baggage and having to pay over $300 dollars more! When you call to talk to the people they basically say "this is how our system works. When you ask for a higher up they take your number.

### "told me the flight was oversold"
Worst travel ever, I did the check in and they told me the flight was oversold, they didn’t have any another solution and they couldn’t pay even the hotel. After to talk with everyone they gave me a ticket for stand by and they could get me in. I don't recommend this airline.

### "Horrible experience"
Delays are normal for this airline, so you would think that they know how to handle such delays, but they don't. 9 out of 11 of their flights were delayed at Mexico city. Only one person was handling a crowd of anxious people looking for information about their flights. Horrible experience. I also had to spend the whole night trying to sleep on the floor because of a delay in Monterrey.

### "I found a great deal on Volaris"
Not Verified |  I found a great deal on Volaris to take the family (6 tickets - 2 adults AND 4 kids ages 10, 9, 8 and 4) from Tijuana to Acapulco. Both legs initially had a stop in Mexico City. Outbound flights were #Y4 816 TIJ-MEX and #Y4 748 MEX-ACA. Return flights were #Y4 904 ACA-MEX and #Y4 813 Mex- TIJ. I paid just under $1,000 USD for all six tickets. Tickets included 2 checked bags, and on the longer flights (TIJ-MEX and MEX-TIJ) the first row (premium) for more leg room.

### "customer service was horrible"
Volaris is by far the worst airline that I have ever flown. Not were the flights just delayed but they boarded us then had to take us off for maintenance and didn't help us change our connecting flights. Just said not to worry they will handle them when you get to Mexico city. Needless to say after trying to run and catch my gate which I could've made they said I couldn't board because I needed to go get my bag. Ended up missing the connection and the next available flight wasn't till the next morning. Their customer service was horrible. They are completely disorganized, rude and not helpful at all and had zero compensation for all of the people. Nothing from food, to hotel rooms, to transportation, credits, or refunds. The airplane also had no air conditioning, food, water, or anything. Not only did they waste my money and time but didn't even help resolve the issues at hand.

### "Customer service is horrible!"
Worst experience ever! Sat night flight was canceled after being delayed for over an hour, did not get another flight back home til the Sunday 9pm! Customer service is horrible! They did not provide a hotel and only some passengers were given food vouchers. $9 p/per. worst customer service! Airline doesn’t care for their passengers! Having to wait for the 24 hrs for the “next” available flight is insane. Many of families with kids including myself so it was such a horrible experience.

### "The most horrible experience I’ve ever had with an airline"
The most horrible experience I’ve ever had with an airline. Flight was overbooked, app would not allow me to access boarding pass. At least 8 people lost their seats they had already paid for. All I got as an apology was a lousy food voucher for less than $10. I very profoundly dislike this airline, and will never fly Volaris again.

### "Worst airline option in Mexico"
Worst airline option in Mexico! Flight are usually delayed and customer service is really poor. They make you pay for carry on luggage and then force you to checked bags.

### "Avoid this airline at all costs"
Avoid this airline at all costs. They emailed me a new boarding pass advising that my flight time had changed. When I got to the airport the flight had left at the original time and they made us wait so long that we even missed the second one. Eventually we had to be put on a flight 3 hours later than our original departure, without even an apology.

### "Standard low-cost carrier experience"
They rescheduled the flight to depart 5 hours earlier than I'd initially booked and didn't even notify me. Only when checking in online the day before, did I notice it had changed. Communication seems to be a recurring issue with Volaris, when I've had flights delayed 2-3 hours in the past, even though it shows the delay on their website and in the Volaris app, they don't send any email/SMS/push notification about it. Their customer service via WhatsApp takes hours to respond. That being said, the bag drop process at MEX was surprisingly quick and efficient. The cabin crew were nice, the flight departed on time. Seats were okay, no recline and not much leg room. Snacks on board for purchase. Standard low-cost carrier experience, in my opinion.

### "charge for check bags on international flights"
It is ridiculous to charge for check bags on international flights, plus they charge you for bags you already pay for. Nothing good to say about this airline, except they have direct flights. Not worth it.

### "The people were incredibly rude"
I found out when I went to get my boarding pass they overbooked the flight and I no longer could get anything until 2 days later. The people were incredibly rude and the supervisor literally left and started helping people for 40 min when he was supposed to be doing something for us. Compensations I was offered was $8 for food, $100 credit (no way I’m using them again). I called later and was hung up by customer service twice. I think that sums up the absolute embarrassment of a company this is and they should be ashamed of the people they hire. The 2 supervisors I talked to were the worst of them all.

### "turned away because we were late"
Leaving from Chicago O’Hare was not a problem. The problem was when he landed in Mexico City we lost a lot of time waiting on our luggage and then had to open all of baggage with security. Then had to run across to check in our baggage for our connecting flight only to get turned away because we were late and Volaris didn’t want to do anything for us. Never want to use Volaris again, doesn’t want to help it’s customers at all and would not give me a refund or at least a credit.

### "horrible customer service"
In 20 years I’ve never had an issue with any other airline. Horrible experience, horrible customer service. Will never use again. Don’t waste your money on it.

### "not worth the cheaper ticket"
Mexico City to Houston. Never use this airline. Cheap flight cost means no service. The information given at the airport is never correct. The website on the phone should update with gate information and it does not. The people at the counters have no idea what they are doing or any regard for foreign travelers. We spent the time between our connecting flights running back and forth between gates. When we asked about the correct gate, the staff responded irritated that we were asking. Definitely not worth the cheaper ticket price for the hassle we experienced.

### "they have charge an extra baggage"
Terrible experience, they have charge an extra baggage saying that our baggage is 14kgs which a lie because we had check our baggage before arrive to the airport and it was only 8.9kgs. Very bad experience. Also if we refuse to pay the amount of the "extra baggage " they didn't want to let us get in the airplane. After we paid we got to a very dirty and very smelly airplane.

### "Better pay a bit more and to have quality!"
It was such a terrible experience! My flight has been overbooked and they cancelled it, without any care for the accommodation. I had to pay for 2 accommodations myself (extra night in the departure city and the one which has been already booked in the final destination). They change my flight to the day after and this flight was delayed. To be honest the stress, the anger, the money and time lost was one of the worst flight experience I have ever had! It was my first and last time flying with this company. Better pay a bit more and to have quality! I definitely do not 10000% recommend this company.

### "overbooked and sold my seat"
Not Verified |  I bought a ticket 24 hours before traveling with assigned seats. I go to the airport and found out they overbooked and sold my seat. Their comment: "You should have checked in 48 hours in anticipation". What solution they gave me: A flight 3 hours later to a little town 5 hours driving to my final destiny. Oh and because they are nice, they were willing to give me $75 bucks for my flight that caused approx. $230. They lied to me. The Agent told me they processed a refund. I called hours later and no refund . And i couldn't process the refund being on the line. I have to fill out a form because that's the way they handle things. Please, make yourself a favor and don't travel with this airline.

### "Not once on either journey did Volaris apologise for the delays"
Not Verified |  I took a return flight from Huatulco to Mexico City and back. On the way the flight was an hour late. Volaris were still claiming it was on time 40 minutes after our departure time and the inbound flight hadn’t arrived. Once we landed in CDMX it took more than 30 mins to get off the plane (I was in row 33). The return flight should have left at 15.38. At 5pm they were still saying it was leaving at 4.30pm. From the first passenger boarding to closing the doors was over 40 mins. When we arrived in Huatulco one a a half hours late it took more than 30 mins to disembark again. Not once on either journey did Volaris apologise for the delays.

### "worst experience with Volaris"
Not Verified |  I have had the worst experience with Volaris. If you are ok with not having any customer service then book your flight. It has been a challenge since having to reschedule our flight to Cabo because we got COVID in December. They gave us a "credit" but it only covers the base flight. I have tried to reschedule and everytime I click to pay the remaining balance, an error pops up. There are now only 6 seats left and I have been trying for the last 2 hours. Don't fall for the low fares, it will cost you lost of time and frustration that is not worth it. I now wish I would have paid the extra $200 and gone with a reputable company.

### "Never again will I fly with Volaris"
Never again will I fly with Volaris. Trust me, spend the extra cash to get a genuine, on time flight. Not only do you have to pay for extra, which includes bags, seats and much more. But the hassle of flying with them is not worth it. The crew is ok, a mediocre job for a mediocre airline. My flight was just under two hours late of the boarding time but that was enough to make me write a review. I have never felt more disappointed in an airline than Volaris. The plane arrive late but within 15 minutes we were already boarding. Which is good, only if you like sitting in nasty, chip crumbs filled seats that aren’t even properly sanitized. I guess that’s why COVID was such a problem in Mexico.

### "no internet connection the whole trip"
I was a solo traveler 2 luggage I was charged $ 74.00 for the one I carried. We fly with no internet connection the whole trip. Second stop Guatemala we get off off the plane with no clue where to go for custom search. Finally after luggage inspection they into 3 different lines I was chosen to be search in a close room and questioned. I am a67 years old male with a 43 years USA residency never have any single issues with authorities, finally they let me go same thing happened with several other passengers.

### "avoid this terrible airline"
Not Verified |  They are not ready to fly internationally. Please avoid this terrible airline. No real professionalism in its staff and not even water is offered during the flight. The seats, are most uncomfortable. I will not recommend this airline to anybody.

### "Will never fly with them again"
Not Verified |  Horrible airline with zero live customer service. You are better off paying a couple dollars more with any other airline. I purchased two tickets for my cousin and husband as their wedding gift, they overbooked the flight and said that it was a bank issued. I called the bank and they said that there was no issue on their end and that the transaction had been approved. Volaris WhatsApp “customer service” refused to admit that they had done wrong on their part and simply said that it was the bank which was false. Will never fly with them again.

### "a disgrace of an airline"
Not Verified |  This is a disgrace of an airline, besides some of the tightest legroom, they over book and randomly drop passengers. Check in is ridiculously chaotic, we booked seats a month ahead of time, only one seat was available when we arrived and one of us was put on standby. Strangely one of the 2 seats was still assigned to us. I have flown it multiple times and will never do so again. VivaAerobus or Interjet are much better options.

### "worst and horrible airline"
This is the worst and horrible airline. They delayed our plane for two hours in the beginning and now they are saying it’s gonna be five hours. Customer service has a bad attitude  specially the supervisor. It’s not just professional and ethical,

### "complaint related to your horrible service"
I want to express a complaint related to your horrible service. Upon arrival at the Cancun airport on Tuesday November 30, 2021. By giving Frontier Airline agents our reservation they notify us that we could not travel to Chicago since they could not find our reservation. Frontier Airline agent advises us to contact Volaris to notify them that the reservation was incorrect. Had to call Volaris right in the spot. After about 10 minutes, talking to the Volaris agent, he informs us we cannot travel from Cancun to Chicago that we needed to go MXDF and leave MXCD at night arriving to Chicago at midnight. We absolutely did not accept. The Frontier agent asks me to speak to the young man from Volaris to explain that there were 17 seats available that he only need the confirmation number from Volaris. The young man from Volaris insisted that he cannot give us the confirmation number since we must travel to MXDF and from there to Chicago. After pleading with the young man from Volaris, he did not help us and hung up the phone on us. After more than an hour of insisting / desperation agony about what to do, we had no choice but to buy the most expensive tickets for three adults.

### "Avoid Volaris at all costs"
What an obsolete website and airline. Paid for all the extra luggage, seating, priority boarding and all the horns and whistles to make a hassle free flight to Miami. Finding out it had me arriving and departing Miami on the same plane that takes me there. I originally wanted to Depart MEX January 28th to Miami and return to MEX on the 7th February. It had both flights scheduled for February 7th. I had to make the departure change when I got there. To make the change was charged 3368 Peso's, USD $162.43 per my visa card charge. Fine, I expected that. But when to check in at the counter is when all the craziness started. - they charged me 5368 Peso's = $258.54 Dollars to check 2 Bags! 1 each for the 2 of us flying which was suppose to be included in the premium services I paid for. The staff at the counter didn't even know how to charge my charge cards on 3 attempts saying they were rejected. Had to do a currency exchange and pay cash or not check luggage. As we were flying to Miami to catch a cruise ship we had no choice and had to be on the early flight or miss the ship. After all this nightmare, I called my bank and wanted to know why my charges were rejected. They told me no charges of such were ever attempted on my card. Why their website would allow such a booking on the same plane is redundant and not at all user friendly as it shifts back and fourth when you are trying make your booking. Avoid Volaris at all costs. There's nothing economical about them.

### "Worst airline ever"
Worst airline ever, their service is really poor. Lack of information their system is obsolete, their crew is not educated. I have to pay $115 to get the boarding pass. They don’t offer a cookie and they don’t know how to handle an airline.

### "customer service is basically non-existent"
Volaris initially sold me on their flights due to their promise of "lower" prices. I even paid to upgrade my seats to the front of the plane and was excited to get a decent deal during a holiday. Upon my initial check in at the airport, the problems began. Volaris told me I had two sets of tickets, which I was unaware of (as I only received one email with one receipt!) I told them I only wanted one flight and the assistant said she would take care of it. She apparently did and we boarded the plane and vacationed. Upon our attempt to return, we were told there was no flight for us, as our tickets had been cancelled! Upon further review, it was found by a Volaris agent, that the prior assistant had cancelled the flight I had the paperwork on, and had left the other flight open. The issue is, the return flight was on different date that was a week prior to our scheduled return date, and which we knew nothing about! The agents in Guadalajara would not budge and since we have responsibilities, we had to get home and had to buy a subsequent return ticket. The agent assured us that the other ticket for a "missed flight" would be refunded by contacting customer service after we returned. Volaris customer service is basically non-existent and not of service. You can never get a live person on a phone line, unless you're buying a ticket. I used the email link, to which Volaris states will be responded to "within 2 days" - I've written three emails, each a week apart--and I have had no response! I sent a Messenger message and have gotten no response except an animated, antiquated number system sending me in a loop. I finally got a horrible response on Whatsapp that told me it was too late to request a refund, since I had "accepted" the initial flight and had "missed" the return flight. I should state here, that the return flight we repaid for, was not full, either! So here I sit with Volaris claiming there's nothing they can do---for their mistakes, which as cost me twice what I was originally paying! Thus, my flight has ended up costing me far more than any other airline would've in the first place. It's a scam! Volaris doesn't have low fares. They're there to cheat you out of your money and your flights. We were not the only ones this had happened to on our days of travel and several people's planes had left them as they decided to take off "early" without warning.

### "I loved this flight"
I loved this flight. This is my second time flying Volaris. The attendants are efficient & informative in English & Spanish. The aircraft were clean. Snacks & drinks you have to buy them if you want them. Hand sanitizer is offered throughout the flight. It does not have all the USA frills, but who needs them. Volaris knows how to keep flight costs down & customers happy.

### "Never got to the plane"
Never got to the plane, arrive at the airport 1:45 minutes before departure and there was no one at the front desk to help me. I know I was right on time but if there was some one actually at the front desk I could have made my flight. Hard to get hold of them on the phone. Poor customer services.

### "Horrible customer service"
Horrible customer service. They changed my flight and when I called them to get the same flight. They said they could not get my flight back, so I requested my refund and they also said they cannot give me a refund. They will never get my business again. Do not buy from them, they just like to take your money and don’t care about the customers.

### "airline is the worst I have come across"
This airline is the worst I have come across in more than 30 years of buying flights around the world. I will never fly with this airline again after they rescheduled our flight by 3 hours, without informing us, making it impossible to connect with our flight home to the UK and refused to put us on any earlier flights unless we paid them more than double the price of our original return ticket. Despite their website and terms and conditions clearly stating that they will inform passengers of any schedule changes and rebook those affected, we only found out that they had delayed our return flight to Cancun by 3 hours when I tried to do online check-in for the flight. When we called them to ask why they had not warned us of the change they were totally unapologetic, saying that because the delay was less than 4 hours they had no obligation to tell us about a change that they said they had made two weeks earlier. They didn't care that it meant we would miss our flight home to the UK (the 4.25 hour connection time I had built into the journey was reduced to 75 mins in an airport that recommends minimum 120 mins) and refused to put us on any of their many earlier flights that day unless we paid them nearly 23,000 pesos (around $1000 USD), compared to 10,300 pesos that we had paid for the whole return ticket and 10,500 pesos that another airline was charging for a suitable flight that day. We were left with no choice but to buy new flights with that other airline and made our connecting flight home. Buyers and flyers beware!

### "This airline provides no customer service"
Not Verified |  This is the second time we’ve flown with Volaris. The first time our flight got canceled and we didn’t get to go home for 3 days. The second time, they charged me 130 dollars for a checked bag even tho the app and the website states a checked bag is 54 dollars. The airport man took advantage of seeing that we were American and took his time trying to find something wrong with our documents and later just changed us extra for one bag just because. He did not provide an explanation. This airline provides no customer service, they are truly not worth it!

### "Worst Airline Experience"
Worst Airline Experience. Show up 3 hrs early ticket says to show up 2 (11am) volaris and only volaris has over an hour wait for check-in (1pm) checkin girl says were running late but can still make it (flight at 2pm) we rush across cross border express. Don't make it,have to get in another line that easily take another hour, just to be told there are no more flights left and that I'm not eligible for a refund since the rep checked me in go talk to supervisor. Rep then tells me he cant reschedule the return flight because the system wont allow him to. For that I need to call their center after an fruitless argument I leave believing him (wish I hadn't)  so me and my fiancée then have to get a taxi to the border CBX regardless of the situation doesn't let you back across. We get in the pedestrian line with all our luggage take 1.5 hrs once across we have to got back to CBX for our car get home around 10pm. Next day call the center only to be told that the volaris rep was supposed to change the return flight at the airport. I then get on with his supervisor who then says they cant make changes and that in order to reschedule my return flight we have to pay $100 per person and what ever the difference is (we booked in advance so the difference would be significant) says I have to go back to Tijuana in person or my other option is forfeiting the money for the ticket and just buying a fresh ticket. Never flying Volaris again.

### "the last time I fly Volaris"
Not Verified |  Last 3 flights in the past 2 years have been all delayed arriving and departing. Always poor excuses. The first time they sent a voucher, but surprise it was already expired when they sent it. Ridiculous. Sitting here waiting for my domestic flight and arrived 2 hours early to find out about another delay. I asked if I could be put on the early flight arriving to my destination that is not delayed and hadn't started boarding and they did nothing to help. Regardless of telling them and showing them the email about my arriving flight being delayed 4.5 hours. They didn't even attempt to help give me one seat on a flight that was not full. This is the last time I fly Volaris.

### "not get the advertised extra space"
Not Verified |  Premium seat scam. Aside from the front row and exit rows, you will not get the advertised extra space. Literally the same thing as regular seating. Do not waste your money, better yet, fly with another airline. Customer service is non-existing at the airports and over the phone.

### "horrible hygiene wise"
Flights delayed by 3 hours. Ridiculous queues to get information at airport. Aviation crew don’t even greet when you board. Had 2 connecting flights which were filthy, horrible hygiene wise. Especially during COVID you’d think they would take extra precautions. They don’t offer any drinks or food during flight, not even water.

### "lack basic respect for their customers!"
Why are Volaris employees so rude? They lack basic respect for their customers! This lady returning from cabin with a wheelchair had an argument with a customer waiting in line to seat and called him dumb as she walked away! And let me say that this customer never said a bad word to this lady! It’s fair to said that the ladies in the cabin (flight attendants) were very nice and respectful!

### "their customer service is trash"
Volaris and their customer service is trash. I will never travel with then again. I'd rather pay the extra 200 per ticket then have to deal with their horrible customer service ever again.

### "the worst service I have experienced at the airport"
Not Verified |  The worst experience, I traveled from CDMX on Monday and the flight was delayed 3 hours, then, on Wednesday I was lined up to check in an extra luggage for 2 hours. When I made it to weigh the suitcase they told me I was unable to do it because the flight was boarding since 3 minutes ago. So I lost the flight. There were 6 windows to check in and only 3 people actually doing it, its the worst service I have experienced at the airport.

### "the worst airline experience"
This was the worst airline experience I ever had. Very bad customer service on land and inside aircraft. They charge for everything. Including water which is free in other airlines. Charge to much for luggage compare to other airlines. You end up paying more than other airlines even if you got your flight at a low price. Flight attendants ignore you if you need assistance. I will not travel with this airline again. I do not recommend it to anyone.

### "the lady refused to help us"
Not Verified |  The airline canceled our flight from MEX to Sacramento International Airport and blamed it on SMF being closed due to dense fog. We found out later on that SMF was never closed. The unethical behavior occurred at MEX afterwards when we were told that the next available flight isn't till the next day in the afternoon and the fact that they will not be providing any sort of assistance with hotel and food expenses during the delay of almost 24 hours. It gets worse, once we received our new flight I asked one of the employees to help my wife and I find a hotel to stay at as we are not familiar with Mexico and don't speak the language (we were at MEX because we had a connecting flight to SMF) and the lady refused to help us. All she said is "you have a phone right? and you have google right? so figure it out. This was outrageous because even though we had cell phones and service, we didn't speak the language and didn't feel comfortable stepping out of the airport as were told that it isn't safe especially at 12 midnight. Thankfully we found out from another passenger that the airport has a Hilton Hotel in the airport and we just ended up staying there till the next morning and ate the cost.

### "this is by far the worst airline"
I fly multiple times a year and have flown with dozens of international carriers and this is by far the worst airline. Leaving Guadalajara we missed our flight after standing in the bag drop line for 2.5hrs (we were already checked in), we had to rebook a one way flight, paying again for the luggage, for a taxi and accommodation, dining, etc - costs us an extra $1000USD. The following night we board fairly painlessly, but my luggage does not arrive. Filed an incident report at the airport, the number provided on the form rings out (I've dialed it at least 50x). The number on Volaris "lost luggage" site is defunct. Its been almost 5 days and I'm finally offered $50 credit to be used in 30 days - what a joke! Doesn't even cover the cost of adding checked baggage!

### "worst flight I have ever experienced"
Not Verified |  This has been the worst flight I have ever experienced in my life. It is my understanding that passengers should always be treated fairly and most of all be secured seats when flights were booked a week prior to departing date. Unfortunately, our grandma passed away and it was 24 family members including myself who were going from Guadalajara to Mexicali, in which again, our flights had already been booked a week prior. However, the employees up at the front, said we only have 5 seats left. How does this overbooking even take place during COVID? The service we were given was extremely unprofessional and all of the employees disregarded that we had already booked our flights. We were told to wait until next day for a flight. The service on the plane was also ridiculous. All of the flight attendants rushed us when we asked for food saying “hurry up the plane is about to land”. As a frequent traveler, I know that flight attendants should not be serving food moments before landing. This was insane; we were starving and we had also waited on Thai plane for over an hour. It was supposed to depart at 5:45 am and we left at around 6:30 am. We were not communicated what was going on but this was such a messy situation that caused even more stress on us. We were also given “vouchers” for food since we were forced to stay another day. Per policy, in causes of an overbooking  Volaris must accommodate free transportation, food, hotel, etc. in this case, Volaris did not accommodate for us. The vouchers did not cover even half of what the food costs were. We tried to explain this to the supervisor and she insisted they could not make an exception even after them denying us seats to the flight we fully paid for and secured days before. They caused again another inconvenience for us and disregarded the fact that we had 3 kids with us that needed extra care. All of the employees were extremely rude and if it wasn’t for me reading this policy on their website, they would NOT have offered to make these “accommodations” for us as they were ready to get us out of the line so we wouldn’t be in the way of others. This airline has been by far, the worst experience our family members have ever dealt with. They are inconsiderate, rude, unfair and truly miserable with their job. As a Mexican American, I am truly embarrassed that our country has such a terrible airline. If I could rate this a negative 10 I definitely would. Please if you are considering in flying with them, don’t. Pay a little extra and I promise your experience with any other flight will be better.

### "waiting four hours total at the airport"
To say I was discouraged would be an understatement. The airline was late four hours, we were not notified with an email or anything when arriving two hours before departure. So we ended up waiting four hours total at the airport arriving to our destination very late at night. This not only messed up our plans for the day but had us worried whether we would make it safely.

### "changed flight without my consent"
Booked tickets for my parents as a birthday gift for my mother for October 26th, paid $800 and they changed my flight for October 25th without my consent. I tried doing the check in Friday night and was not able to and noticed it said the flight was for the 25th Oct. I called seeing what had happened and they kept giving me the run around and saying they could not do anything for me. Nor refund my money nor give me my original booking date.

### "ground staff were extremely unfriendly and unhelpful"
Not Verified |  I have travelled extensively and by far had the worst experience with the Volaris ground staff at the boarding gate at Guatemala City. My wife and I were pulled out of the boarding line on the premise of checking our passports and covid documents. When everyone had boarded the flight we were then informed that we had to pay for our hand luggage. When I explained that I had already paid extra at the time of the booking and showed them the evidence they insisted that unless we paid an additional $118 USD we would not be allowed to board the plane. As we had a long haul connection the same day I reluctantly made the payment. The ground staff were extremely unfriendly and unhelpful and I will never use this airline again. I am making this review as a clear warning to others who may be considering flying with Volaris.

### "Terrible airline in all the ways"
Don't waste your time or money. The continued struggle for Volaris to have good customer service is real. You may be saving money compared to other airlines but they will switch and cancel your flights. Not offer you a refund, at best is a credit. This is the 2nd time I've had issues and many other times my friends and family have had the same issues. Terrible airline in all the ways.

### "The personnel are not friendly"
Not Verified |  The personnel are not friendly, they don't offer even a glass of water without payment so forget about the peanuts. The aircrafts need maintenance, when you take off the seat back support moves like you are reclining, some seats are already reclined so you can do nothing and they want you to move it to a vertical position. Others like mine you need to manually bring it back to a vertical position because the bottom is broken. While some airlines charge $30 dollars for the first checked in bag, they charge $49.61 and service of the ticketing agents is not nice or polite. I will not recommend flying through this airline at all.

### "they have no regard for time"
I guess you really do get what you pay for! They are disorganized, long check in wait times, they have no regard for time, they are delayed without giving explanation and are often rude rather than apologetic!

### "do not give an explanation of the delay"
In this airline the delay of two hours is standard, they do not give an explanation of the delay, that is if they notify a few minutes before going to the airport that the flight is delayed, without indicating for how long. Let's not talk about their prices to check suitcases ... the tickets are not even cheap. En esta aerolínea el retraso de dos horas es estándar, no dan explicación del retraso, eso si avisan unos minutos antes de ir al aeropuerto que el vuelo está retrasado, sin indicar por cuánto tiempo. No hablemos de sus precios para facturar maletas… los billetes no son ni económicos.

### "totally damaged my New luggage"
Just had the last straw with this airline. In my last trip, they totally damaged my New luggage piece and refused to reimburse me for it. You judge what they determined to be a minor dame of regular luggage handling.

### "Volaris is beyond incompetent"
I recently booked a flight with three friends on Volaris from Tijuana to Loreto, Mexico for a fishing trip. Volaris recommended that we arrive 2 hours early. We arrived 3 hours early. We had bags to check and after going through security and immigration we still had an hour and a half before we flew. We got in line to check our bags. Volaris had very few people checking bags. The ones that were working were moving extremely slowly with no regard for people missing their flight. As the line progressed very slowly we became concerned that we were going to miss our flight. I voiced my concerns in Spanish to the girl working for Volaris twice and she just said to be patient as she allowed several passengers to go in front of us. Finally when we were allowed to go to the check in, the attendant said the baggage check was closed for our flight and we would have to carry on our luggage/fishing gear. We went to check in our carryon luggage and the Volaris security girl opened our bags and started removing items that she said couldn’t be carried on. She called over another employee and removed the following items from my carryon bag, fishing lures, all hooks, all sinkers, pliers and all three of my expensive fishing reels. She allowed a very sharp fillet knife to stay in the bag with no problem. She put these items in a tray and was going to keep them. By this time our gate was closed and we were going to miss our flight. I grabbed my stuff for her and out it back in my bag. We ended up getting a taxi in Mexico, bringing all of our luggage back through US customs and over the border and taking another taxi to the parking lot. I ended up driving the 700 miles into Mexico to Loreto as a result of their complete and utter disregard for their passenger’s welfare. Volaris is beyond incompetent. We spoke to other fishermen in Loreto that had the same experience with Volaris. They had very expensive fishing tackle seized and confiscated by Volaris employees or missed their flights like us. Every fisherman that we spoke to about Volaris said they would never fly with them again. One couple said they saw a wedding party leaving Tijuana who had all missed their flight and the wedding because of Volaris horrible service. After arriving in Loreto I tried to cancel my return flight for credit. They wouldn’t’ even give credit for the canceled flight. I’ve been on hundreds of flights with numerous airlines having traveled to 42 countries. I’m a very experienced traveler and Volaris is the worst airline I’ve ever flown on.

### "the worst customer service that I've ever dealt with"
Not Verified |  Volaris is by far the worst customer service that I've ever dealt with and complete scammers. 1) They claim a change was made for something that was never paid for, but somehow claim it went through. 2) Never received confirmation of the said change, but was expected to somehow know that a change occurred, yet I didn't pay for it. 3) Once I asked, look it's simple honor our reservation it can all be solved, both to the customer service rep and his supervisors, both were very rude. After giving them plenty of time to speak they still kept being completely disrespectful. I warn you do not fly this airline

### "a complete waste of time for us and them"
This airline is cheap, but that is the last thing good you can say about it. I fly with them frequently, but will not again. My wife and I were to fly from TJ to Loreto, only because there are not may airlines that do. Our anniversary trip. The night before, our teenage son who was to stay home, had a brain injury and needed 48 hour supervision. Not life threatening or anything, but we could not go on our anniversary as to watch him. Called Volaris, and of course they said we "can't" do anything. I used to book 30-40 flights a year with them for business and travel. I spent 2 hours on the phone with them only to hear that the people on the line have no power to do anything. So a complete waste of time for us and them. I cannot believe this business will be around for long. I don't care how cheap they are. What a joke.

### "never fly with Volaris again"
Not Verified |  I made a mistake of booking a package with Expedia that include Volaris. After we booked, I finally went and read up on Volaris. I instantly regret booking the trip. Our flight from Houston to Cancun was smooth. So i though okay maybe the review is not that accurate. Boy, did thing change when we fly back. Our flight was at 11:00s from Cancun to Mexico city, then we have an connected flight from there back to Houston. We got to the airport around 9am. Then they announce their flight will be delay. then more announce of more delay. We ask them, with the delay can we still make our connected flight. They like Oh, you are flying to Houston? We were like yes we are. The rep, said come with me! We were like what is going on. She then said you will miss your connected flight (in my mind, so you know about us missing out flight but never call for us?). She offer us to rebook our flight, we will yes please. After 30 minutes or so she told us, she can get us back to Houston, but we have to stay in Mexico City over night at the airport. We were like no way we are staying at the airport overnight with Covid. We then search ourself and found Sun Airline have a flight to Houston. We ask the rep, can they book it for us. She said No. We then ask if we book it ourselves, will they Refund it for us. She said she have to ask her "Boss". After a few minutes waiting, we will directed to another stand where we meet her boss. She ask us to wait while she were doing something. Another 30 minutes pass by, we ask what is going on. Boss said just give her some more time. Another 15 minutes went by, still nothing. By now, we were like we need to book our flight with Sun before it sold out. We ask the boss later, can we just book the flight with Sun Country ourselves and they can refund us later. She said yes. She took down our itinerary and said it will be take up to 20 business day for them to refund. . Well it been a month, and never give us the refund. We lost so much that we will never fly with Volaris again.

### "Avoid them at all costs"
Not Verified |  Worst Experience Ever with an Airline. I booked a round trip flight and later (within 24 hours) realized I needed to change the time of my return flight or sit in the terminal for 10 hours. They charged me $150 to make the change even thought their stated policy, as with most airlines is "no fee for changes with 24 hours. The flight is 4 weeks away and its peak season for Cabo so their is not a chance in hell they would not sell that seat and besides, they should honor their policy. This is just the start of my nightmare. Then I try to contact them to discuss the issue. You can only talk to them via facebook messenger or WHATSAPP. I asked twice for a customer service number but the chat agent never acknowledged. I even threatened to file a claim and they still did not care. Total joke, they hide behind technology. Wish I had read the other reviews before I decided to fly with them. Avoid them at all costs.

### "worst travel experience ever"
Thank you very much for the worst travel experience ever. While all airlines do care of health and safety regulations, they are obviously not interested. Volaris is the only air company which doesn’t care who is on board. In terms of the pandemic they demonstrate total ignorance to passengers’ health and safety. Absolutely unacceptable service. Never again.

### "I was never told that it was an oversold ticket"
Not Verified |  Worst flight ever! I was flying with my child who is 13 on July 31 2021. My nightmare started when I arrived to Guadalajara airport to begin with a 40 min line just to get your luggage check in. But before arriving I had tried doing my child's boarding pass online and I got an error message to call Volaris directly. So I called while on my way to the airport and was told they couldn't help me on the phone and to go to the main airport. Once I arrived to the Airport, after a 40 min wait I finally got to the check in baggage and was told my son couldn't fly due to Volaris over selling tickets to 6 people. My son was put on a waiting list which he was number 4 on the list. We had to wait for someone to cancel in order for my son to be able to fly with me. I bought his ticket 2 weeks before and I was never told that it was an oversold ticket. I will never fly with Volaris again. Thankfully someone didn't show up and my son was able to return home with me to L.A.

### "not be flying with them again"
Not Verified |  My family was supposed to return home to Chicago on 7/25, however, 3 out of 4 of us tested positive on 7/24. We were tested onsite at the Morelia airport. We were told by the airport testing site to wait for 5 days to reschedule the flight and contact the airline. I could not speak to anyone at Volaris and was only redirected to chat via Whatsapp. I was able to get a response from someone a couple of days later offering credit for the return flight. In total I submitted two tickets and received emails from 3 different people and was eventually given credit for the return flight. I was not able to use a credit for my daughter as they mistakenly issued 2 credits under my son and none under for my daughter. No where was I told a minimum # of days I had to wait to reschedule our flight. Nor anywhere on the Volaris website does it state I had to wait a minimum # of days to fly. After purchasing new tickets to fly out for over $1500.00 USD and visiting a physician (as requested by the Volaris email agents), we were denied a flight home when we attempted to check in at the Morelia airport on 7/29. I asked to speak to a supervisor to explain our situation. I waited over 45 mins for a supervisor as he was busy elsewhere. The original clerk told me we were supposed to wait 10 days before travel. The supervisor told me I should have waited 14 days and referred me to the CDC website for instructions on flying after testing positive, which I disagree with. I believe the airline should instruct their customers. Another clerk came over and was on allegedly on the phone with someone else (she never introduced herself or told me her capacity, she literally butted in the conversation) and told me I was to wait 90 days to fly after testing positive. She clearly misinterpreted the Volaris website entirely. I will not be flying with them again!

### "worst I've ever experienced"
On what was supposed to be my return flight (Y4906 @1830) from Guadalajara Jalisco on 7/26 my husband and I realized what a horrible mistake we made in choosing your airline for our vacation! The customer service was the worst I've ever experienced in my life. Your client services and boarding agents where just plain rude and the most condescending people I've encountered. After we checked in presented our passports, had them scanned, and obtained boarding passes we where asked if we would check in my husband's 1 carry on suit case for free since there was alot of baggage on board. We didn't have any reason not to so we kindly agreed and proceeded to the security check point where we where asked for our passports and boarding passes. We quickly realized that my husband put his passport in the carry on we checked in, and we asked if we should go try to retrieve it as we had 2.5 hours before our flight time and we had just checked in. The security check point officer assured us my husband could board with his boarding pass and any identification (he had a California ID and Us Resident ID card) we where told that would be fine. We waited till they called our group to board at the gate and that's when 4 different volaris boarding agents where rude and unwilling to listen to what happened or try to accommodate us. We told them the passport was scanned when we got the boarding passes and then put away in the carry on which was documented with the paid luggage. They said we'd have to go to customer service and reschedule our flight because no one could board without a passport in hand (my husband even had a picture of his passport on his cell phone they didn't care to even look at it) . We pleaded for someone to request our luggage since we still had 1 hour before take off but they told us luggage couldn't come back to the airport until after the plane took off. We asked for a supervisor and the rude lady checking document's to board said she was the supervisor of that flight and there was no one above her. We ended up having to reschedule our flight, pay $240.00 USD for that, have new covid test done which ran us $100USD more, find a place to stay for the next 2 days because they didn't have any flight for 2 more days and my husband missed 2 days of work. In the end it was a very stressful and expensive experience leaving us with no desire to ever fly with your airline or any other Mexican airline ever! It's upsetting that your company allows this type of behavior from your employees we are your customers after all and who keep your company afloat. There where many people turned away that evening for all sorts of reasons at the boarding point. I just don't understand how one gets to the gate only to be rudely turned away.

### "a time consuming, costly, exasperating experience"
I can only strongly confirm the negative reviews here. Flying with Volaris has been a time consuming, costly, exasperating experience - easily my worst in this otherwise wonderful country.

### "Horrible service"
The airline delayed the flight by about an hour before attempting to take off. Once on the runway, they doubled back to the gate because of an issue with an injector that was going to be replaced. After an hour they told us we were going to be boarded to another plane but it took them over two additional hours to get this plane. They sent an email apologizing for a 1hr 57 min delay which was actually 4 hour delay and they offered a voucher of $100 pesos for the next flight. My seat was double booked so I had to make sure I was not taken off the plane since I had already missed the prior day flight because of so many delays of getting the COVID test which they referred on their website which took over 2 1/2 hours to complete and an additional 45 minutes for them to give your the results. There were other individuals that were also double booked and was the reason for the initial hour of delays since they could not provide their list of people that had boarded. Horrible service, only thinking of the all mighty dollar and I hope the FAA or someone gets involved in consumer protection since they are literally ripping people off.

### "This is the worst airline"
This is the worst airline I have ever have had to encounter! Definitely do not recommend. In Mexico we were trying to check in to our flight through our phones and it was not letting me and my family of 6 to do so. After many tries it finally let my older brother check in. My older brother got his boarding pass and paid for his checked bag which cost him around $55. Once we arrived to the airport we explained our situation of not being allowed to check in through our phones to the front desk people of Volaris. They made up some lame excuse saying that it had to do with a credit card having money on hold. It quickly got resolved. Next they said it costs $70 each for a checked bag since we waited to pay at the airport. We explained again about not having access to check in through our phones and they did not care. I asked if we can take carry on bags up on the plane with us and they said “yes with an extra cost.” I asked if it will be cheaper than the checked bag cost and they said “yes.” So we paid $70 for each checked bag and paid for 2 carry ons. I look at my credit card to see that they charged my card and it said $149 for 2 carry ons. In total we paid about $400 for 2 carry ons and 3 checked bags. Once we got on the flight we realized how poor quality it was. The flight attendants looked disorganized and you have to pay for everything on the plane. I was so over it, at that point I just wanted to go home.

### "Service was terrible"
Terrible service! They charged me and my brother for our luggage twice even though we had already paid for them on the app. Very slow working and lazy. They had 4 people working in the check in station but only 1 knew what they were doing. One of the girls working was complaining about her lunch instead of helping us. And then on the plane ride, the flight attendants were rude and had no idea what they were doing. They had the snack carts blocking the bathrooms. They kept telling us to sit down but we couldn't because their cart was blocking us to our seats. And then during the flight I overheard them gossiping about some of passengers. Service was terrible, never want to use this airline again.

### "don't want to give me a refund"
Not Verified |  I purchased 3 tickets from Culiacan to Cancun. Volaris change the flight time and bow they want me to pay to change it when there the ones who messed up. They don't want to give me a refund, worse service I ever had. The hotel where we are staying is picking us up for free cause we are 15 people going, now the hotel is charging me due to having to go back to the airport to pick up my parents and sister cause of Volaris changing my pare to flight time.

### "Very poorly organized airport"
Worst experience with this airline and their customer support. Please do not fly cos they are a little cheap. You end up paying more with all the carry-ons, check-in luggage, seat assignments. I had a connecting flight from Cancun to San Jose. Layover was supposed to be 1 hr 40 mins. But the flight from Cancun was delayed by an hour. Kept checking with the flight attendants on the delay and I had to catch a connecting flight. They kept saying the airline already knows about the delay and not to worry. But by the time we got out the flight there was 30 mins left to get to the other gate. The walk to the other gate was like 20 mins and the flight gate was closed and I had to reschedule my flight. Nobody even speaks English to understand I was flying with two kids and a pregnant wife. If only they coordinated and held the flight for another few mins my family would have got on. After that it took me two hours to reschedule the flight. These idiots don't understand to give me options either. They first told me the next flight was 3 days after to San Jose. They never told me I had options to select to Oakland, SFO or other nearby airports. Lucky for us we checked and got on a flight to Oakland the same day. Its minimum common sense to have at least one person who can communicate in for any airline and its minimum common sense to delay your connecting flight when your own airline is delayed at the other airport. If there is no communication whatsoever its perfectly shitty airlines to travel in. All airports in mexico are so commercial. There are no water fountains at all at the airports, but they made sure to have so many stores to make money. The gates are placed far away from each other cos they spent money to build stores in between each gate and not focusing on passenger satisfaction. Very poorly organized airport. Don't get carried away by the fancy stores. That's not what we need when we are travelling. Convenience takes priority. All announcements are made only in Spanish and they don't care there be people travelling from all around the world. You have to keep asking people for translations.

### "This is a terrible way to do business"
Not Verified |  This airline is a joke. We were unable to get on our connecting flight and the company refused to change our ticket although it was their fault for missing our flight. We had to buy entirely new one-way tickets to get home, which cost as much as my entire vacation! I've explained the situation and the company refuses to provide a refund, even partial. This is a terrible way to do business and I will never fly Volaris again. I will also make sure to explain my situation to anybody who will listen so nobody else wastes their money.

### "The service was second rate and the attendants were sloppy"
On June 15 my family and I were returning to the United States on flight Y4936, from Guadalajara Mexico. My family of three were split up throughout the plane. My son and I sat in the rear cabin in the last row on the right side facing the rear of the plane. The engines of the plane were off and it was very hot and humid. I mentioned this to the flight attendant, the only male attendant working on the flight, he became very rude and argumentative. He tried to pick a fight with me and accused me of not wanting to wear my face mask which was a total lie. The other attendants would give me dirty looks. This was one of the worst and most unprofessional flights I had ever experienced. I will never fly Volaris again. The service was second rate and the attendants were sloppy, unconcerned and derelict in their duties. When I told him I was going to complain about his unprofessionalism, he laughed and said "they don't care about you".

### "Terrible customer service"
Not Verified |  This company overall sucks. Terrible in person customer service. Ridiculous policy on checking in bags on a domestic flight. We were at the check in counter an hour plus before our domestic flight, and were told we could not check in or board our flight because we were not there over 2 hours before our flight. We then had to stand in another line and spoke with another incompetent agent who charged us $160 USD to move us to a later flight because they wouldn't check in our bags to our original flight. The agent could not give us an explanation as to why we were being charged a fee. Terrible customer service. Will never fly with this airline. Do NOT recommend.

### "I was never able to get my refund"
Not Verified |  The worst experience I have had! I was told I had to stay in line to cancel my flight and get a credit with the clerk at the airport. I spent almost an hour, the clerk told me I had to call customer service and the lady that told me to wait in line was a new employee, she didn't know what she was saying when she referred me to the clerk! I called customer service (which took me a long time because they kept prompting WhatsApp), I also spent about an hour and they could not refund my ticket because I was late one hour to put in the claim. It was over an hour when I spoke with the clerk and he wrote the notes but they didn't mean anything to the person I spoke on the phone. She said to use the website to start a claim. I was never able to get my refund. It was the first time I bought a ticket with this airline and it will sure be the last one!

### "Horrible service"
Worst experience of my life. Horrible service. Why doesn’t the owner do anything , they are now known as the worst airline by many people. They need to shut this airline down . I would rather travel by bus next time than ever take a flight with them.

### "never travel with Volaris again"
Volaris overbooked tickets, then try to blame it on the customer telling them they were late when we were ready to check in 3 hours before our flight . I tried to do the check in on my phone but it would tell me that I didn’t reserved a seat and my flight was closed. Costumer service is absolutely horrible, I was trying to get an explanation about my flight because obviously what it was happening didn’t make sense at all but all they could tell me is that it was my mistake because I didn’t reserve a seat. The only option they gave me was to take the next flight to Mexico City with connection in Tijuana. I departure from ciudad Juárez Monday 28, 2021 at 5:00 pm and I arrived in Mexico City Tuesday 29, 2021 at 7:00 am next day. Unacceptable. I had to be traveling all night, because the airline overbooked tickets. The airline make me loose a lot of money because I had to make a lot of changes to my traveling planes because Mexico City wasn’t my final destination. Overall I’ll never travel with Volaris again. Volaris is a rude disorganize that doesn’t care about their customers.

### "the last time I fly with them"
Volaris reached out to me and my travel companions that our flight had changed and we needed to approve this change. The change was supposed to be for a different time that day. Naturally, without any choice really, we approved the change. Come to find out two weeks later that the date had now changed to 3 days after our original flight which put us in a terrible place to have to book accommodations and cancel others. I called into their "customer support" team and, on my mother's grave, they recommended we change our flights back to the original flight we had booked for the small cost of $156). It is important to note I explained how ridiculous this was, and that the flight change fee was the same cost of the original flight. Let's recap, they made us change our flight to a different one, for no apparent reason. They then charged us a change fee for reverting back to our original plans, and did not offer us any discount. This will be the last time I fly with them until they get their (expletive) together.

### "worst airline I have ever used"
Volaris was the worst airline I have ever used! We had connecting flights from Cancun to Mexico City to Los Angeles. The flight from Cancun was delayed by over an hour. We repeatedly ask the flight attendant to notify our connecting flight that we were running late and to wait for us, to which she respondent that "Volaris will wait for you" and there was no reason to call. We also requested to exit the plane first but were denied. When we arrived in Mexico City we had to run to the connecting gate and arrived 15 minutes before take off. We were told we were too late and not permitted to board. There were approximately 20 other travelers that had the same connection that were not permitted to board the flight to LA. Once we located the Volaris ticket counter we were told the next flight to LA was in 24 hours. Volaris did not offer overnight accommodations nor food compensation. We had to insist on a hotel and food. We spent over an hour and a half at the counter arguing with the Volaris employees. The employees were wholly incompetent to help us and the manager was not much better. In fact, the manager left before addressing all the upset customers.

### "unprofessional and severely unorganized"
First of all, no one in this airline knows anything. They mess up and want the customers to pay, literally. For example, Volaris does not have a legitimate gate in LAX. Everything is by word of mouth because their emails and texts are are very vague. When you’re in Mexico trying to check in, if you don’t check in through your phone there will be a charge to check in at the airport. Fine I downloaded the app and was having questions to what they responded with, “we have no knowledge of the website. We can only help you if you check in.” That translated to, pay up for help. Very unprofessional and severely unorganized. Do they not know about company emails? It’s a legitimate question.

### "customer service very bad"
The customer service (phone, email, social networks) very bad, they do not answer. To my surprise, the Volaris Airline seems to be selling extra tickets, I want to decide if the capacity of the plane is 200 they sell more than that amount, and in the end they tell them that they have missed the flight because the plane closed the doors because It is at its maximum capacity. El servicio al cliente (telefono, email, redes sociales) muy pesimo, no contestan. Para mi sorpresa, la Aerolinea Volaris parese ser que vende voletos extras, quiero desir si la capasidad del avion es de 200 ellos venden mas de esa cantidad, y al final les dicen a que han perdido el vuelo porque el avion lla cerro las puertas porque esta a su maxima capasidad.

### "told us we missed out flight"
Not Verified |  Worst airline, they overbook their flights and leave customer losing their flight. I was flying on June 20 back home to Vegas. I arrived to the Guadalajara airport 4 hours before take off. Was waiting in the gate, receipt text stating the flight was delayed but in reality the plane was leaving with out me and my family and a couple more passengers. When the aircraft took off the airline send a message notifying the change of gate. When we approached the gate they told us we missed out flight. They did nothing for us. They has it planned because they did not put out luggage In the aircraft when I was check in on time. So now we have to stay for a whole week repay the covid test again and pay the difference of flight when it wasn’t our fault this airline is so unprofessional.

### "Customer service is terrible"
Do not use this airline if you need to be anywhere at a certain time or date. They will cancel or move your reservation as they please with no compensation. Customer service is terrible.

### "would never fly with this airline"
They texted and cancelled my flight for Friday (6/18/21}, They told me they will give me credit $365/person, we are 3 people, but I have to pay additional $350/person to leave on the same date with LAX destination instead of Ontario. This airline sucks and ripped off, I have to purchase another tickets with American Airlines for the same date 6/18 and arrive in Ontario with the same price $350/person. I would never fly with this airline, I would give Score 0 if any.

### "their attitudes are awful"
Absolutely the worst airline ever. Customer service does not know anything. Took our money for a bag that was overweight 2 lbs & didn't mention we couldn't board anymore. When we asked for a refund the thing behind the counter said she couldn't issue one and that the money belonged to the airport now. Apart from all of this their attitudes are awful. Just their face expressions make you feel unwanted. No person should be treated this way.

### "Avoid at all costs"
Not Verified |  100% would not recommend. Avoid at all costs. If I could give 0 stars i would. Check in is a complete cluster. We were in the check in line for 2 hours and missed our flight. I can not understand how it can take that long to check people in. There is now way to check in on line. Huge mistake using this airline. We booked this through funjet as a charter flight.

### "worst customer service of any airline"
This was my first time flying Volaris and I never will again. First our flight was late. And then customs in Mexico City did not help along with security there either. We missed our flight. When we got to the Volaris ticket counter, there were 50+ people there with us for the same reason. Like how do you let a plane takeoff when this many people are missing but, whatever. I stood there for 3 hours with no help. Every time I tried I was told to wait. So I bought a one way with VivaAerobus (everything was smooth with them) I contacted Volaris later and they told me “We have no measures to compensate you.” Absolutely the worst customer service of any airline. I do not recommend flying Volaris and save yourself a future headache

### "has to be the worst airline"
Not Verified |  This company has to be the worst airline. I just wish I would have checked their rating before I made my reservations. I will give them a 1. Their website is horrible, you can never make a payment. The service is terrible and the price of the cheap ticket is made up on extra fees (like $80 for sitting 5 family members together). Also their are no changes or cancellations possible after 24 hours even though the flight is not for 2 months later. I understand cancellation fees BUT NOT the inability to do anything about it at all.

### "They have the worst customer service"
Not Verified |  Never got to fly Volaris due to the COVID 19 Pandemic. The airline cancelled all flights to my destination and offered me a voucher. When trying to redeem the voucher they replied saying that it was expired. They have the worst customer service, trying to reach them and explain the situation the waiting time for them to pick up the phone would take at least 45 minutes just to hang up on me. I asked to talk to the supervisor or someone higher on line and basically said there was nothing they could do because I agreed to terms and conditions. If you do not want to waste your money don't do any reservation with the rats.

### "they are the absolute worst"
Not Verified |  I had a set flight with Volaris March of 2020 because of the pandemic, I decided not to fly due to being pregnant and considered high risk. I had a valid Drs. note stating that I could not fly yet Volaris still would not reimburse me my two tickets. They made it extremely difficult to get service and finally provided credit vouchers. Volaris gave me until Dec of 2020 to book a flight or lose my money, I ended up booking something in June of 2021 since their calendar only allowed me to book something until July of 2021. My family in Guadalajara are advising that I still don’t fly out there with my baby so I am trying to postpone my flight yet again. Volaris keeps sending me they policy on credit vouchers saying they cannot change flight, date or time due to credit voucher policy restrictions. I understand what they are saying but there is also exceptions that every corporation can make for their customers. You’d think that even in the middle of this worldwide pandemic Volaris would be a little more understanding and have some compassion but nope they are the absolute worst when it comes to their customer service. I am at a potential loss of $1,000 due their unwillingness to help or provide some assistance.

### "refusing to refund me my money"
I was going to travel on May 5th 2021 last minute flight because my grandfather passed away that day. I was going with a group of family members as well. When I boarded the plane I set down got situated, unfortunately I started hyperventilating and started feeling dizziness. Unfortunately I had to get off the plane. I spoke with a supervisor or manager at the airport that worked for VOLARIS. He mentioned to me that I could change my flight or get my refund back but I had to call customer service. Now Volaris is refusing to refund me my money which is almost one thousand dollars. I bought 2 separate tickets one to go to Mexico and other one to return back to Chicago. I think it's really unfair for a flight agency to just keep your money even though you didn't fly. I would appreciated if someone could please help me with this problem. I wouldn't want this to happen to any one else especially if you have a family that only depends on one parent.

### "This service is awful"
Not Verified |  This service is awful. The airline overbooks and sells your seat if you dont pay for it. We stood in line for 3 hours just to be told that we did not check in on time. And still we were an hour early. They said there were no seats available. Then we get to the counter where only 2 agents are working and we stand for 10 minutes waiting while the girl is on her cell phone.

### "I hope to be able to travel again"
I had a nice experience with Volaris. The staff were very friendly and helpful. I felt safe because everything was sanitized. Now I hope to be able to travel again.

### "I will never fly their airline again"
Not Verified |  On Volaris' online reservation, you can only enter a first and last name. I flew from Denver to Tijuana via Mexico City with no problem, even though my US passport has my middle name and my reservation did not. When I tried to leave Tijuana coming back to Denver, I was told my reservation did not match my passport, and while this was not a problem in Mexico, I would not be allowed to re-enter the US through US immigration. I asked it they could modify the reservation to include my middle name and they said no because I had already flown the first part of my trip. They said the only thing I could do was buy another ticket. Not knowing any better and afraid I would not be allowed to return home, I bought another ticket. One which cost more than my entire first reservation! When I got to US customs in Denver, I explained what happened to the agent. He said it was utter nonsense and totally false; that a US citizen will never be denied re-entry to the US, and especially for something like that. I went to the Volaris counter at DIA and explained what happened to them. They said they could do nothing; that they could not refund it, but that I "might" be able to get a travel credit if I called their office. I have tried 3 times to do that. The first time I was disconnected, the other two times they said they could do nothing about it (with the agent on the second call hanging up on me because he said he could not understand me). So now I have filed a dispute with my bank involved to try to get this money back by way of a fraudulent transaction, which this certainly was. And I do not even want a travel credit from these thieves, because I will never fly their airline again. This situation turned an otherwise wonderful vacation into a very very expensive nightmare. I cannot strongly enough recommend that no one flies this terrible airline.

### "I will never fly Volaris again"
I had a flight booked from a long time ago to fly to Cancun. When covid happened my air bnb was cancelled I called the air line with 6 months in a advance to cancel and they refused, they offered to change my flight and charged me 3 times because I kept a thinking covid would end and I didn’t have a choice. I spend a lot of money at the end of the day, I got to the airport and was told my sisters ticket was cancelled. They argued were rude did not once offer me a solution they just asked me to move out of the way and go online if I want another one. I told her, “how is it that I’ve had to jump through hoops and change three flights three times because you have repeatedly told me I cannot cancel my flight and somehow I magically cancelled my sisters flight yesterday and you already sold it! ?” She was like yes you called yesterday and cancelled it and you’ll need to fly another day because the flight is booked. I will never fly Volaris again. And I still haven’t got the any money back for this supposed cancellation. Unfortunately I can’t leave a zero but that’s what they deserve.

### "have been spoken to rudely"
I had a flight scheduled for last year which the airline then cancelled due to Covid-19. I was refused a refund and was instead offered a voucher (which was not even the full amount of the original price of tickets). When I tried to use the voucher to rebook a flight, the voucher code was invalid. I attempted to call the call center multiple times (I was hung up on, ignored, lied to, told that they were unable to transfer me to a supervisor) and was finally told that the vouchers expire 9 days before my new selected flight (even though I was originally told by multiple Volaris employees that the vouchers are good through the end of 2021). Since then, I have reached out to the call center multiple times and have been spoken to rudely, ignored, and lied to yet again. I am out almost $800 now due to the blatant theft by Volaris Airlines. Don't trust them for your travel needs and with your money!

### "they refused to honor their credit"
Not Verified |  The flight was canceled due to covid and I took a credit of $750. When I went to rebook they refused to honor their credit. They said the time ran out. It was good for 6 months and the flying restrictions lasted 12 months . They should have exte3nded the time of the credit to one year. I will never fly with them again

### "airline is very unprofessional"
Worst airline ever. It overbooked the flight, put us on a later flight. By doing that we lost a whole day of our vacation. Every single time I used this airline something bad happened, and it’s always a different thing. Not recommending it to anyone, this airline is very unprofessional.

### "charged me $100 to make this change"
Not Verified |  I booked a few months ago and recently had to change one of the passengers name as the one originally going to travel became ill. They charged me $100 to make this change. Once I received my confirmation of name change I saw that they also changed my return flight to a day later. Called in to customer service to ask about change and they advised they received information that the original flight was no longer available. They then offered to change my flight to a day later, I asked to speak to a supervisor as I will lose another day of work, was hanged up on 4 times and waited about 3 hrs. on hold. When I finally spoke to a supervisor he was rude, and would not offer any accommodates for something we had no control over.

### "the worst travel experience"
Not Verified |  If you are thinking of booking with this airline, please be sure there are no other options available. We had bookings confirmed in May. Come a few weeks before our trip, we are getting dozens of emails about our flights, times changing, layovers, everything. We spent hours on the phone, and throughout all these communications no one ever once mentioned or even implied in the slightest “the flight has been canceled”. We drove two hours to go on our trip all for very rude customer service to ultimately tell us no. Meanwhile, they were letting other people board. It was the worst travel experience of my entire life. I will never book again. Do not book unless it is your only option and even then, ask yourself if it’s worth it.

### "how absolutely disgusting the plane was"
Volaris is absolutely absurd. I paid for carry on bags and when we decided to check our bags in instead, the check in desk representative told us to pay for checked bags and to contact customer service for the reimbursement of the carry on fees. Well, they are refusing to do so even after I showed the below picture of how absolutely disgusting the plane was to Mexico City. It was as if it hadn’t been cleaned in years! That was just from one tray, imagine what the wipe looked like from the seat back and the other tray table. I couldn’t believe it, and the steward just brushed it off as if it wasn’t a big deal. This company has zero customer service.

### "I am very pleased with the change option"
Not Verified |  This is about changing tomorrow’s flight. The T&Cs stated there was no requirement for the airline to change my return flights from Feb 2021 to Dec 2021 but after sending several e-mails to the Customer Services Dept I was allowed to amend the flight dates free of charge at the original flights check-in time. I’ve read a lot of bad reviews of Volaris so wanted to point out the positive service I have had today. Yes it was frustrating not to get a response to my e-mails but they have clearly read and acted on them to allow my changes. I am very pleased with the change option which is everything I asked for in my e-mails.

### "Really angry with and disappointed in this airline"
Not Verified |  Never got to fly Volaris due to covid and what absolutely terrible customer service they have. The pandemic created such a confusing website to navigate and an inability to book new flights, no one was available by phone and the connection kept getting dropped. The customer service finally contacted would have me send weekly emails of which I did - when finally (6 months later able to reach live person) the call center people basically said there was nothing they could do because I agreed to terms and conditions - it was so confusing how to redeem the vouchers and there were no outgoing flights to reschedule to. Really angry with and disappointed in this airline.

### "I am extremely disappointed with Volaris"
Not Verified |  I'm writing this review because I am extremely disappointed with Volaris, do not fly with them because their service is not good. First they charged us for the big luggage which was expected, then they said we had to pay more for the 2 small bags we took aboard with us. This was the first time they charged for small luggage, we had to pay 130 for both of them, it was more expensive then the stuff we had in the little bags. Ridiculous. Another thing is that they didn't even give us food, not one peanut, nor water, they gave us nothing to eat and we were pretty hungry and I'm positive everyone on that plane was too.

### "Do not fly using Volaris"
Not Verified |  Due to the Pandemic, I had to cancel our Aug 2020 trip last year. They would not give me a refund. I got a voucher to be used in 6 months. I am currently using the voucher because they will not extend the voucher. They do not care about the pandemic, only their account. Customer service is friendly but useless. There is absolutely nothing they can do. I have to pay an additional $111 per tix even after the voucher. This is ridiculous. Do not fly using Volaris. They are a negative rating in my books.

### "Please do not fly with them"
Not Verified |  Do not fly Volaris. My boyfriend and I were supposed to go to GDL this month. We went to get tested for COVID and my boyfriend tested POSITIVE. We called Volaris, emailed, contacted them every possible way. They told us we had to pay more $600 dollars to change our tickets. They also hung-up on us, never replied, gave us an invalid email. A lady on the phone even told us we could just fly. They ended up giving us vouchers that were 1/3 of the price of what we payed. We couldn't even buy one ticket for that amount. Absolute madness! Please do not fly with them.

### Volaris customer review
Not Verified |  My review is not for flight but customer service. I bought a flight for my wife and I before the pandemic to Guadalajara and due to pandemic it was canceled. I was told I had 6 months to fly out and when I called before my expiration I asked them if I had to book a flight so it does not expire, the person I spoke to said due to the pandemic they could extend my credit another 6 months. Today I called to book my flight and they told me it expired in December. After explaining what had happened they played dumb and refused to honor my credit. I asked them if there is anything they can do, I'll take half credit or would they rather lose my business, they chose to lose my business. Shows what they think of their customers, they really don't care. I will never book a flight with them. After reading some of the reviews it makes me wish I would have read them before I booked with them in the first place.

### "You don't accommodate your customer issues"
My flight was canceled on the return trip and I was never notified. Before then, the flight was changed twice, and I was assured it wouldn't change again. Now I'm offered a refund to what seems like a 5th of the return flight, without any reasonable explanation. If you are in the business of losing customers, you are doing a great job. You don't accommodate your customer issues. How can you justify my refund being rational compensation for my inconvenience?

### "Beware of this company!"
Not Verified |  We wanted to cancel our flight to Mexico City after seeing how bad the pandemic was getting. However, this Airline has not let me. Instead they wanted me to reschedule for a future date. So I did, but they secretly charged me $600! I complained and asked to cancel the flight once again and to refund me my money, but they won't. They want me to reschedule again for an additional $900. This company is out of their mind. For tickets that I bought for $89 a person (3), I am now spending almost $1600. Beware of this company! They will literally steal your money behind your back.

### "I will never use Volaris again"
Not Verified |  I did my checking on line, Volaris charged me additionally for a change of seat (17.82 dollars), and I wanted to pay on line for my suitcase, The charge said would be $ 55 dollars. At the Volaris desk they charged me $70.00 dollars, for a medium size suitcase that did not exceeded the weight. I will never use Volaris again. Even for a bottle of water you have to pay.

### "not fly with this airline ever again"
Not Verified |  They are the only airline that charges $51 per ticket to change flight. In addition, they charge a difference in price ticket! I will not fly with this airline ever again as they have no consideration over COVID 19 pandemic.

### "Volaris never informed me"
My flight was cancelled just a few hours before the take off. However, I was informed about it by a third party website, Volaris never informed me. I had to call them and they assured me they would give me a seat on the day after. According to the Mexican law and Volaris own compensation policy, Volaris should provide food, beverages, accommodation and transport to the passenger for the next available flight. However, I contacted Volaris and told me to write an e-mail to them to [email protected]. Cynically. They told me that they would take three days to respond, I asked them then to transfer my call to Volaris ground staff at the airport at Guadalajara and they told me that they did not have their number, actually this phone number is not public.

### "What a horrible airline!"
My flight from Puerto Vallarta to Phoenix was cancelled but I only found out about it when I got to the airport. We called Volaris customer service numerous times, just to be tossed from one department to another. Apparently nobody knew how to issue us a refund. They took my email and promised to send me information with steps I needed to take to get my money back. I never received that email. This happened multiple times. When I called complaining about it again they just acted as if not a big deal, not acknowledging my frustration at all! Last time I spoke to their representative, he told me that they only deal with refunds via the email. Okay, I emailed them like 15 times, just to hear no response! How ridiculous is that? What a horrible airline!

### "don’t care about helping their customers"
Not Verified |  Writing this review because just like many on here. I have been on calls for 2-3 hours also being transferred to supervisors that hang up on you. Their customer service is the worse. Our original travel date was back in April 2020. Volaris sent a voucher that expired in July 2020, so I had to use the voucher to book a new flight before then. We booked for December because that’s the latest date they had available in the year. It is now December and our State of California has just closed everything down again. Our county is in purple tier, I am pregnant with a high risk pregnancy. I can not travel neither can my family. I have sent Volaris various emails in regards to this. No one has cared to respond, everyone in the call center tells me either I fly or lose my money. They are not giving us any options. Please don’t travel with them. They don’t care about helping their customers!

### "travel with other airlines"
Not Verified |  I rarely write reviews but I feel like I had to die to the Situation I went thru with the Pandemic. I called to cancel my flight and and get some sort of refund or credit. They said due to me traveling between November and January they DO NOT a give any sort of credit or refund only a change of name or destination with extra cost. I had to cancel due to the stay at home order here in CA and the current high cases of Covid19 and they simply don’t seem to care. They don’t care to treat their customers adequately. I will never recommend you to purchase your tickets if you travel to Mexico. I recommend you to travel with other airlines. I spoke to a rep and a Supervisor and they were NO HELP! When I had called a week before and I was told they were giving out credits for the month of November and I guess I was misinformed by another employee which next time they should all be in the same page.

### "zero customer service"
Not Verified |  I had a very bad experience with Volaris, horrible customer service. Due to Covid19 I had to make changes to my travel plans and dates, they weren't helpful with electronic vouchers, when I finally got them, they didn't notify me of expiration dates, routes weren't available due COVID. And all they say was sorry vouchers have an expiration date. Do not fly volaris, zero customer service. They obviously dont understand how COVID has affected traveling plans and they don't care.

### "Volaris is not taking any accountability"
I was suppose to receive refunds for flights that were canceled due to a Covid-19 travel ban and NEVER received my refund after weeks of emails and sitting on hold with their customer service reps. My parents were suppose to fly out to Central American this morning and were informed last night that their flight had been canceled after they decided to call the airline because they were not able to check in online. Their flights were booked in August and the airline representative told my father that their flights had been canceled and he could not give him an explanation as to why, he simply informed him that there were no departure flights to their intended destination until Late November. How can they cancel flights without giving their customers a heads up? My parents had their bags packs, toiletries purchased, paid for 2 rapid response covid tests and Volaris is not taking any accountability for their screw up.

### "Volaris is basically the Ryanair of Mexico"
Not Verified |  Volaris is basically the Ryanair of Mexico. While the flights might appear cheap on SkyScanner, the reality will be something else. And of course there is the wonder of budget airline customer service. For our next planned trip, Volaris decided to change our flight unannounced to a different (and cheaper) date and different hour, forcing us to arrive to the airport a day earlier and having to book a hotel, and basically losing a day at the destination. And now due to the Covid situation, their marketing has taken a turn to more predatory than ever. Now Volaris has decided not to include the airport tax in their ticket prices, announcing it only at the counter. Formally they describe the tax to be "up to 50 % of the ticket price", but in reality the tax can be more than the actual ticket. No wonder they can afford such "great" deals now, as the ticket price can multiply once you are on their page. No refunds, obviously, only airline credit.

### "stay clear of this airline"
Not Verified |  Had flights booked in April to fly to Cabo, booked hotel and this airline, Volaris through expedia.com. Covid happened and then everything was cancelled. Volaris sent me a credit voucher, which I thought great I can still go to Cabo, and has to be used by 11/22/2020. I go to book my flights and nowhere at the time of payment selection is there a option to use the credit voucher. Try reaching them you say? Oh yes that's near to impossible to do, can't reach them by phone, always over a 2 hr wait, they also recommend reaching them by Facebook messenger and whatsapp. did those too and after the 3rd try had a live person ask for the name and credit voucher, which I provided and then heard nothing back. You send a message and it will take 1-2 days before they respond and then its a chat bot to nowhere land. Worst experience ever and didn't even fly with them yet. Like previous reviews say, stay clear of this airline! Would never think to book with them again.

### "still have not refunded my money"
Not Verified | Volaris cancelled my flights for my entire family. Said they would refund me in June. I have been calling since June and its now September and they still have not refunded my money. When I call, they transfer me to the “finance department” and I sit on hold for 3 hours. Then I called again and they transferred me again, got disconnected. Then I called and asked to speak to a supervisor and got disconnected, then again a second time. Every time I call customer service they tell me I need a different department and they transfer me and I get hung up on. I’ve not gotten to speak to someone yet today, and I’ve been on the phone for almost 5 hours now. They have stolen my money and I will just have to file a fraud claim with my credit card company. I don’t care how cheap the flights are this is the worst service ever and I would rather pay more than deal with these incompetent morons.

### "basically they just took my money"
Not Verified |  Some time in May I booked a flight ticket from Midway airport in Chicago to Guadalajara Mexico. One day before my schedule date to flight I received an email From volaris that it was time to check in. I tried several times to check in but i was unable to do it, because it would not advance to the next part and it wouldn’t let me finish it. I call volaris phone number and I could get a live person to talk to. I need confirmation that my flight was on time but like I said I couldn’t talk to no one. So next day I show up at the airport 3 hour in advance to make sure that I get my boarding pass but I found out an empty place. No personnel behind the desk, and no one to ask anything. So apparently they canceled the flight without notification. Now I want my refund but their website can’t find my information, isn’t that so convenient, so basically they just took my money.

### "failing at their mission statement"
Not Verified |  Here we have a perfect example of a company and a customer service that is failing at their mission statement. I received an email from Volaris letting me know my flight was being scheduled on a different day. Well, my first thought was; what makes the company decide my flights (after I have paid for specific ones) and what makes them think I can continue to travel with all my additional reservations being cancelled due to this epidemic? So of course, I look online and I can't find any easily accessible information to help me understand what's going on. I then turn to calling the company’s customer service to get to the bottom of this. My first interaction with a member at Volaris dropped the call as soon as I was put on hold. No biggie, I call back and go through the mundane steps to reach another human. I reach another member who again, puts me on hold and once again, my call gets dropped. Ok, I can call again as my plans are wide open, but this happened again and again for over an hour. Once I did get through and the agent spent some time trying to explain to me that I wasn’t getting my money back and wouldn’t even receive half of what I paid with airline coupons, I was pretty much done with this company. He gave me a confusing explanation that he couldn’t articulate to the level of my understanding in which case, I asked to speak to a manager. He was unwilling to connect me and told me "there's no manager who can help you as this is the rule and has already been decided". I asked again for a manager and he once again declined my request. This is my first ever review and I would never spend time doing something like this if it wasn't for the fact that I want to help you, give you  the information for you to decide what business you want to help support. In times like these, its about keeping the industry moving forward in a productive way and this company does not care about you or your plans, or where you are heading/coming back from.

### "There is no help offered"
There is no help offered in light of the Coronavirus situation when many other airlines have put in automatic credits or even offer refunds. I had a flight right at the end of March from Mexico City to Los Angeles with them. As soon as California ordered its shutdown on 3/17 I started contacting my airlines. I was able to get a refund from Delta no problem for the flight from Los Angeles to Mexico City. My friends who were also going at the same time as me but on different airlines were also able to get refunds. However, I couldn't even reach Volaris for help. Every time I called, I go through their automatic phone system just to get put on hold and having the line eventually drop my call without me ever reaching an actual person. After over a week of trying to call, I sent an email, while still trying to call, since the website was not helpful either. I've given up with the phone after early April, but to this day, the only response I got from the email was the automatic response confirming receipt of my email. Not only that, but since the start of the virus situation, the other travel related companies I used, like the airlines or hotels, have been sending emails notifying me I had options way before my booked dates. I got nothing from Volaris. Will not be considering them for future travels.

### "taking advantage of vulnerable customers"
Do not book travel with this company. Due to the Covid-19 stay at home order, I attempted to cancel my travel but was unable to via the website. After waiting 7 days for a reply (email, phone, Twitter, Facebook, and Instagram message), I was issued a travel credit. However the credit is only good to redeem within 30 days and they are unwilling to extend the amount of time. This is irresponsible and dangerous as many governments are still advising not to travel. Every other airline is making exceptions. Additionally, you cannot use the full amount you previously paid when rebooking. So they are collecting money from passengers without providing any services. They are taking advantage of vulnerable customers during a difficult time and the company should be held accountable. Hundreds of customers are reaching out on their Facebook page and no one has seen a resolution. If you book travel with this company in the future and need assistance, do not expect them resolve the issue.

### "airline has not even tried reaching out to us"
Not Verified |  This airline is impossible to get a customer service rep to speak to or chat with on their website. Multiple calls and emails to Volaris have not been returned. Covid-19 has Chicago on a Stay at Home order and the town we were going to stay in Mexico on a lockdown. We could not/would not go with the chance of getting stuck out in Guadalajara with a Pandemic happening. This airline has not even tried reaching out to us to offer a credit or refund.

### "I will never fly them again"
This airline is ridiculous. Not only can you not get ahold of anyone on the phone, but they tell you to go to the website. So I do and I cannot cancel, change my name (they got it wrong). I have booked two separate flights with them and lost my money on both as I could not change them. Now with the Covid issue it's impossible. They are still getting my money. I went nowhere this year and I paid them over $700. I will never fly them again.

### "Very disappointing"
Not Verified | Tijuana to Huatulco. Volaris changed my flight date and times without notifying me. This is a cancellation of my scheduled flight. They have no customer service, and will not answer their phones. They will not refund my flight. do not fly on this airline. Very disappointing.

### "not be flying with Volaris"
Not Verified |  Mexico City to Los Angeles. I had a flight from LAX to MEX with Delta, and then a return flight with Volaris. My Delta flight was canceled due to COVID-19, and with a quick phone call, I was given a full refund. I would have been perfectly satisfied with an e-credit for Volaris, but there was no such offering. They did not respond to an email, and when I tried to call, their phone system would cut the call before I could speak with anyone. According to their site, refunds were only offered in the case of extraordinary circumstances, or if your government has restricted travel. The current prevalence of COVID-19 and government advisories against non-essential travel are not considered extraordinary circumstances it seems - but I can't quote a Volaris representative, because although I was emailed a receipt for my service request, there was never any response. When I do re-book my trip to Mexico, I will definitely not be flying with Volaris.

### "bank rejected the refund"
Guadalajara to Los Angeles. I had to email them back and forth to get my refund for a flight that they cancelled. After over 2 weeks of back and forth they have granted me a refund to a bank account that has been closed since I have left America. Because of them being so unprofessional and the delay in the refund, the bank rejected the refund since its over 10 day limit. Thus they still have my money.

### "Terrible service"
Not Verified | Sacramento to Guadalajara. Terrible service. My flight was canceled without notice, the person who attended me at the counter was very rude and pedantic and hid his identification card on top of it without realizing that I had already seen his name. Apart from the next day that they gave me the hoax they charged me $10 for not doing my previous ticket check, it is not possible that apart from being canceled they still charge you for breathing. And not content with that, the young lady who served me had the luxury of telling me that if I kept giving my comments, she wasn't going to let me fly, it's too much. | Pésimo servicio. Me cancelaron mi vuelo sin previo aviso la persona que me atendió en el mostrador fue muy grosera y pedante y encima se escondió su tarjeta de identificación sin percatarse que yo ya avía visto su nombre. Aparte al día siguiente que me dieron el bulo me cobraron 10 dólares por no hacer mi chequeo de boleto previo no es posible que aparte de que te cancelan todavía te cobran asta por respirar. Y no contentos con eso la señorita que me atendió se dio el lujo de decirme que si seguía dando mis comentarios no me iba a dejar volar es demasiado.

### "change was not available"
Not Verified | Tijuana to Oaxaca. Due to the issues of COVID-19 and the closure of the border. I chose to refund my money but that option wasn't available to me because of certain requirements put forth by Volaris. I decided to change the flight at "no extra fee" to a flight in November but flights do not exist past April. Every time I try to change the flight that option does not process through because it says the change was not available.

### "The worst airline ever"
The worst airline ever. How can they cancel a flight less than 24h before departure, then ask me to call them to arrange things, then hang up on me tens of times after making me wait 30 minutes at times? Two days now, I could not reach them.

### "lack of professionalism"
Chicago to Leon. I am beyond upset. I have been a loyal customer of this airline. I tried to cancel my flight due to my airport closing because of members of the airport being infected with COVID-19. I called several times, I been on hold for more than 25 minutes per call. Today, I called 12 times! 12 times! No one answers. I called to their Spanish and English line. No answered. They just keep me waiting there, and then call gets disconnected. I emailed them, no answer at all. I tried to do it online. My only option is within a week! this is a very stressful time. Volaris is making it worst! I do not know what to do now, I guess I am losing my tickets for me and my family to due to the lack of professionalism from Volaris.

### "I could not cancel my flight"
Writing to document another case where needed to cancel trip, Tijuana to La Paz, due to COVID-19 but airline makes it impossible to do. They have a page about their COVID response saying We Are In This Together. Just insult to injury. I could not cancel my flight because it had not been purchased within the past 24 hours. Changing the flight only let you choose from dates up to April 5 2020; a whole week! They do not answer their phones. I did find an area on their website and filled out a generic communication form, but am not hopeful. I also found in searching for other options they have an email address - [email protected]. I will send an email there but again, not hopeful.

### "never given me a refund"
Los Angeles to Guadalaraja via Cancun. They cancelled my flight and have never given me a refund! I feel abused. We save up so much money to try to go on holiday and they have the cheek to take it all away from us.

### "Can't get through to them"
Not Verified | Ciudad Juarez to Cancun. We were going to cross into Mexico at Juarez and board a plane there to fly to Cancun on April 16, 2020. The border has been closed. Volaris refuses to allow me to cancel my flight. They sent me an email stating that I could change my flight at no charge, but on their website they now claim that there are no available flights. They are just going to keep over $1,000. Can't get through to them by phone, they keep hanging up on me while I wait on hold.

### "A nightmare of an airline"
Guadalajara to Los Angeles. Very cramped space in Economy. Staff is polite, but everything about this airline screams cheap. I always print my own boarding pass if I can, but the fact that they charge a service fee for this blows my mind. Even a soft drink on board has a charge. If you need to check a bag and you want to reserve a seat, you aren't really saving any money by the time you pay extra for everything. Might as well pay 5-10 bucks more and get a little leg room. The gate area in LAX was inadequate. They require you to be at the gate about 45 minutes early, but there are barely enough seats in the gate area for 25% of the booked passengers. The day I flew many of the passengers were elderly. No wonder so many of the pax requested wheelchairs. It's that or stand for 45 minutes or more. Foolishly, I made a 2nd reservation to fly to MIA in April, before I had taken my first trip with them. The schedule I booked was a X'n through MEX that was reasonable. They have since changed their schedule, and the only alternatives require 10 hour layovers, all day in LAS followed by a red-eye flight to MIA, or overnight in ORD with a flight that gets me to MIA too late the following day. I am trying to book another flight online, rather than lose the money, but now I can't see my reservation on their website, which recommends that I call Customer service, a very inappropriate department name. I have tried to call repeatedly over the last 2 days. So far, I've gotten to be #2 in the queue one time, I always get disconnected after 5-6 minutes on hold listening to the same line promoting their app over & over. (Hope it works better than their online site and their FB messenger which can only address the simplest questions with "canned" answers.) Obviously their Customer Service is woefully understaffed. A nightmare of an airline.

### "would never recommend"
Not Verified | Sacramento to Cancun. With all this Coronavirus stuff going on we tried to reschedule our trip and Volaris would not let us. We wanted a refund or credit for a future trip and Volaris would not accommodate us in any way. We tried for 4 days to reach them on the phone and we could not get threw to them on phone. Every time we called it kept hanging up on us. I would never recommend this airline to anyone!

### "caused my family and I to miss our plane"
Not Verified |  Mexico City to Los Angeles. Upon departure, approximately 30 minutes prior to the flight I was instructed by a representative of Volaris to go to immigration for a missing immigration form, which I found absurd due to the fact that upon my arrival at Mexico City Airport this form was never mentioned by the immigration representative. When I expressed this to the Volaris representative she tried to wash her hands by stating well you must have arrived initially by bus and it is a different process. I informed her I arrived initially by plane as I had purchased a round trip ticket for my family and I with Volaris. In order to comply with the Volaris representative, I walked to the other end of the airport took an escalator downstairs to immigration received the form the representative was asking for. I asked the immigration representative why was I informed of this form being needed 30 minutes before departure. The immigration representative stated he cannot speak for the airline but it is known fact in the airline industry that Volaris sells more seats than they have available. According to the same representative, Volaris is famous for wasting clients time, providing little to no instruction, and hoping forms are needed so passengers that were sold tickets for seats that were already occupied could have a seat. Anyways, next I attempted to return to my wife and son who were waiting for me at the gate for the plane. Security would not let me return back to the gate without a copy of my boarding pass. The representative for Volaris at the gate did not instruct me to take my boarding pass with me to immigration nor did she inform me I would be unable to return to the gate without it. As a result, I walked to the Volaris service area before the TSA screening and spoke with staff. I informed him I need a copy of my boarding pass so I can return to the gate where my wife and son are waiting and so we can board the plane. He printed a receipt out that looked like a grocery store receipt, I took that to security to return to the gate and they told me that was not a boarding pass and I would not be able to return to the gate. The lack of direction from the Volaris representative at the gate failing to inform me I would need to bring my boarding pass to return to that area, as well as the same representative waiting until last minute to check documents for immigration for all passengers. Additionally, Volaris representative providing me the incorrect document to return to the gate caused my family and I to miss our plane. Because they do not understand how to do their job properly and wasted my time (my family and I were waiting for our plane since 5pm even though the plane was to depart at 8:16pm) my family and I had to stay another night in Mexico City which resulted in a hotel bill, expenses for my wife missing work, and expenses to Volaris to change our missed flight to the following day due to their incompetence and lack of knowledge for the airline industry. Volaris has ruined our vacation, we just want to go home at this point.

### " lost my flight, my money"
Miami to Guadalajara. Requested a change in flight or cancellation of flight upon the COVID-19 outbreak. Flight scheduled on 3/19/20 but talk of closing borders was all over the news. On 3/20/20, the US closed the borders to all non essential travelers. I lost my flight, my money, and trip never occurred. $563 down the Volaris Drain! Hate them for keeping my hard earned money. Hope they go out of business.

### "not fulfilling that promise"
Denver to Mexico City. Volaris has promised to help people cancelling their flight because of coronavirus, but they're not fulfilling that promise. I've tried Twitter, Facebook, email, and phone. Nothing.

### "unable to change our flights"
Sacramento to Cancun. My spouse and I are both Active Duty Air Force and had a leave planned to Mexico with tickets through Volaris Airlines. The Secretary of Defense banned all non-essential travel and thus our plans were cancelled. We were hoping to receive a refund for our flight. We called the number listed online upwards of twenty times and each and every time the Volaris Airlines ends the call without speaking. We tried calling the new reservations line and of course a representative answered but then immediately hung up as soon as we mentioned we already had a booked flight. We went to the Volaris Airline counter at our local airport (SMF) and spoke to the station manager. She was rude and refused to identify her self (she covered her badge when I asked her to identify herself) or provide us with contact information for anyone that may be able to help us. Although my spouse and I were calm and not animated she called the Sheriffs working at the airport, who informed us that it was common for Volaris Airlines to call security to get rid of customers who were dissatisfied. They also obtained her name and indicated all airport employees are required to wear and display identification. My spouse and I are unable to change our flights as she is deploying July and has pre-deployment training in June. I work as a nurse at David Grant Medical Center and am considered essential personnel and have been denied leave until further notice. Based on our experience with the Volaris Airlines SMF station manager we both feel that Volaris Airlines does not respect their customers enough to ensure their safety and are unwilling to use their services. Volaris Airlines should be accountable to their customers. If they provide phone and email contacts they are responsible for responding when their customers have concerns.

### "stay away from this company"
Terrible company! I was checked-in and seated on a plane from San Jose, Costa Rica to Mexico. Just when the doors were about to close, they decided to pull all Europeans off the aeroplane. Due to the coronavirus, they did not allow Europeans in their aeroplane as Mexico would deny entry (as they claimed). This was a lie and Mexico had no travel restrictions (17th of March). I arrived with another airline the day after and there were absolutely no problems with entering the country. Volaris denied Europeans a flight for which we paid a lot of money and lied to us. No refunds are given. Stay away from this company!

### "charging outrages fees to change"
Not Verified | Los Angeles to San Salvador. I have a trip scheduled with Volaris to El Salvador. The president from that country has shut down the airport completely and not allowing entry from any airlines. I called Volaris and they are charging outrages fees to change the flight! It is not fair. I did not ask for the airport to shut down let alone the pandemic! They are taking advantage of the customers and you either pay the change fee or you lose your ticket! This is the first and last time I booked through them! I should have booked through Avianca who is not charging a dime to change flights and are more considerate! Please help us! We are in a crisis and we should not add Volaris to our stress plate

### "money greedy selfish airline"
Not Verified |  Chicago to Culiacán. During this corona virus pandemic, this airline refuses to give people money back. They prefer you to reschedule in 2 weeks. This money greedy selfish airline is the worst. Never again will I fly with Volaris.

### "Volaris is refusing refunds"
Not Verified |  Volaris is refusing refunds during the corona pandemic to El Salvador. Even though the borders at El Salvador are literally closed! You would arrive, get off the plane, and be refused entry for 21 days being a foreigner and put in a holding area. But Volaris is still letting foreigners travel there. The upper management says you can fly somewhere else once you get there. Yeah let’s just pick some other random destination after we fly all the way to El Salvador and deal with the show at the airport there. So irresponsible of them to shuffle customers around like this during a pandemic. The WHO or some agency should shut these guys down. Absolute insanity that they won’t refund flights to a country where the borders are closed during a world pandemic. I’ll never use Volaris again.

### "by far the worse airline ever"
New York City to San Salvador. This is by far the worse airline ever! Due to the recent travel restrictions to El Salvador I had to change my flight. They have the worse customer service! They have not yet wanted to change my flight and I can never get through to customer service stating I had to pay the difference in air fare to change my flights because of something that is not my fault. Save yourself the hassle and book worry free with Avianca or another company who has the customer service and who put their customers first!

### "Avoid at all costs"
Not Verified |  Mexico City to Los Angeles. Avoid at all costs. They have NO integrity and the worst customer service. They cancelled our flight and made the entire plane of people walk back and forth across the entire airport three times. They still never got us a flight. No refund. They don’t care.

### "have absolutely no integrity"
Los Angeles to San Salvador. This airline should not exist. They have absolutely no integrity. They cancel your flight without letting your know in a email or text message. You might be trying to save some money by booking a flight with Volaris but I can guarantee you they are the worst airline ever existed. Just pay the extra $20 - $30 with a different airline and it will be worth it. Please save yourself. It is too late for all of us who have written one star reviews. Do not book with this airline,  you will regret it.

### "Horrible customer service"
Not Verified | Tijuana to Puerto Vallarta. Horrible customer service and so many hidden fees. One of which was the baggage fee. I thought the baggage fee included round trip, as I had bought my tickets “round trip”. Turns out, the baggage fee is on one way. So on the return trip, what would have been a $50 fee for baggage, turned out to be a $110 fee.

### "Avoid at all cost"
Chicago to Cancun via Guadalajara. Don’t use this airline if you're going on a vacation. They cancelled my flight and offered a rebooking 4 days from the original flight, after when my vacation would be over. They offered no refund no voucher, they told me I needed to take that flight or lose everything. They blamed the weather but the cancellation rate at O’Hare was nonexistent except their flight. I had to pay for an Interjet flight that interestingly departed at nearly the same time Volaris was supposed to. Their customer service is terrible, and rude. Avoid at all cost.

### "terrible customer service"
San Salvador to Los Angeles. If you're thinking about flying on Volaris... don't. They have terrible customer service. They decided to remove my bag from the plane 5 days ago due to their own error of "miscalculating the weight" and still have not returned it to me. I went my entire vacation without my bag (no clothes, personal supplies, certain medications, shoes, etc.). I spent hours both in person and on the phone with them, and they refuse to provide any written guarantee or amount of compensation, so I had no guarantee that any sorely needed replacement items I bought would be covered. They still haven't delivered my bag or agreed to compensate me, meaning at this point they have essentially stolen my belongings in addition to ruining my vacation. Last I spoke with them, they couldn't even say for sure where my bag is, yet they still refuse to pay me for loss and damages. Stay FAR, far away and use an ethical, trustworthy airline instead.

### "Terrible customer service"
Guatemala to Los Angeles. Terrible customer service. My bags did not make my flight due to weight restrictions. It’s been 24 hours now and I have no idea where my bag are. The costumer service number on their website (800-122-8000) does not work. I tried an other number. The lady was very unhelpful (please check the website, we don’t know). I’m stuck home and cannot leave as I do not know what would happen if I’m out (would they leave the bag on my footsteps? Return it to the airport? Very frustrating.

### "I will never fly Volaris again"
Not Verified |  Seattle to Guadalajara. I will never fly Volaris again. They lost my luggage and I had to track it down myself. The saying that what's cheap is expensive really rings true here. I did everything I could to not have to check my carry-on bag in Seattle, but the Volaris attendants took it from me at the gate. I worried upon seeing them write GDL and my seat number on the flimsy green tag, wondering whether the bag would really follow me to Guadalajara. My suspicions were confirmed when I arrived to Guadalajara and my bag was lost. I put in a complaint with a distracted Volaris employee (they are severely understaffed at the GDL airport), and hoped my bag would find its way to Guanajuato in the coming days. Of course, further issues ensued. The number the airport gave me led to a message machine and no one ever called me. In fact, no one ever contacted me directly from the GDL airport. After endless phone calls to the Mexico City call center, I learned a few days later that they ended up sending my bag erroneously to Leon. I asked them to send it to me in San Miguel, my next destination, but Volaris GDL never responded that they would. I took matters into my own hands and called the package company and I paid for it to be sent to San Miguel, in total a week after I arrived to Mexico. [Over half of my vacation was spent wearing the same outfit, plus one new shirt, a new swim suit, and borrowed clothes from my travel companions. Overall, the clothing situation was doable - the worst part was the stress of not knowing if/when I'd ever get my luggage back.] After the entire ordeal, the only way I could get compensated was to ask in person at the GDL airport; there is no way to request compensation online. Luckily, I had a layover in GDL (coming from CDMX) or I would never have gotten this small compensation. In all, I received $45 USD for my troubles. The attendees never apologized for what happened, but did process my request fairly quickly.

### "fairly mediocre airline"
Not Verified | Miami to México City. Volaris is a fairly mediocre airline. The staff is polite but doesn't look with really good charisma. Literally everything in the flight has a really high cost, which makes this "low cost" airline into a bad investment. Having a bottle of water is very expensive, and water should be included in every airline. Also, there is really painful legroom; my knees were being crushed against the seat in front of me. Definitely not worth it

### "No apology, no refund"
Not Verified |  Mexico City to Oaxaxa. Arrived at the airport 2 hours before, as directed. Waited so long to check in my bag that i missed the flight. Volaris blamed me. There wasn't another flight until the next day so had to buy another ticket with another airline. When went to find my (checked in) bag, it wasn't there. No staff at the desk. When found one, he told me it was on carousel 6. It wasn't. Finally saw a staff person wheeling it past. Only found my bag by accident, No apology, no refund. Never again.

### "the worst customer service"
Hermosillo to Guadalajara. This airline is an absolute joke. We have been using this airline for years with only minor set backs. Small issues happen, that I understand. However when my family has to stand in line to check in for over two hours, and while in line miss our flight, then we are told that they would not be held accountable for it. Even though Volaris canceling multiple flights is what caused the long lines. Their idea of fixing the situation was to have us buy additional tickets for a later flight. So we are now stuck in an airport with two children for an additional six hours. This is by far the worst customer service I have ever come across. As I said I am a reasonable person and truly understand things happen, but when an airline causes and issue, and they refuse assist in correcting the issue, there are no excuses for such horrific treatment. This will be my family and I's last booking on Volaris. To all who read this please take my words to heart. Do yourself and your family the favor of booking your flight with anyone else.

### "I lost the money I paid"
Not Verified |  Tijuana to Aguascalientes. Avoid this airline. I thought I got a great deal when I booked a flight with Volaris from TJ to Aguascalientes for $150. I quickly realized it was a mistake. Upon arriving to the airport, 3 hours prior to boarding, I was informed my flight was canceled due to weather. Weather didn’t seem too bad, but okay, now what? They rescheduled everyone for another flight that departed 9 hours later. That flight was subsequently canceled as well. Ironically, other airlines were still flying out to my desired destination and I realized only Volaris was grounding their flights. Volaris had all their customers sleeping at the airport like transients for two days while they schedule and canceled flight after flight. Meanwhile Aeromexico customers walked past and boarded their planes destined for my desired destination (Aguascalientes). I spoke with customer service both on the phone and at the airport. Since they couldn’t provide the service I paid for (a flight to Aguascalientes) I requested a refund so I can book a flight with a different company. It was at this time I was informed by the supervisor that all their employees have a strict order not to refund any money back to their customers. They tried to give me another flight to a different destination. WTF, No! I don’t want another flight! I simply want the flight I paid for and if you can’t deliver the product I agreed to pay for, then why wouldn’t you just give me my money back? I got tired and frustrated of dealing with them. I lost the money I paid. I immediately walked over to an Aeromexico sales rep booth, I paid for another flight which got me where I needed to be three hours later with no problems. I received an email the following day with a $21 voucher to use as credit for my next flight with Volaris. Yeah, no thanks.

### "do not recommend this airline"
Tijuana to Chihuahua. The airport of Tijuana was closed for a few pues due to fog. Yet this snow ball has created a lot of cancellations and delays... I am at the airport for 14hrs and nothing solved yet from the airline. The airline personnel has very poor customer service and are shorthanded. The manager form this airline are completely unprofessional as well as their leadership from the airline. I do not recommend this airline.

### "Customer service is awful"
Colima to Tijuana with Volaris. Customer service is awful! I purchase my father’s ticket 3 to 4 times a year and have never had an issue until today. He was made to pay for extra luggage for a 2lb bag and the worst thing is the treatment he received. He’s elderly and called me in panic mode! When I spoke to the customer service agent in Colima she hung up on me! Not ok and they are awful!

### "customer service is so unprofessional"
Leon Guanajuato to Chicago. Never will fly with Volaris Airlines: First of all their customer service is so unprofessional, second my fight was delay 7 hours and the staff didn't give an explanation, we call the manager and they never showed up. my flight was at 7 Am got there 3 hours early and couldn't even make to the check point. They left about 20 people from the same flight it was almost 2PM when we finally boarded the plane. I went and told the customer service that my flight was leaving in 1 hour and there answered was the gates are close and we can't let you in. Honestly I think they over book the flights. Is not the first. Honestly I think they scam people, I call customer service and they didn't do anything. Nunca volare con Volaris Aerolinea. Primer su servicio al cliente no es profesional, segundo mi vuelo se atraso 7 horas and los trabajadores no dieron ninguna explicación. llamamos al gerente pero nunca se presento. Mi vuelo era a las 7 de la mañana y llegue 3 horas antes y ni siquiera llegue al point de revision. Dejaron como 20 personas del mismo vuelo eran casi las 2 pm cuando abordamos el avión. Incluso les deje saber cuando a todavía faltaba una hora y me dijeron que ya estaban cerradas las puertas que no podían dejarme pasar. Honestamente creo que sobre venden los boletos. No es la primera ves. Llame pare reclamar mi queja y ni si quiera my ayudaron con eso. No vuelo si quiere tener un buen viaje.

### "Terrible experience!"
Not Verified |  Mexico to Guatemala. Terrible experience! When I was at the door for my destination, my hand luggage was removed even though the superior behaviors were mostly empty, when I arrived at my destination to my surprise they had lost my luggage and I must say that it was because of negligence of the Volaris staff and have taken time to take it. I would not travel on this airline again: late flight, there are no refreshments (not even a glass of water) and they lose luggage. Pésima experiencia! Al estar en la puerta para mi destino, se me fue retirado mi equipaje de mano a pesar de que los comportamientos superiores iban en su mayoría vacíos, al llegar a mi destino para mi sorpresa habían perdido mi equipaje y he de decir que fue a causa de negligencia del personal de Volaris y han tardado tiempo en llevármelo. No volvería a viajar en esta aerolínea: vuelo atrasado, no hay refiregerios (ni siquiera un vaso de agua) y pierden equipaje

### "never fly with Volaris again"
Chicago to Mexico City. I selected and purchased my seats when I paid for my tickets. They charge you for this, fine no problem. When I printed my boarding pass I noticed the seats were all wrong, the seats were separated and near the front of the plane. I had selected my seats all in a row and in the very back of the plane so I would be right near the bathroom with my 4 children. I asked at boarding why this happened and I wanted to be in the seats I paid for. They said I couldn't be moved because it was a full flight. Ok why did I pay for the seats I wanted then?! She said she would put note in my reservation so I could contact them when I returned. I called and they are telling me they don't know why this happened and I must have selected my seats - no, I know what seats I paid for. When we got in to our incorrect seats there was food on the floor. There is no form of entertainment. No in flight crackers, not even a glass of water. The staff was moody and most were just rude. We fly to Mexico yearly to visit with family and we will never fly with Volaris again!

### "Never going on Volaris again"
Not Verified |  Our plane was at a 2 hour delay at the JFK (New York) airport due to the weather. We understand that. But upon our arrival to the destination San Salvador we found out that our luggage had been left behind. The Volaris staff informed us that we would be called on the arrival of our luggage (we had 4 luggage's for each of us). We waited a few days nobody called us. I went all the way to the airport , finding out that our luggage was still at JFK airport and the flight from New York that had came also left those peoples luggage's behind. We came back after a week to reclaim luggage and go home at JFK but we found out that our luggage was sent back to SAL. We hope a respond from the airline sometime soon its almost Christmas! And no luggage!! Never going on Volaris again!

### "delayed over an hour"
Mérida to Mexico City. Horrible staff. All four flights were delayed over an hour due to inefficient customer service. This airline should go out of business.

### "Horrible experience"
Tijuana to Acapulco. Horrible experience. Flight was cancelled. Waited 4 hours in disorganized lines to find out would not be compensated for it. Absolutely unacceptable service. Outright theft. No plane ever left the ground for this flight, yet they are unwilling to refund tickets OR give vouchers. Their policy is to rebook within 24 hours and use the new ticket within 30 days. I missed that 24 hour window due to their own lack of organization and customer service hours. And how am I supposed to plan a new trip within the next 24 hours to be used in 30 days with work obligations and other things already planned in life? It's a scam to get the customer to spend more money on more expensive tickets and return flights. Horrible policy. Furthermore, the hours of lines were all due to this policy, as people were trying to schedule new flights within that 24 hour window! They manufactured their own problems at the passenger's expense. Refunds or even just issuing vouchers would be so much more efficient and Volaris would not have angry customers waiting in lines for hours! Horrible business.

### "service was disrespectful"
I missed my flight due to a family emergency on a Sunday afternoon. I was dismissed by Volaris representatives in Mexico and told I couldn’t get another plane ticket until Tuesday. Customer service was disrespectful and refused to do anything for me. They made me buy a new ticket (I chose a different airline) and refused to refund me any amount.

### "bump passengers without compensating"
Mexico City to Los Angeles. The airline overbook and use false excuses to bump passengers without compensating. We got to airport 2.5 hr ahead. Had to check in with agent because the auto machine kept dating wrong info from our passports. The agent took time to process our data, kept taking on phone (couldn’t understand Spanish) and after printing my boarding pass, said to us there’s some blockage to print my wife’s. We stood an waited while she continued to process other passengers. Then, she told us we had to go to another line to get it printed. We got same treatment there: couldnt print. Finallt we got hold of another agent and she took us to a separate office; after some 15 minutes she came out and told us we missed the flight because they closed the flight an hour ahead of departure and at that precise time, we were about 5 minutes late! She had our info at least 15 minutes earlier. Later we found another couple had exact same experience of delay but were told different reason : the agent said needed to check on payment and disappeared for over 30 minutes!

### "They refused to let me board"
Mexico City to Las Vegas. They refused to let me board and gave no reason why. They told me I needed to go to customer service to get a new flight and customer service said it would cost me $300 and that the next flight wasn't until tomorrow. This is after they had already changed my flight giving me a 10 hour layover in Las Vegas which is unacceptable.

### "very unprofessional"
Seattle to Guadalajara. We’ve flown Volaris at least a half a dozen times (only non-stop to Guadalajara). They are always rude. They always try to charge more money. Their website is the worst in the industry There Club Class is a joke. You have to take a bus after you land in Guadalajara to get to customs so preferred seating does not make any difference. The customer service representatives at the ticket counter make very unprofessional comments about the passengers if they don’t think you speak Spanish. The worst airline I’ve ever traveled on.

### "Kafkaeske again"
Not Verified | Mexico City to Miami. Avoid it like the plague. I had to change a flight and after 2 hours on the phone I had to explain that the change I made before (for which i already paid) was made from the same flight to the same flight! The fellow on the phone would not believe me. I forwarded the email I received and then he asked ME to explain that email. After all this is your email," I explained that I received that email from volaris.com, stated clearly there. Finally he agreed. This was only the last part of a conversation that Kafka should have written. As I write, they are trying to fix this by charging me $390 instead of $327 as a favor. Kafkaeske again. If by mistake you book a flight with this airline. Just let that money go if you value your time and sanity!

### "is a decent airline"
Not Verified |  Tijuana to Puerto Vallarta. Volaris is a decent airline. On July 2019 I went on vacation to Puerto Vallarta on Volaris. The legroom is decent, the plane is clean, there isn't too many food options, but then again it is a budget airline and the flight wasn't too long.

### "stated that nothing could be done"
Not Verified |  Chicago to Leon. The website stated that if I checked in with a person at the ticket counter I would be asked a fee but that if you used there mobile app it would be free. I had no luggage so this was fine with me. I got to the airport 2 hours before and as I waited in the huge TSA security line, checked in via there mobile app on my phone, there app had some issues, so I was unable to retrive my boarding pass. Showed TSA agent what I had and he instructed me to go back to the ticket counter, after waiting im line for an hr, I approached a Volaris worker walking past TSA and informed them of the problem. She stated that she would radio over to the boarding gate and to run to the Volaris ticket counter which I did. Upon arrival to the ticket counter staff stated that nothing could be done, that it was to late to print me a boarding pass, that that all sales were final. The only thing she could do was to get me another flight to a different state and that i would have to pay a penalty fee on top of the fare difference. Long story short, I ended up missing my fathers funeral because of Volaris and still had to fight with my credit card to fight the charges which after a lot of back and forth with Volaris was able to finally get my money back from my CC even though Volaris refused.

### "will never ever fly with Volaris"
Not Verified | Worst experience ever. We were supposed to go from Guadalajara to San Jose. We arrived more than 2 hours and they made us wait all that time in long lines. We registered our luggage, go to another long line to go thru the checking point we were finally done after waiting in lines for more than to hour we go to board our plane they tell us that we are late. This happened to a bunch of people at least 18 or more. We got together to talk to a supervisor to tell them what they are doing is not right, it was useless he said we had to go thru the line again to catch another flight and to some people they were charging them for another plane ticket. We will never ever fly with Volaris again, we will rather pay little extra then have the same experience.

### "The worst service"
Not Verified | Cancun to Mexico City. The worst service, the lack of information from anybody working for the airline. They cancelled the flight 2h before, offered the tickets for the flight 9h later which was accepted. But obviously, the flight got delayed too, after 9h at the airport. And nobody was capable of answering any questions either apologizing for the situation. Nobody seemed to care at all about connected flights and the delay ended up to be over an hour which made it impossible for us to make on time for our next flights to Europe and the US.

### "Carry on limited at 10 kilos"
Chihuahua to Mexico. Carry on limited at 10 kilos? I carried total 12 kilos with my carry on and small backpack, they insist I have to pay $400 peso, it’s not about money, most business trips prefer carry on, not checked in. at least 10 people were stopped for paying, rep insist pay or don’t get on. T

### "didn't reimburse our flight"
Not Verified |  My husband and I took a flight from Cancun to Phoenix with a layover in Guadalajara. The layover was about 2 hours long, during which time we were sitting near the gate. There were no employees at the desk until 2:30 when the flight was supposed to start boarding at 2:19. At that time lines began to form and the employees began checking everyone's passports. When they got to us they told us that we had to go get a form stamped. We quickly made our way to the booth to get a form stamped and then ran back, only to find that the door had already been closed. This was at 2:50 and the flight wasn't supposed to leave until 3:05. We were not the only people in the exact same situation. There were 5 other people at the desk who had also been told to go get their paper stamped and who had also returned before departure time only to find that they had already closed the door on us knowing that we were all on our way. They could have waited just 5 minutes more and it would have given us all time to get on the plane. So the summarize, they showed up late to start the boarding pass, they sent at least 7 people running to get a form stamped, and knowing that we were all on our way they closed the door 15 minutes early. One lady who missed the plane was left behind as they let her family board but didn't wait for her! And worse of all, they didn't offer any sympathy at all. They didn't reimburse our flight, not even just a portion of it. They didn't offer us a spot on the next flight, not even a discount on the flight that left the next day. They didn't offer us vouchers for a hotel since the next flight didn't leave until the next day or anything. This wasn't just one or two people who they knowingly left behind, it was at least 7 and one of the passengers was separated from her family who was able to get on that plane! We continued to complain to them and all they offered us was $50 each towards a future flight with them, but they gained nearly $900 dollars by refusing to let us on the plane and making us pay full price for the next tickets. And the irony of it all is that they claim to be the "most punctual airline in Mexico" but the next flight we took with them to get home was nearly an hour late.

### "They canceled my flight"
Not Verified |  Las Vegas to Mexico City. They simply suck. They canceled my flight without any notification on my email. When I was about to catch my flight the front desk guy told me (in a very rude way to me and my fiance) that they do not have on my reservation; my big luggage, (Checked Baggage.) Therefore, I have to pay $70 dlls per each baggage, because they gave me a "reward" of "70 dlls" to only use with them in 90 days. What? They are so stupid, they do not understood my frustration that my flight got canceled for the wedding of my sister. They just do not care and they do not resolve my problem. Now I have a flight back with them and I hope, really hope, that I do not have so many problems with them again. This is the first and the last time that I'm flying with a garbage company like them. Simplemente apestan. Cancelaron mi vuelo sin ninguna notificación en mi correo electrónico. Cuando estaba a punto de tomar mi vuelo, el chico de recepción me dijo (de una manera muy grosera para mí y mi prometido) que no tenían en mi reserva; mi equipaje grande, (equipaje facturado). Por lo tanto, tengo que pagar $ 70 dlls por cada equipaje, porque me dieron una "recompensa" de "70 dlls" para usar solo con ellos en 90 días. ¿Qué? Son tan estúpidos, no entienden mi frustración que mi vuelo fue cancelado para la boda de mi hermana. Simplemente no les importa y no resuelven mi problema. Ahora tengo un vuelo de regreso con ellos y espero, realmente espero, no tener tantos problemas con ellos nuevamente. Esta es la primera y la ÚLTIMA VEZ que vuelo con una compañía de basura como ellos.

### "Volaris canceled my flight"
Not Verified |  Flying back from Mexico City Volaris canceled my flight and didn't notify me. At the airport they said it was my fault not theirs that I was stranded the agent said "because my Volaris colleague attempted to contact you and couldn't". They took no responsibility and offered no assistance, hotel, voucher, possible other flights, etc. The agent was rude and arrogant, This is not an airline you should travel with.

### "prices are not cheap"
❎ Not Verified | I flew with Volaris from Guadalajara to New York. The flight was delayed and they did not mention anything until we were on the plane waiting for an hour. Then they said they were waiting for 20 more passengers to get to GDL from Mexico City. 2 hours waiting inside the aircraft. They did not let us get off the plane to get something to eat. I had kids that were flying with me that were hungry and I couldn't give them anything. They also promised to give us all $100 voucher which til this date I have not received at all. I am very upset with this airline on top of all this the prices are not cheap. They have been raising their prices on the luggage which is ridiculous $109 for one suitcase for a round trip.

### "Nothing was organized"
Los Angeles to Cancún via Guadalajara. I’ve travelled to over 50 countries and this airline was by far the worst I have ever been on. By far. Nothing was organized from the moment we got in line at the LAX airport. The airline has a young staff that do not know anything about organizing lines or explaining to customers where to go. The flight itself was extremely uncomfortable. No leg room. Flight home was infested with mosquitoes flying all over the passengers. On the way to Cancun we were told to pick up our bags and give them to the next flight. There was absolutely no direction or sign as to where to take them. We ended up having to carry them on the flight ourselves. Flight attendants again were bad at explaining anything. Flight was delayed by two hours with no explanation. Overall miserable experience.

### "assistance was greatly appreciated"
Tijuana to Guadalajara. This was my first time flying with Volaris. The check in and boarding process at the Tiajuana Airport was a mess and took forever. It felt very unorganized. The flight itself was nice. The flight attendants were very helpful. Your seats are not ideal for someone 6'3" and up like myself. During the flight I began to feel lots a pain in my knees and legs. I called for assistance and staff moved me to more comfortable seat. Their assistance was greatly appreciated. They should be commended for their customer service. I flew on flight KF1P9U on July 1, 2019.

### "Worst airline I've ever flown"
Mexico City to Los Angeles. Worst airline I've ever flown with. The flight was delayed, they changed the departing gate twice, boarding the plane was a total mess, people pushing and the attendants not doing anything to make the boarding process more organized. They did not pass the correct immigration forms before landing Once we landed and got to the gate, they waited 25 minutes before unloading the passengers. On the return flight, I tried to do it online and their website is a nightmare. When I got to the airport, they had given me the wrong information so I had to walk all the way across to reach the Volaris counter. Again, I tried to do it online without success so they told me that I had to wait in line. Their terminal was a complete mess. There were not enough attendants and once I finally reached one, they had a problem printing a boarding pass for me because the computer had me as Mr. instead of Ms! It took them 40 minutes to correct the problem! I proceeded to the assigned gate and then they re-assigned it all the way across the airport! Again, boarding was totally disorganized and the flight was delayed. Never, never had I experienced such disgusting service! I wouldn't recommend this airline even to my worst enemy!

### "We had a good experience"
Los Angeles to Leon. We had a good experience on Volaris traveling from the LAX to Leon and back. The flight was direct. It has the shortest duration and best departure time so was great for the family. And the price was reasonable. It had assigned seating. Just to state the obvious this is a budget Mexican airline. So, I would not come in with the expectation like having wi-fi, super comfortable seats, cabin staff speaking perfect English. But if you view this as a Mexican version of Southwest then you should be okay. Few things I learned about this airline from this trip: 1. Only buy the ticket from the Volaris website. They code share with Frontier so I thought I could just buy the tickets from a generic ticket purchasing website. I ran into trouble (e.g. couldn't select the seats, couldn't get the return flight booked). But then bought the exact same flight from Volaris website with no issues. 2. They actually have reasonably priced food and drink on the flight and accept credit cards. But on the return flight only accepted pesos for some reason. If you really want something to drink besides water bring some pesos. 3. You can print out your boarding passes before you get to the airport and save you some time. But I ran into a glitch where I had to wait until the middle of the night before the boarding pass completed. Maybe it was a load issue on the website. Now that I am familiar with this airline I will probably take it again. Things in Mexican airports can be sort of confusing especially if you're not fluent in Spanish so I probably wouldn't make too complicated travel plans but direct flights with Volaris seem to be fine.

### "worst experience ever"
Los Cabos to Cancun via Mexico city. We had the worst experience ever. We had a flight from los cabos to Cancun and we stop in Mexico City. The flight arrived late in los cabos therefore we lost the second flight that was from city of Mexico to Cancun. We ask for help to at least 12 people from Volaris to see a manager or supervisor and not one help us at all. Once my wife start collapsing I start screaming and someone from the airport help us. So we lost our second flight because of Volaris fault. We lost our car booking ad tour booking. Already was prepaid! Besides loosing around $600 dollars the people from Volaris shout at us! Then they sent us to pick up our luggage saying that someone from Volaris will be helping us to find it which wasn’t true... we had to ask to police, got check again in order to get our luggage. Anyway, this has been the worst experience ever

### "ask for help from attendant"
Los Angeles to El Salvador. As soon that we enter the plane there was a very petite customer (elderly) trying to place her carry on in compartment, ask for help from attendant and his respond to her was “ you have to help me to place and not going to do it myself “ the poor lady tried her best to help the attendant. Walking the aisle to my seat a customer wanted to use the restroom and he was told by an other attendant  to hold it cause he could not use it yet.

### "$60 for a checked in bag"
Merida to San Antonio. I was charged $60 for a checked in bag because it wasn’t on my reservation. When I called before my trip I was told $30 at the airport! $60 is insane. Called the support center and the lady refused to transfer me and refused to talk to me. Kept saying hang up and call for a new person yet she answered the next four times and still refused to transfer me. Worthless.

### "Great airline for the price"
Aguascalientes to Mexico City. Great airline for the price, cheapest price ever. It was on time, beautiful cabin crew. I also flew Phoenix to Guadalajara route many times and it was very economic.

### "get worse and worse"
Las Vegas to Guadalajara. I have flown with Volaris for years for the direct flight but never again. Every year they get worse and worse. They come up with hidden charges and what applied on your way to your destination doesn't apply on the way back. Horrible customer service, the absolute worst across the board. All the employees look depressed and angry. The planes are all old and the safety inserts aren't even in every seat. If you actually have one it's always tattered and dirty. Horrible!

### "Worst airline ever"
Los Angeles to Leon. Worst airline ever. Horrible flight attendant service. Terrible food. No leg room. Most important: I initially paid $607 total for 2 people for RT and seat assigments and one checked bag (of course everything is optional with all extras added on to base fare) Did not seem like great bargain. At the airport, when attempting to check in at kiosk, a screen came up saying that I had to pay an additional 1160 mexican pesos (approx $58 US .) I thought that was error, as I had paid all in full. Went back to try to get someone to help at the check in desk and they refused to let me go up to the desk w/o a boarding pass in my hand and ordered me back to the kiosk. When I asked what the extra fee was for, she told me" tourist tax for non Mexico residents to visit" I never heard of such a thing and no where was that posted on their website, nor stated any extra charge when original purchase was done. Nevertheless, being "held hostage at airport," ( i.e. unable to issue a boarding pass unless forking up extra cash) I paid the fee. After arrival in Mexico, I went to their website and did "help" search and behold the exact quote on site: "Price of your flight already includes all the tourist tax, so you do not have to make any extra payment at airport. They lie to you when issuing tickets and actually collect extra money at airport or else you will not be able to board plane.

### "did not take responsibility"
Volaris flight 5631 Cancun to Guadalajara was 55 minutes late leaving Cancun. We arrived in Guadalajara 35 minutes late and by the time my wife and I got our luggage from the belt and ran to our connecting flight it was almost an hour. We lost out connecting flight because the crew was getting ready to close the aircraft. I was told at the counter if we had arrived at least 20 to 25 minutes earlier we would of made the flight with Aeromexico. Volaris did not take responsibility for their delay and when asked to book us on one of their flights to Sacramento the customer service rep wanted $900 cash for two tickets the next day. Told the rep I did not have $900 cash on me, but would pay with credit card to which he responded "we can't take credit cards". We walked away with the feeling this airline rep was about to pocket some money along with his supervisor who was advising him. I ended up getting on that same flight on their own website and for less than $900 and paid with a credit card. I filed a complaint with Volaris and staff ignored the cash request from their rep and did not take responsibility for their delay nor tried to comp us for a future flight. What he did say was that according to their records the flight was late only 27 minutes and we should of not booked a connecting flight within 90 minutes from each other.

### "look like their depressed"
Guadalajara to Los Angeles. I expect the flight attendants on their best service because as a customer we are paying for all this. My flight was round trip with volaris. The flight attendants dont smile it looks like their unhappy with their job, they look like their depressed. I don’t think this type of crew members should be on an aircraft. I was very dissatisfied of how they treat customers .

### "had to pay 100$ per bag"
Tijuana to Cuidad Juarez. I Bought Tickets through travolocity. In my email verification it shows baggage will be 50$. Getting to counter I was told I had to pay 100$ per bag cause I didn't purchase baggage in advance I'm talking about checked baggage. I spoke to 3 different staff before I could speak with a manager. Who didn't care to see my email and prices listed. The plane ride was very hot. No beverage or snacks where giving on flight.

### "never use their services again"
Mexico City to Oakland. Tried to change my flight online, was getting charged for a checked bag even though I had already paid for a checked bag, so I called the number provided to verify what I was being charged for. When I called the number I was asked to participate in survey after the call. After the call there was no survey. The lady I spoke to was rude and not very helpful. She refused to tell me why I was getting charged for an extra bag ($37 dollars and some change). I told her I could change my flight online and kept insisting that I was not able to do so online even though I had the option to do so in front on me. She said that information was wrong and not to trust it. Made no sense. The flight change online was charging me $137 with some change while she offered $113 and some change so I ended up giving in. Horrible service! Volaris just tries to sell you pointless services you wont use, or be able to use. Will never use their services again.

### "seats worn and uncomfortable"
Not Verified |  I had just hand baggage and checked in online. I had minimal contact with Volaris staff. However, on all 4 flights I took, the seats looked worn and were the most uncomfortable I have ever travelled on on any airline in my 30 years flying experience. And that includes flying on former Soviet era Tupelov spy planes converted to passenger carriers. Volaris was, for me, a great low cost carrier but it doesn't take much to give customers a comfortable ride. Please fix this.

### "was the worst experience"
This was the worst experience I have had on an airline. They were rude and unprofessional towards us. Volaris employees treated everyone (all Mexican) far better than us on our trip from Loreto to Tijuana. During check-in, even though I told the counter person that I did not want to check my small carry on bag he told me I "had to" check it - even though everyone else in front of us and behind us in line got to take their carry-on onto the plane. My bag was small and not heavy, there was no reason to have checked my bag. Also, they would not seat my husband and I together on the plane even though everyone else got to sit with their spouses or friends. The counter man was beyond rude to us. He was not that way when he was checking in others. The staff on the plane were not that much better. Luckily on our trip down to our house in Loreto was on Calafia. They were very professional, respectful, nice, didn't treat us different from anyone else on that plane like Volaris did. Calafia let me carry on my small bag, they seated my husband and I together and were extremely nice and very professional.

### "refusing to refund me"
Guadalajara to Ontario. Selling services that are not being rendered. Stay away go with another airline. I upgraded my seat and paid the difference. When I went to go check in they had sold my seat and sat me in the back row. I requested my money back and they are refusing to refund me. It was their mistake and they are stating that it’s against their policy to refund any money even if it’s their mistake.

### "Do not use this airline"
Not Verified |  Guadalajara to Dallas Ft Worth. Before I traveled to Mexico, I purchased my baggage for $100 round trip, and when coming back they charged me $75 dollars for 2 extra pounds. How ridiculous! I paid because I had a new born that was very impatient about the wait. Our flight was also delayed by 4 hours and the staff rushed us when leaving the airport. I called customer service to get an explanation of the huge charge and they had me on hold for 40 minutes. Do not use this airline. There tickets may be cheap but that is because they steal money in other ways.

### "Just horrible service!"
We went to the machines to print out boarding pass at the Puerto Vallarta airport, the machine told us to ask a Volaris agent for help. We stood in the baggage check in lines (even though we didn’t have a check in bag) and finally the agent said we had to pay 10 dollars (200 pesos) for her to print our boarding pass. What kind of airlines charges to print boarding passes! That should be part of the flight ticket, not everyone has internet to do an online checkin 24 hours before the flight. Just horrible service!

### "All elementswere horrendous"
Regret not taking the terrible reviews seriously. All elements of our journey were horrendous - the check in process was just an absolute mess, queues made no sense and the employee responsible didn’t have a clue. We paid for extra luggage for 4 passengers, were under weight by 10 kilos on one yet over 3 kilos for another suitcase but they refused to let us redistribute the weight and charged us £65. Their customer service claim it’s their company policy which is rubbish because we saw other passengers changing their weight around at the check in desk so may be it’s because we didn’t speak Spanish, can’t think of anything else it could be. We were shouted at by the only employee who spoke English at the check in counters and then shouted again at the gate when we spoke to the “supervisor”. Just an absolutely humiliating, frustrating ordeal. If you can, fly with Interjet or Avianca - we had no issues with them, free drinks and snack and lovely staff who actually smiled. Me and my family have used countless airlines between us and this was by far the worst experience we’ve had. I never write reviews but really had to express how terrible they were so leaving a review wherever I can.

### "last time I use this airline"
We bought 4 round tickets (Tijuana-Uruapan) to visit my mother in law who was sick. Two days after buying the tickets, she died. We paid $628 for the tickets, and the price to change the dates of our flights was $600! I talked to several people in customer service, explaining the emergency, but they all found loops to deny the exchange of the dates at a reasonable price. They did not honor their cancellation policy due to death in the family because the deceased was not my immediate family (my mother in law and grandmother of my three sons who were traveling with me!). This is the last time I use this airline. I rather fly with any other airline to Guadalajara, Jalisco, than using Volaris ever again.

### "I am extremely unhappy"
My family and I traveled with my 91 year old grandma using this airline in January. The airline lost my grandmas luggage and it is now March and we have not been able to retrieve it. Every employee that we have spoken to has been rude, unhelpful and disrespectful. I had a customer service rep tell me that i couldn't speak to a manager because he didn't agree with my story, who says that? I am extremely unhappy. I will never fly with this company again and i surely cannot recomend them to anyone.

### "who knew they were scammers"
Cancun to Mexico City. Since the seats were awful, I thought I would buy Premium Economy upgrade for the return leg of my trip. At the checkin counter, in Mexico City, I asked for upgrade. I paid for it and was promised Premium Economy class. Once I got into the flight, I found out - or I was told by the air hostess - that there is no premium economy class in that flight! WTH, I thought. They said I should be able to get the refund if I called the airlines. I had no time to fight there. I should have recorded their conversation - but I didn't. Hey, who knew they were scammers. Called Volaris Airlines multiple times in the last 10 weeks. They always say "what did you pay for? I tell them. They say "we will send message to Airport" whatever that means. Basically I am out $200. I gave up after 11 weeks.

### "don't stand behind their customers"
Albuquerque to Guadalajara. Do not rent your car through Volaris, rented a car through Them using Mex Rental Cars and when I had issues with my rental, they basically said oh well, sorry for your luck here's a number to the car place - you are  better off booking the car yourself. They don't stand behind their customers, they stand with their terrible partners

### "recommend against this airline"
Highly recommend against this airline. Flew home from Cancun on Volaris, there was a 3-hour delay that caused a missed connection. Volaris's solution was ridiculous. They would not put us on an alternative flight to our final destination. Instead, they flew us to a different city (Fresno) and left us there focusing us to buy additional flights to get home (Seattle). I've never heard of an airline sending you to a different city and saying "eh...close enough" when their flight being late was the cause of the issue. I paid way more buying the extra flight home than I would have if I'd of just bought a flight from a real airline to start with. Never again.

### "reliable low cost airline"
Chicago to Huatulco. Volaris is an excellent and reliable low cost airline. Check in and baggage checking were quick and efficient. The aircraft was new and the flight crew was attentive. The flight left early and arrived early.

### "Worst customer service"
Guadalajara to Dallas Ft Worth. Worst customer service I have had the displeasure to receive. Kicked my family member out of an exit row seat paid extra for months in advance, didn't need to check a bag but had to wait a full hour in that huge line be given a separated single seat at back of plane and told gate agents would need to help, gate agents did nothing to help, in fact after another hour of being mostly ignored by them was told there was nothing they could do - and "I" could contact Volaris upon my return to be given a voucher to compensate for the extra fee I'd previously paid for the one family member they separated to a back row seat! When on the plane we discovered the seat was given to someone that did not purchase seats in advance together but wanted to sit closer together. From now on I am definitely spending a little more to fly American Airlines and  recommend you do the same!

### "Zero communication"
Mexico City to Los Angeles. Worst airline my husband and I have ever flown with. Leg room is non existent in this aircraft, but the worst thing was feeling how the plane may break down anytime because of how badly kept it was. There was a big turbulence and I noticed the armrest handle breaking while a lady next to me was trying to hold tight. Zero communication from the pilot or flight attendant during heavy turbulence. Rude customer service from checking to landing with absolutely no consideration as to what other languages might some customers speak (US customs forms were handed out in Spanish only). Never again!

### "worst experience ever"
Not Verified |  Orlando to Guadalajara via Kissimmee. Not even worth the price, worst airline I've ever been in. Extremely rude costumer service. They wouldn't help with anything and had to throw some items away. Never in my life will I be boarding with this airline. Not even worth the price and worst experience ever.

### "not worth the savings"
Not Verified |  Avoid this airline at all costs even if you have to pay a little more, the aggregation is not worth the savings. In two occasions I used this Airline first time they tried to charged extra money because I was 1.5 hours at the counter and not 2 hours. Yesterday they overbooked the flight from Guadalajara to LAX and moved me and my family to a later flight or the other option was to send us to another airport 1.5 hours drive from LAX where my car was parked. They did not give us any options to stay in the booked flight they forced us into two options. Horrible company.

### "6 weeks to get reimbursement"
Tijuana to Culiacan. My daughter (minor) was flying by herself, they charged her for 1 bag because their sytem showed incorrectly, which we noticed 1 day prior, we called to check on it and we where told it was fixed already, but at the airport they still charged my daughter for it, even though she asked them to check in the notes as we had previously "fixed" such issue but they refused to do so and advice her to leave her bag or pay, of course she paid for it. In our first call to ask for our reimbursement they acknowledged it was a mistake but still took over 15 calls and Over 6 weeks to get the reimbursement but they did a wire transfer which i had to pay for, when it was their mistake 100%!! Worse company ever.

### "last time I fly on this airline"
San Francisco to Mexico City. Never again, Volaris excuses everything on process and others. There’s zero accountability, from changing flight dates and time to swapping aisle and boarding time just few minutes at the airport. Staff is just not qualified to perform a decent job, last time I fly on this airline even if the tickets are free!

### "taking my money elsewhere"
Mexico City to Miami. I called to call centre today to add extra baggage to my flight. Apparently my flight from Mexico City to Miami on 2th September was cancelled due to some operational malfunction as quoted by customer representative. This wasn’t communicated as the booking was done through other website so no mail was send. I kept checking on volaris website until yesterday and there were no signs of cancellation shown in my trips. I explained to him about my connecting flight to grand cayman from Miami that day and asked for alternative flight options. Below are 3 options given 1: fly either on 16th or 23rd. If I wanted to fly any of those days, I would have bought tickets for those days and not 20th. 2: alternative flight to Orlando on 20th ..that too connection through Chicago anyways I would have not reached Miami in time for my next flight. when asked about how to reach Miami .. the gentleman said I would have to take care of that expenses and he would give 1500 pesos voucher for future volaris travels i.e 79 dollars for both passengers in total. After this incident, I don’t think I will travel anytime with volaris again. And how can a alternative flight be to a different location than the destination. 3: when asked if they can get us on any other company flights; which they cannot and the last option provided - refund of the money back to agency which almost comes to ticket price for one at this current time as it is too near to travel date. One thing that I didn’t understand is when u cancel the flights due to ur own reasons; why do the customers like me have to suffer ? ? Why the alternatives provided is not even close to satisfactory.?? I don’t know if this message will make any ifference; but one thing for sure I am taking my money elsewhere to spend next time I want to fly in Mexico .

### "suggest to do your homework"
Tijuana to Guadalajara. I have flown with this airline 6 times and only 1 bad experience. My bad experience was my first time flying with them. I had purchased specific seats for the flight but because it wasn’t a booked flight they said they needed to even out the weight on the plane so the attendant at the gate moved our seats. I told him I had paid for these seats so he said he would put a note in the system and if I called the airlines customer service 800# they’d refund me my money I paid for the seats. I called customer service and basically the guy lied to me about the note. Whatever! - lesson learned don’t pay for specific seats just let the system choose them for you and you don’t have to pay. The on board airplane staff is always nice and courteous. They have sandwiches and snacks that are not overpriced on board. They will have people at the gate sometimes asking if you want to check in your carry-on free of charge because there’s no room in the overhead compartments. They have an app I use every time that is very convenient. You don’t need to print a boarding pass because the app has it on there, simply take a screenshot just in case your phone fails to load at the airport. Check in on the app before hand and purchase any add ons like luggage, extra weight to luggage or special seating ahead of time before you check in so they don’t charge you heavy fees for doing it at the airport. I learned how to work with them and for a low cost flight I don’t mind flying with them. The only terrible thing about them is their customer service at the 800#. I learned you don’t really get anywhere with them so don’t use their airline if your plans are susceptible to change. I suggest to do your homework, check in ahead of time and be at airport at least 2 hours early to be safe of any overbooked flights and so you can check in your Bags. Make sure your luggage doesn’t weigh over the limit. Check in using the app and save a screenshot of your confirmation # plus boarding passes. Overall my experiences with booking flights with this airline using the app and flying from the Tijuana airport to Guadalajara and back again haven't been terrible. I Will continue to fly this airline within Mexico.

### "worst airline ever"
Torreon to Guadalajara. The worst airline ever. Although the ticket prices appeared to be cheapest, it quickly added up as they charge for selecting your seat $12.95 US, luggage $50.00 per luggage piece one way, and if you require more leg room, you can "upgrade to the first row seats labeled as Premium for $17.00. the flight attendants do not greet passengers upon boarding and once you land, the captain/first officer leave the cock pit to chat with the flight attendants and the staff ignored the passengers. At the airport we learned of their app, which allowed passengers to go through an expedited lane -On our way back staff in TRC were charging from $5-360 pesos to help passengers download it! We reported a broken seat on our way back - GDL - SMF - to the only flight attendant that was greeting passengers, "Ivon", and she acknowledged the broken seat and offered to report it for future flights, but did not offer another seat, because they were full to capacity, even though they had just offered Premium seats for sale! If you want a cheap transaction flight without any level of service, this is it. otherwise stay away from it as far as you can!

### "never fly this airline again"
Not Verified |  Fresno to Cabo San Lucas via Guadalajara. Horrible airline, was unable to check in via website for return flights. I was able to check 4 out of 5 family members in which required a visit to the ticket agent once at the airport. I was informed at this time that I would have to pay $7.00 + pp to print boarding passes. My family and i traveled from Cabo to Guadalajara for a 1.5 hour layover. Once boarding started for the final leg we walked into a plane that was completely inundated with mosquitos. Once everyone was seated the airline staff began spraying an aerosol product above the cabin storage bins. This helped with the mosquito situation but created concern as to what was being sprayed and recirculated through the plane while we were seated. The staff made 4-5 passes through the plane using this aerosol product. Will never fly this airline again.

### "This is ridiculous!"
We had booked a round trip flight from Los Angeles to Guatemala City. Volaris cancelled twice without sending us adequate notice. First cancellation we received a vague email with 'call for an update', we rebooked for the next night. Just a few hours before we were going to again drive to the airport (3 hours from us), we just happened to call because a flight confirmation was sent to us that said we were booked at a hotel in Brazil, which we were definitely not! Volaris said our flight was cancelled, this time due to 'weather', we rebooked it again for the next night (now shortening our vacation by 3 days). Right after, we looked up the 'weather' in Guatemala - there was a volcano eruption that killed over 60 people near where we were going to stay! Not wanting to breath poisonous gas, be covered in ash, and go to a place in crisis, we called Volaris to cancel and were told there was no way to change the date or the destination without a $972 change fee! This is ridiculous! We waited on hold for over 30 minutes and we were transferred to at least 6 different departments with everybody saying the same thing-- no real options, so we ended up just eating the money we spent on the 2 flights. Very frustrating!

### "I would fly them again"
❌ Not Verified |  My sister and I flew from Oaxaca to Los Angeles and had a great experience. The flight was on time, the crew was very friendly, and the seats (premium) were comfortable and roomy! I would fly them again.

### "Avoid at all costs, scammers"
Mexico City to Cancun. Avoid at all costs, we were triple charged at the airport for the flight, they said our payment was not processed even though we showed them the funds had been transferred. They said we had to pay them cash now at the counter to get our boarding passes printed. We had no option as our trip was organised for the next day. Avoid at all costs, scammers.

### "staff very rude"
Puerto Vallarta to Chicago via Mexico City. I flew back this morning from Nuevo Vallarta MX connecting flight to Mexico City at 1:55am, they changed the gate 3 times in Mexico City, Volaris was disorganized, boarding staff very rude and refused to help us, the boarding employees took our filled immigration form at Puerto Vallarta when we check in and we have nothing to show to boarding employees in Mexico City we need to paid extra $63 to filled another immigration form and go thru again from security checked, thanks it was delayed for an hour we need to run back and forth, we hardly made it, there’s have more customers same problem what we had.

### "awful customer service"
Mexico City to New York. I wanted to get home to Ireland from Mexico City, and I chose this airline because it seemed cheap. I bought carry-on that was under 10kg and I bought a litre spirit of Kahlua to give to my airbnb host's when I got to New York in the duty free and Volaris charged me an extra 25 dollars for the thing I got in duty free.I did not know that was allowed, and it might not be. I wanted to get home to Ireland and had to pay it because they would not let me on the plane without paying it. Awful customer service. Then I tried to get my money back and every single customer agent speaks Spanish when I called in English. On my return to Mexico City from Ireland, I had to fly with them again. They charged me 25 dollars when I bought the ticket because I was not Mexican even though the extra charge was for non-residents which I am so I should not have paid it. When I went to call them they said that I should not contact them I should contact the tax people instead even though it was their fault. Absolutely awful customer service. When I flew with Norwegian and Wow Air on these journeys they had no problem with anything. Horrible customer service from Volaris and I did not enjoy my flights with them.

### "avoid this airline if at all possible"
My Volaris flight from Huatulco to Guadalajara was cancelled with 24 hours notice. This was in itself very annoying because I had to book a new flight with Aeromexico which cost $500 (2 PAX) as it was last minute. No reason or explanation was given but I suspect the airline had undersold the flight so consolidated two flights. To really add insult to injury the problem I have then had was getting a simple refund of the ticket. The airline never responds to email and I have had to call customer service each time. With each phone call they have requested a different thing. So first I had to provide my bank details, then they wanted a copy of my ID, then a bank statement proving my bank was my bank and the latest is signed letter from my bank authorising they refund me! I have visited over 100 countries and travelled on counless airlines. My advice would be avoid this airline if at all possible. It has the worst customer service I have ever experienced. In my case, they have taken my money, failed to provide any service at all and a year later I am still struggling to get my money back and that's just the ticket price. Forget about the substantial out of pocket expenses caused by the cancellation which I won't get back. Pay a little more and fly with a proper airline is my advice!

### "Worst airline I have traveled"
Oakland to Morelia. Worst airline I have ever traveled with. Sells you something that they cannot deliver and charge you extra for ridiculous things never charged by other airlines. For instance, I was charged extra for a carry-on of a weight of 12 kilos 2 kilos more than "allowed", had never heard of that with other airlines. My bag was small just had my computer, camera and makeup as carry-on. not even close to exceeding the size allowed as a carry-on. I was charged $50.00 for 2 kilos. I also paid extra when checking-in for extra leg space. When I got to my seat 4F, the space was no where to be found. There is no inflight entertainment. The aircraft was old and with bad smell.

### "couldn't bring it as a carry-on"
Toluca to San Jose Del Cabo. Everything seemed fine until I got to customs. My aunt had given me a small gift made of stone and pine to bring to my parents. Long story short, they told me I couldn't bring it as a carry-on and would need to check it in,  for the equivalent of $100 USD. A word of advice: Don't fly Volaris. If you have no other choice, make absolute sure that you're not bringing anything that could be misconstrued as 'unsafe'.

### "customer service is awful"
Seattle to Guadalajara. Their customer service is awful! They overcharge you, it may seem like you are saving when you are purchasing your tickets, but you are not, they will charge you everything and empty your wallet. The lines to check in are also insane. I’d much rather pay $100 more to fly on another airline, that is how bad it is.

### "I had a super experience"
Guatemala City to Managua via San Jose. We gave it a try on November 27th from San Jose CR to Gutemala City. Great flight! Super friendly staff, recent aircraft and even arrived before schedule time. No problem whatsoever with our luggage. We then decide to try them on a last minute flight: Guatemala city to San jose and San Jose to Managua Nicaragua. 2 flights same day. Great experience again! Both flights were on time, crew was great and no problem with our luggage : they arrived at the same time super fast! I had a super experience with Volaris 3 times in a month. I keep In mind the price.

### "Poor customer service
Flew Volaris from Tijuana to Mexico City. Made reservations a few months ago. I received my confirmation, flight number, gate and time. I printed my reservation a week before. When I got to the airport, they had cancelled that flight. I never received any updates. So I had to wait 23 hours at the airport. I wasn't told till I was at the gate getting boarded. They suggested for me to go to downtown Tijuana at 2 am, not safe at all. The reservation also stated that luggage should weigh less then 55lbs or a fee will be applied. My baggage weight was 43lbs and they still charged me a fee. I'm 6 feet, 215lbs and I did not fit in those seats. When the passenger in front lowered their seat, my knees where hurting. Do not recommend this airline. Poor customer service.

### "worst customer service"
Cancun to Aguascalientes. 5 hours delay, meals compensation tickets for $8 us dollars (one coffee at airport), worst customer service experience. If I could I wouldn't fly again with this airline. Manager in a really bad attitude. My luggage was 10.4 kg. And they charged me an additional luggage for $25 US just because of 400 grams. It is supposed to be better than a economy airline but other economy airlines do it better and cheaper.

### "do not fly Volaris"
Puebla to Tijuana. Zero stars would be a more accurate rating. This airline, is unprofessional, unreliable, and dishonest. They do not communicate with their customers about delays or changes. The staff have lost any empathy and concern. They bring back people to them by offering 80% off, but you will pay for it. I had a 9 hour delay in Puebla, they had us sit in the freezing airport overnight, when 24 hours in advance they new that the flight was going to be delayed. Yet they had close to 200 passengers waiting, with no communication, no accommodations, and no answers. The flight was not cheap and to that, add a day of missed work due to the delay. They will continue this behavior until we stop flying with them. So my advice, do not fly Volaris, you will regret it, you will learn the hard way. I do not base my review on one experience, it has happened multiple times.

### "save yourself the disappointment"
We are currently living the hell that Volaris puts you through with their CBX flights. First of all, I am traveling with my 3yr old and 6 yr old from Tijuana to Cancun and booked my direct flights for the thanksgiving holiday in February. Two days before I thought I was departing I saw that my dates with my hotel stay and flight schedule were not matching up so I called the airline and they said they had to change it because the flight was either cancelled, had technical difficulties or what not. I asked them why they hadn’t sent me an email verification when this was switched and the rep on the phone said “we usually do, I don’t know what happened”. I asked what date they would have sent such an email and he didn’t have one for me to verify. The rep proceeded to tell me that unfortunately all of the direct flights were booked and the only ones they had available were ones with 6 hour layovers to and from. Since I had no choice I took it with a compensation of 1000 pesos per passenger for a future flight within 6 months with Volaris. The layover was brutal with my little boys and they ended up getting sick because of the over night layover so their fun vacation was ruined and constrained to sleeping and medicine in the hotel room for 3 days. We mentally prepared ourselves for the brutal way back and we waited it out at the airport in Mexico City from 25th to the 26th and 5am when we were supposed to board our flight back to Tijuana. At 5 am volaris announced that the flight was cancelled due to weather without further notice. They cancelled 2 more Tijuana flights after that and there were riots and very angry customers. They weren’t worried about solving the problem whatsoever. Since I was traveling with my kids I chose to hide out in the Grant Elite in Mexico City which was a saving grace. My husband was able to get a flight that wouldn’t leave Mexico City until 1:53pm and not to TJ but to Puerto Vallarta where we are supposed to get a connect to TJ but not until another 4 hour layover. We just landed in Puerto Vallarta and asked the rep if we were going to be able to take off or not for TJ with the weather, and her response was “it looks like everything is on time and weather seems good, but if anything changes we will let you know”. So now the dilemma is if we wait 4 hrs to find out we can't get to TJ another night when we could (out of our own pocket because Volaris won’t compensate anything) get a hotel for our babies to finally get some good rest after 24hr airport hell! I’m so disappointed and will never fly Volaris again. Save yourself the disappointment and pay the extra money to fly internationally and preferably not with Volaris. Beware of the CBX / TJ trap as well because they made us fork out $300 just to enter into Mexico, but when we argued we were only vacationing a week the airport immigration man said that since we were “already in line we had to pay now”. Then after a rush of people started coming he went to the immigration desk and started stamping passports — no longer making people stand in a side line to pay.

### "cancelled our flight again"
Cancun to Tijuana. Volaris cancelled our flight again. Just an e-mail, no calls, no options. Supposedly due to weather. Customer service hanged up on me twice. Worst at the counter. Make up flight delayed three times, and finally took off at 4:36am, from the original time of 6pm the previous day! This has got to be the worst airline in the world!

### "never fly this airline again"
Los Angeles to Cancun via Mexico City. One of the worst flights I’ve ever taken. My original Flight was cancelled and I was sent a text message in Spanish. I called customer service and it was like they didn’t even realize what an inconvenience it was to change. Our flight was delayed from LA and we almost missed our connecting flight from Mexico City to Cancun. Our 2nd flight was delayed to Cancun as well, with no explanation. Very poor customer service and serious language barriers. I will never fly this airline again, the headache isn’t worth the money saved.

### "pay extra to fly a real airline"
I am traveling with my 3 year old son, I looked online to see if I could find information / cost about taking his car seat and stroller, I could only come up with info on minors under 2. I called and spoke to an agent and then to a supervisor, they both tell me they cannot offer me a price on what it would cost if I wanted to take my son's car seat and stroller, those prices could only be determined at the airport. I explained to her that how could I take it not knowing the cost and then possibly be charged some outrageous price and have to leave it behind. How is it possible that as an airline you do not have an option for parents traveling with toddlers? She said that it was possible that I could be charged upwards of $100 as extra luggage for his stroller or car seat, I explained but this is not luggage and I would be checking it at the gate, again she said I would have to find out cost at the airport. Again I questioned how is this possible, I need to know the cost before I decide to take it or not other than risking having to leave it behind at the airport, well apparently they do not provide that service for parents traveling with toddlers. Do yourselves the favor and pay the extra cost to fly with a real airline who has a clue.

### "airline is pretty messed up"
We purchased a one way ticket from Mexico City to Los Angeles for Feb 26, 2017. On Feb 22, we received a notification saying that the flight was cancelled. I called the number given but was either put on hold or the one who answered can’t speak English. The phone reception was poor. I googled their other number and was put through. They booked me on a flight on Feb 25 but charged us $99.00. I felt that since the cancellation was caused by Volaris and not by me, I shouldn’t be charged. I filed a dispute with my credit card company but lost. The whole airline is pretty messed up, from the check in process which requires 3 different pieces of paper to onboard service. This is the second time I flew Volaris. The first time from Los Angeles to Guadalajara. The flight was delayed by almost 4 hours with no explanation. This time the flight was cancelled and we have to check out early from our hostel and have to pay a 50% penalty and of course no compensation. To make matter worse, my friend luggage was lost. My friend called so many times to ask for compensation. Volaris used a contractor and the contractor refused to compensate him. In the end, he got nothing back. I have been flying frequently since 2006 and this was my worst nightmare. I feel that the airline didn’t do enough to help. The last time I flew on a Mexico carrier was on AeroMexico. The airline supposed to fly to Los Angeles but end up in Tijuana and that was it. No more Volaris. I know it is cheaper but it is not worse the trouble. If you have a choice, spend a few dollar because we don’t take vacation all the time. If something goes wrong, you can’t count on Volaris to help you out.

### "It is good value for price"
Flew Mexico City to Villahermosa with Volaris. There were no problems with this and two more flights. The staff were very helpful with free printing of the tickets. The plane boarding was on time and quick, plane landed even earlier than it was written in the ticket. The seats were comfortable, no problems with carry on baggage. It is good value for price.

### "never use Volaris again"
I bought a round ticket from Mexico to Austin, I bought and insurance they offer in case I needed to make a change, it is useless they will change your route at their convenience anyway. I checked in on July 5th and it took me 90 minutes to get checked in at the Volaris desk. The problem they cancelled a flight and had over 20 people complaining about it and their personnel was focus only on those passengers without taking care of the rest that were waiting. Long story short after complaining we were able to check in and needed to run to the gate because they didn't care- flight over booked. I'm flying back on Oct 4th from Austin to Mexico thru Guadalajara. I called to make sure everything was Ok with my flight and surprise the flight from Guadalajara to Mexico has been cancelled so they needed to reroute me through San Antonio - but I'm in Austin well they didn't care and won't pay for transportation, they make their problem my problem and didn't care a bit. I requested they they booked me in another airline but they rejected to do so, and they can't reimburse the ticket because it is all bought at once like round trip. To solve my problem for choosing Volaris, I needed to purchase an extra ticket with another airline from Guadalajara to Mexico City. They offered a $1,000 voucher for future flights, but would you trust Volaris again - I definitely won't. If they would care a little they had my mobile and email to contact me in advanced to solve their problem but they decided not to, they were expecting me at the counter the day of my flight to surprise me and expected me to stayed in Guadalajara for a night at my own expense. I will not recommend anybody to travel with Volaris there are other airlines options within Mexico and overseas. Lack of customer service or interest to provide any assistance to their customers. Very disappointing. Will never use Volaris again. Ground services, seats comfort, food, beverage, etc have no relevance when the main service is denied like they did which is taking you from point A to B which by the way you have already paid for it. If you want to have a nice experience with your travel flight plans don't choose Volaris.

### "miles behind others in its class"
Mexico City to Puerto Vallarta. Mexico's budget airline is miles behind others in its class. After booking two cheap flights (chiefly because 1 free bag is included), we were greeted with the rude awakening of getting what you pay for. Horrendous customer service, shady booking practices, no legroom, dirty planes, flight attendants with attitude, and questionable pilots. We even made the mistake of booking two flights before we knew what we had done. The first misstep we encountered was right from the get go in the booking system. They try to "offer" you a second bag (that they add on to the reservation by default) on top of the already free first bag for an additional $30. If you don't catch it, good luck getting any money back as Volaris customer service has a "politic" of no refunds even if that extra bag was never even at the airport - a fact that would easily be verified by seeing the extra bag tag was never scanned. They also seem to take up a position of passing off customer service to other departments as we called the call center's Mexican number only to have them tell us to contact them in writing. Upon doing so they tried to send us back to the call center and even gave us a US number (since we needed English assistance it would seem) that was not in service. When the written response produced no results, we were told to contact the feedback department to tell them about our experience. It was at this point we’d had had enough and felt we should warn people and help them avoid our nightmare instead. After that, the hits just keep coming. Dirty undersized/broken trays. No legroom at all even for a 178 cm tall (5' 9") person sitting next to us. To top it all off the flight attendants on our flight from Guadalajara to Cancun ignored us and never brought the water we asked for even when they were walking by with the drink cart. Is this assessment of Volaris' business harsh? Not likely from what we've heard, and also not from our personal experiences with them and other carriers. If we were to recommend a Mexican airline for your travels (which is also the airline our agent recommended in the first place), Interjet's legroom was fantastic, drinks were good, flight attendants were polite, and we never had a reason to deal with customer service so our rating for them is a solid A+.

### "express my great dissatisfaction"
Guadalajara to Chicago. I am taking the time to express my great dissatisfaction with my family’s experience while flying with the Volaris Airline. I am responsible for purchasing and organizing my mother’s flight during her vacation, she required a direct flight and that is what I confirmed when I purchased her flight ticket. On the way to Guadalajara, all went well and she made it safety to our family. However, on the return, she went to the airport at 5pm to catch a 7:15pm scheduled flight that apparently did not exist. She had a reservation that was not respected by the airline. We were never notified of the change until she stepped up to your ticket counter to check in. The airline has my email and phone number that would have made us accessible. But we received no communication about the change. My mother was made to believe that she mistaken about her reservation despite showing the ticket counter a screenshot of her reservation. Other patrons who complained at the same ticket counter over the exact same reason must have put up a better fight than my mother because she witness how a group of 5 women were put on a direct flight with sister airline. My mother is not the kind of person who would behave belligerent in public, I only regret not being present by her side to advocate on her behalf. She was put on a flight that had a 6 hour layover to Mexico City, only 2 days after a major earthquake , which not only made it undesirable for anyone to travel to Mexico City, it was also unsafe. She was hungry, tired, and she received no apology for the unprofessional flight experience she received. You can be sure that I will never reserve any flight with Volaris and will be sure to let everyone we know about our experience with this airline. I suggest that if Volaris sells a flight ticket, that they also inform people that their flight is subject to be changed without any notification, unless you purchase for additional amount their flight insurance . Evidently, that was necessary to insure that she actually keep her direct flight.

### "never recommend this airline"
Guadalajara to San Francisco. I will never recommend this airline to any person flying to or from Mexico. My complaint comes from their lack of competency. On August 7, 2017 my family and I were flying back home after a two week vacation in Mexico. Our flight was scheduled to depart from Guadalajara International Airport at 7:16 am local time. We got to the airport about two and a half hours before departure but the airport was a complete mess from all angles. people lining up in lines that just went in circles and agents sending people to lines for domestic flights when they were flying international and vise versa. After about two hours in line and only minutes left for our flight to depart, it was finally our turn to get our boarding passes. I handed the ticket agent our passports along with my wife's U.S. green card. The agent scanned my kids passports and mine before getting to my wife's passport and green card. After the agent looked at my wifes passport he asked for her green card. My wife and I insisted to the agent that the green card was handed to the agent along with the passport but to no avail. After asking the agent to look around him to see if he had misplaced my wifes green card, he asked us to step aside to tend to other passengers. When he was done with the passengers he asked what we, as a family, wanted to do in regards to only my kids and me fly back home or if we all wanted to stay. While I was arguing with the agent to look one more time around him, I saw the Green card next to him in sight. After seeing that he had made a mistake and almost kicked my family off a plane due to this agents carelessness, the agent made no effort to apologize and stayed silent.

### "Avoid using this airline"
Guadalajara to Sacramento. I arrived at Guadalajara airport 3 hours before my departure flight at least that was what the airline requested all passegengers to do, the Service crew at Guadalajara airport had only one line for all international flights that included Portland, Oakland and Sacramento and some other flights so try to imagine how big this line was they had us waiting 2 .5 hours standing waiting in line to be checked in. They did not had enough personnel to accommodate all international flights in one single line, all passengers were really tired and upset to the point that one customer started confronting the ground crew and all passengers applauded this passenger for voicing their frustration so obiously we end up departing late from Guadalajara to Sacramento. Avoid using this airline at all cost.

### "never make up for their mistakes"
Tijuana to Culiacan. I have been flying Volaris for years now. I love the flight, but hate how they constantly screw the customer on any changes or cancellations. I guess they get away with it because they are a Mexican company. the latest fiasco was I purchased a ticket. 3 hours later tried to cancel, but they wouldn't let me and get my monies back. I spent hours on the phone with them. They tried to change my ticket instead. they only had change flights that were non direct, probably knowing I wouldn't do it. The direct were available per the online booking, but they never showed those flights if you wanted to change your ticket. It went on and on and on. hours and hours. They would never make up for their mistakes which were numerous.

### "service was horrible"
Querétaro to Cancún. I am flying with a 8 month old, a 5 year old, a 12 year old and my wife. My 8 month old baby carriage is a two piece as most of them are since she is so young. One is the baby seat and the carrier. We called ahead of time and made sure we could take it and we were told that we had to check it in as one of our bags, which to start is crazy since many airlines allow you to take your stroller to the door if the plane and check it. When we approach the service desk they wanted to charge it as two separate bags. Stroller being one and the car seat being the other. We told them that it's one stroller but it comes in two pieces due to the age and they did not want to hear it, just wanted us to pay for an extra luggage. After a 5 minutes argument I found a garbage bag where I folded my stroller and place both the stroller and car seat attachment into the plastic bag and finally was able to check it as one bag. The service was horrible and I will not recommend this airline to any one traveling with young kids.

### "seating is too cramped"
Guadalajara to Sacramento. I am a partially disabled senior and I fly back and forth across the border with a cat. I cannot recommend Volaris. The seating is too cramped for a 4.5 hour flight (I am not tall or obese). The desk attendant at the Guadalajara airport lacked training and was unable to deal adequately with my situation. I was charged additional fee for my checked luggage as between the time I booked and paid for the flight, rules had changed, and did not get the seat I requested and paid for. Kind seatmates on the plane interfered for me as the stewardess did not speak English and my Spanish wasn't good enough (or she just didn't want to listen). You are truly pesoed to death on this airline. Everything but a cramped plastic seat is mas dinero.

### "least legroom I have ever tried"
Puebla to Cancun. Quick check in in smallish Puebla airport. Service was ok for a budget airline and the plane left on time. Ticket was pretty cheap. Believe had bought an extra which allowed bags to be checked. They were out of food and snacks for sale. Had the least legroom I have ever tried.

### "saving the money was not worth it"
My girlfriend and I live in San Diego, and saw that it was cheaper to walk across the Mexican border and fly out of Tijuana to Cabo San Lucas then it was to fly out of our regular airport we like to use, San Diego Airport. We saved about $300 total on our flight. However, saving the money was not worth it. When we got to the airport, we arrived 1.5 hours early. The staff said we could not check our bag for an hour. About an hour passed and we were furious and they allowed us to check our bag - but don't worry, they charged us an extra $50 for our bag we had already brought on the way there. When we finally got into the terminal, we noticed that our flight should have been boarding, and we asked the front desk why we were not. They said they didn't know. We googled our flight, and it said it was delayed for 5 hours because of the rain, it was 85 degrees and sunny outside, both in Cabo and Tijuana. We are so frustrated with our experience and will never fly with Volaris again.

### "not be flying Volaris again"
Mexico City to Los Angeles via Guadalajara. I had a reservation on Saturday Feb 25th for a nonstop flight from Mexico City to Los Angeles, departing at 11:37am, purchased weeks in advance. On February 22nd, just a few days in advance, I received an e-mail saying that my flight was cancelled. No explanation was provided. I was told to call to reschedule. The first time I called, I waited on hold for 15 minutes, never reached anyone, and finally hung up. The second time I called, I waited on hold for 10 minutes before finally reaching someone whose English was difficult to understand, and whose phoneline was filled by background noise. She told me that there were only two options for getting back to Los Angeles. I could either take a nonstop flight departing at 8pm and getting me in to Los Angeles late at night, or I could leave at 7am in the morning for Guadalajara, and then fly from there to Los Angeles. I chose the 7am option, which required me to get up at 3:30am to get to the airport in time. All in all, it was a terrible experience. I have never had a flight cancelled like this by any other airline, and then to have the only other options be a flight very early in the morning or late at night, and to not offer to compensate me was terrible. Not to mention the awful experience with calling the customer service phoneline. I will not be flying Volaris again.

### "online booking system is a nightmare"
Due to fly Volaris from Puerto Vallarta to Tijuana. The online booking system is a nightmare. Never functions correctly. I tried 3 times to book online. Phone customer service charges you more money than the online system. But the online system never works! The customer service staff are completely unhelpful. Will never fly with this company again. They hide extra charges everywhere. Your ticket price doubles and you don't know why.

### "Volaris will not refund us"
Chicago Midway to Durango. Purchased same day flight tickets at 10:30 am for 12:15 pm due to a death in the family in Mexico. We live an hour away from the airport and arrived at 11:20 and were not allowed to get on the plane. We were advised doors were closed early at 11:15. I tried to cancel and they stated "the policy is you have to arrive 3 hours before your flight". Again 4 tickets were purchased same day at 10:30, arrived at airport at 11:20, for 12:15 flight. My family sat there, the plane did not leave until 12:30. Volaris will not refund us due to "the policy". I explained this was an emergency, and I am devastated that such a big company can not refund due to the situation.

### "crew was friendly and efficient"
Leon/Guanajuato to Los Angeles. Online booking and check-in was easy, website was easy to navigate. This is a low-cost airline and we knew that when booking, so we did know what to expect. The baggage policy is unusual, one checked bag per person is free, but medium size cabin baggage is not. We paid USD12 upon booking for one cabin bag. In addition small items such as handbags and laptops are free. We found the rules clear and had no issues. The aircraft was new, built 2016, clean and in very good shape. The legroom was VERY cramped, so it was not a top comfortable 3hr flight. There is no entertainment system, and nothing onboard is free, even water carries a price. Some snacks and drinks are advertised in the menu card, but no advertised sandwiches were available, only peanuts and chips etc. The cabin crew was friendly and efficient, some spoke decent english. The flight departed and arrived on-time which we consider important. If one accepts the low-cost airline policy, this is very good product. It is easy to find better comfort/service using legacy carriers, if prepared to pay up.

### "the leg room was terrible"
Cancun to Tijuana via Mexico City. The only good thing is that Volaris planes are newer. But they didn't have sandwiches as they forgot to load them on a 3hr flight. No TV's, radio or entertainment. My husband is 6'  and the leg room was terrible for him. Aeromexico at least has IFE and they lend you headphones, and the leg room is way better.

### "I am so infuriated"
Denver to Guadalajara. I can't emphasize enough how utterly terrible Volaris was to me yesterday. I paid to bring my pet. I complied with their published policy which states clearly "the health certificate must have validity for at least 5 days" before travel. Her certificate had validity for 30 days. 30 is more than 5. Using the words "at least" means "at a minimum" not "at a maximum". The employees at the ticketing counter don't understand the definition of the words used in their policies and refused to give me a boarding pass. I was able to fly with the same certificate on a different airline the next day without issue, other than the fact I had to pay out of pocket for the new ticket. I am so infuriated I can hardly breathe. I paid for a ticket and they agreed to provide the service I paid for, given I met their conditions. I met their conditions. They stole my money.

### "airline is like a comedy show"
Never fly with Volaris. We travel globally regularly, this is our worst experience and the airline is like a comedy show. The flight from hell from San Francisco to Mexico City. 3 hours delay initially - on boarding they said 19 passengers that had waited over 3 hours didn't have seats, offered incentives to stay behind, that was accomplished and another hour. We boarded the plane then were told the weight is much for the plane 17 passengers will have to get off. They offered $900 complementary flights another time, with Volaris as incentive. Finally when there were 4 passengers still over the quota, last passengers to booked in were existed the plane. Shocking to experience, that took another hour, 5 hours late now - got to Mexico City no terminal free waited until they got staff to bring 2 buses to pick us up - the stairs to walk were loose and staff had to help some passengers out. Waited 2 hours for the baggage to get into the airport. Connecting flights were again missed. We arrived safely, that's a plus. We had to reorganise our plans. So many people had crying babies, children and so many missed connecting flights. Care factor for passengers nil from the airline. The mind boggles at how this airline meets the strict global requirements to operate.

### "still have not issued a refund"
I was supposed to take a round trip to Morelia from Chicago with Volaris. I arrived at the airport at 5am 2 hours before my flight and checked in my bags. I ended up paying $185 dollars for overweight luggage on both of my bags. I got a boarding pass and went through security down to the waiting area before boarding my flight. After a couple of hours waiting they announced that they had canceled the flight and directed all customers back to the customer service desk for further information. By the time I was waited on, the 2 clerks that were on duty were very worn down with all people's complaints and arguments since they did not have any other flights they were offering refunds. However, the Volaris employee at the airport could not give me a refund for the overweight luggage that I had just paid nor give my husband an immediate refund for the canceled flight so I could catch another flight as I had to be in Morelia the same day. Instead he gave me a phone number to call (Volaris customer service) and they would resolve the problem and issue a refund of all charges; in addition he gave me a code number for a $200 dollars bonus that I could use on a future flight (they offered the same thing to all passengers to make them calm down so they would just leave the service desk at that chaotic moment). My husband ended up booking a flight out of O'Hare airport to Guadalajara the same day. After many, many calls to Volaris they still have not issued a refund for the flight, the overweight charges and the $200 dollars bonus money that they offered, saying that the code they provided at the airport was invalid.

### "staff impressively efficient"
Mexico City to Tapachula. Given the fair number of negative reviews, I was a tad nervous about flying Volaris but the price was right. Takeoff was late by an hour or so due to the airport (a dozen other flights by various airlines got delayed as well). Airport staff were impressively efficient about getting me to the right queues and gates, including several individuals who spoke English. Seating was typical for a budget airline anywhere. No luxuries but everything clean, polite and okay in general. I don't doubt that problems occur with Volaris and that I was fortunate – still, I'd fly with them again.

### "poor service"
Cancun to San José with Volaris. They cancelled our flight (which they seem to do a lot reading other reviews). I called the airline to ask what to do next. They did not want to explain why my flight was cancelled and told me to be able to move it to 9 or 10 days later. I said that 9 or 10 days later is obviously too late and not a reasonable offer. I asked for a refund, which they refused. They wanted to cancel the ticket and keep the money without a reasonable solution. This is totally unacceptable which I of course told them. After getting angry they suddenly could offer me a flight the next morning. Please do not choose this airline. The risk that they cancel the flight is huge and you will have problems getting a good alternative. This makes the airline expensive rather than cheap, with poor service and lack of other advantages.

### "service is horrible"
Colima to Tijuana with Volaris. Service is horrible. Never will I nor my family will take this airline. Flight attendants are there to assist and to have pleasant flight not to just look pretty and greet you in. I know it's a budget low close airline but at least give free water and coffee complimentary as part of the service. I fly alot would rather pay that extra cost to fly with major airline like Areomexico or Alaska to fly to Mexico. So the best advice is to pay that extra $30 to $50 to get better service and comfort.

### "everything was good and on time"
Having read all the negative Reviews, I was a bit nervous before my flight from Monterrey to Puerto Vallarta with Volaris. The only issue I had was with the online check-in. There I could only assign seats which cost extra which was annoying. So we went to the "normal" check in counter at MTY, service was fast and they put me next to my girlfriend so everything was fine. The flight was on schedule and even arrived earlier in PTV (about 15 minutes). On the way back everything was good and on time. If you are used to European low cost carriers Volaris has about the same quality in terms of seating, service etc. Only the on-board lugagge is a bit smaller but you are allowed to check a small bag (~15kg I think). This is a low-cost airline (although from a European stand point the tickets are not that cheap), and as such it is really good (or at least my one experience was).

### "aircraft clean and comfortable"
Cancun to Aguascalientes with Volaris. A family trip from Cancun to my parent's home. Professional airport agents providing swift check-in and directions to gate. Boarding process a bit chaotic with some people on wheelchairs making their way through steep stairs to board the aircraft. Aircraft clean and comfortable. No inflight service - but prompt arrival to our destination. I fly Volaris as my last option because you basically have to plan for everything, including number of luggage pieces, along with their weight and dimension. This last one is always a favorite of this airline. If the length, by width, by height exceeds their specific size, you will be charged. This is how the low ticket prices becomes expensive very quickly, not to mention the disturbing experience of feeling nickel-and-dimed. Agents know this but I think their pay depends on their vigilant eye.

### "very pleased with the airline"
Flight Mexico to Denver. After reading the many negative reviews for Volaris I was concerned when I figured out it was the only airline that would fly direct to Denver. I had to fly my son (6 years old) by himself for the first time so he could study abroad. So I could feel more secure about the transaction, I traveled to the airport in Mexico City to purchase the ticket. With the unaccompanied minor fee it was a total of 9000 pesos aprox. They recommended to arrive 3 hours early on the day of departure. When we arrived at 7 am to check in and the ladies were very nice. They gave us the forms to fill out for customs and immigration and the release and deliverance for my son. We then proceeded to check the baggage where we handed them the forms plus the tourist FMM form we recieved when we entered the country along with the passport. They put everything in a bag like thing with a lanyard that they wear on the flight. They told us to return at 9 am sharp. I was beyond scared for him because I thought he was going be the only minor on the flight. When we returned there were about 14 other children that were also flying solo. It made me feel so relieved. They called out the names of each child for check in, then proceeded to security where we said our goodbyes and one by one recieved their lanyard to wear. They proceeded through security where we waited for their flight to leave. My son called me and said he was sitting down playing with his game and the plane was ready to leave. I tracked the plane until it arrived in Denver where my aunt was waiting for him. After the plane arrived he took about an hour in customs where the attendants from Volaris released him to my aunt after her signature. Once I called my son and asked him how the flight was and how he was treated, he said it was good and that they gave him chips and water and didn't even ask him for his 10 dollars (which I had given to him just in case). I am very pleased with the airline and hope to encounter the same experience when I fly with them.

### "dissatisfied and disappointed"
I will not use this airline again! My wife with my 2 little girls (6 & 2) were coming from Tapachula to Tijuana, scheduled to arrive in Mexico City, at 12:55pm. Volaris decides to change the flight from Mexico City to Tijuana from 3:47pm to 8:00am! That makes no sense at all. So now my wife and daughters were stuck in the airport hoping to get a flight any time during the day back to Tijuana. The agent on the phone said there was nothing he could do - he had the tenacity to tell me I should've called 24hrs prior to get a better option. There's no justifying reason for Volaris to have made that change in times, it makes no sense for them to give her a schedule she cannot keep up with. Very dissatisfied and disappointed.

### "breach of privacy and security"
Cancun to Mexico City. On Aug 9 I bought online, after much difficulty, 2 flights from Volaris, and received my confirmation code. But at the airport on Aug 11 it did not exist - they said it was a problem with my Visa, that it did not authenticate. So I was forced to buy a more expensive flight on the spot with my Mastercard. I had to threaten to scream at the airport, because they just kept telling me to go away from the check-in desk! It was a horrible experience, I had to be very stubborn (because I was desperate) and finally they agreed to give me a discount certificate for the price difference. They said the problem was with my Visa, that if it doesn't authenticate in 3 hours after purchase on Aug 9, the reservation code is not good and you don't get the email confirmation or a cancellation email. But actually, my Visa was charged, on Aug 10, and 3 times! On Aug 11, at the airport, there was no record of this or my original reservation code. I'm still waiting for Volaris to return my money, more than CAN$1000. More problems: I never got an email about the first or second (successful) flights, but now I get emails that are for other customers, every day! It is a breach of privacy and security. It is also spam. I have sent Volaris many messages about this, on Facebook and by email, to 3 different addresses.

### "pay or throw it to the trash"
Guadalajara to Tijuana. Terrible. I have a toddler flying with a car seat at 11pm, they told me I could not check It in for free at the bottom of the airplane when it clearly states on their website this is done without any additional feeds. I flew 4 times from Tijuana/Guadalajara/ Cancun back and forth within these two weeks, nobody said anything until our last flight coming back to Tijuana from Guadalajara. They were trying to charge us 1000 pesos in order for me to be able to add in on the bottom of the plane all because it had cup holders so they considered it too be non infant! Ridiculous! Extremely disappointed. They said pay or throw it to the trash. 3 rating for the service inside the airplane.

### "experiences were very positive"
My experiences were very positive. I traveled from Tijuana to La Paz and back in May 2016 and in April-May 2015. The planes were on time and the people were friendly. The seats were more spacious and more comfortable than the economy passenger seats in the US based airlines. One checked bag is figured into the ticket pricing. The above seat stowage of carry on bags was ample for good sized bags. Food could be purchased, which was not a problem for me. I was thoroughly pleased and will definitely travel with them again.

### "definitely not recommended"
Guadalajara to Los Angeles with Volaris. As I was arriving to the airport to return to Los Angeles I got a call from the airline saying my flight had been cancelled. I had driven 2 hours to get to the airport. They never once told me why my flight had been cancelled. They told me I had to speak with an agent at the Volaris desk. Once I got to the agent I was told the next available flight they would provide would be the following day in the afternoon. This to me was not possible so I had to buy another ticket to a different airport. If they are going to cancel a flight they should inform the passengers in a timely manner. Definitely not recommended.

### "total lack of respect"
Volaris traveler beware! You need to read the fine print in the Volaris legal section first. For an international travel you need to arrive at the Volaris counter 180 minutes before departure. On April 27th 2016 I arrived 60 minutes before departure at Chicago Midway to fly to Morelia, Mexico, and no one was present (see photo). I was not able to figure out how to print out my boarding pass from an email sent from Volaris. Therefore I had no means to get through TSA to the boarding gate, and had only a back pack as a carry on, so no baggage to check in, (I think). After reading numerous other Volaris customer complaints this might not be correct, as nearly any carry on is charged for. Bottom line is the flight left without me. Talking to Volaris employees on the phone they could care less (too bad, so sad), and I'm out the cost of this nontrip, time, and cost to park near Midway Airport for 6 days. Going to the Volaris website to make a complaint is a waste of time, as this airline does not have any means to so. Emailing two different email addresses that appear to be public relations contacts results in one email address that bounces, and the other will not reply. Bottom line, flying with Volaris read all the fine print and be prepared to pay extra for anything connected with the flying experience. I've flown internationally with other airlines to Europe, Asia, and Africa and never encountered the "180 minute prior to departure rule", or the unwillingness to communicate about an issue, or total lack of respect for the customer.

### "the service was terrible"
I had the worst experience coming home with Volaris recently from Cancun, Mexico to Newark, NJ. I arrived back Friday April 8 and from boarding to landing the service was terrible. I paid extra for front row seats on the plane and I wasn't accommodated for anything. The crew were rude and not polite. They didn't want to help at all. I will never fly with this airline again.

### "we did not have seats"
Mexico City to Mazatlan with Volaris. Stood in line for over an hour before they helped us. Then when we finally were helped, we gave them our flight information and they left the check in area. The clerk came back about 15 minutes later to tell us that they overbooked our flight and that we did not have seats. They told us that we never had seats on the plane, even though we had booked the flight and chosen seats months in advance.

### "has to be the worst airline"
Oakland to Guadalajara. This has to be the worst airline I have traveled with. The service is atrocious, not to mention the pricing tactics and overpriced "add-ons" they force you to pay for. I must admit their apparent low prices are very tempting and are what draw you in, however at the end of the day you end up paying way more and a few dollars isn't worth the stress they cause. I've flown on this airline on several routes out of many airports and the service is appalling. The crew have no regard for their paying customers and have no problem insulting you, pushing you around and coercing you into paying them more money. More than once, I gave in at the time I reserved and paid extra to bring a carry-on : only to be told I hadn't paid for it when I arrived at the airport with a printout showing I paid for it. They employees are unethical and have no problem coercing more money out of you or making up "extra fees" at the time of check-in. The flight attendants have no qualms about being rude to the passengers and condescending when you ask them a question even though they are usually the ones who can't comprehend what you are trying to explain to them. Imagine my surprise when I go to print a boarding pass for a flight tonight, and now their flight again magically doesn't include the carry-on? I'm sure when we arrive at the airport they will do their usual routine and try to coerce another $60 for two bags. Don't waste your time with this joke of a company.

### "service was fine"
Guadalajara to Tijuana with Volaris was a very nice and smooth flight. Little turbulence and banking. Service on the ground seemed enough to get you to the gate. Once boarding began it seemed as if I was rush hour with no control but in a controllable way. Service in the air was fine but just seemed routine without making you feel totally welcomed. For the price I paid it seemed fine because it was very low cost.

### "online service is horrible"
Guadalajara to Houston. Airport service was very slow. I paid extra for personal service and got none. I waited for about 35 minutes in line just like everyone else. The plane was ok and the staff OK, only food to buy which is fine. The seats are adequate. Nothing particularly good or bad except the price was a bit better than others. I wish there was direct flight competition as the online service is horrible. I can't get anything from anyone online and the mobile APP is absolutely worthless. I am very disappointed in the management of this airline as they fly what I want to use.

### "will not travel airline again"
Terrible Airline! We traveled from Mexico City to Los Angeles, included 1 checked bag, and 1 small (very small) personal bag in the airplane (purse size). Anything else at additional cost. Flight got delayed because the airline didn't have crew. We waited 1.5 hours for the crew to arrive. Airplane was old, all drinks and food at additional cost, This airline doesn't have designated gate in LAX. We had to get transferred in a shuttle to the terminal (not fun at 12 midnight). On our arrival to Los Angeles we waited for 2 hours to get our bags. Every 15 minutes we got 2-3 bags in the carrousel. Everyone was super frustrated!. Volaris staff didn't do anything about it and they didn't communicate to us the reason of this delay. I will not travel this airline again.

### "do not recommend this service"
Terrible service! I bought a Volaris service where an employee escorts my mother to the plane and takes care of her baggage because my mother suffers of blindness. This service was terrible because they forgot to escort my mother into the airplane and left her waiting until a gentleman who noticed the situation went and told the employees. Then the escort made my mother carry baggage that was not even hers. They treated her terribly and did not help her at all. I do not recommend this service to anyone!

### "best flying experience"
Chicago to Leon. Very clean airplane, friendly crew, lots of leg room, large cabin space for storage and nice snacks! Efficient and diligent staff. Volaris offers reasonable fares compared to several American carriers. My best flying experience!

### "poor customer service"
Our Volaris flight was delayed 12hrs. Stood in line for check in for 2hrs, where there prior the recommended time, when we arrived they said it was overbooked. False information about time and fishy rebookings to flights after that never showed up so more and more delays. No reliable information and service around the situation. Given you false hope 2hours at the time to avoid compensation. No structure and total chaos so people that waited shorter got flights earlier than you. Poorly handled from beginning to the end. I have never experienced such a poor customer service. Delays can happen but it's how you take care of your customers that matters. Would avoid this airline to any cause. You want to deal with professional people and feel safe and taken care of when these things happens. At least an honest answer regarding the departure so you could do something with the time.

### "carry-on issue is funny"
Portland to Cancun via Guadalajara. Before booking our family vacation, we read a lot of reviews since we didn't know Volaris. At first I thought these negative reviews were upset passengers being vindictive. Well, they were not wrong. The 'carry-on' issue is funny. You can check in 1 bag person for free and take a carry-on (or two can't recall) but a small roller bag is considered a 'carry-on' which they will charge you $45 each way! I will say the staff in Portland slipped us a free carry-on, some points for that. In Guadalajara we knew we can't a short window to our connecting so we were running. The staff in Guadalajara seemed incompetent and even write the wrong gate. As we ran thru security, we got to the gate, but no one was there - wrong gate. By the time we figured that out, our flight left to Cancun. Next flight? 5 hours later. The uncomfortable seats are squashed and combined with the lousy flight crew added to our frustration. Finally, if you don't speak Spanish you are at a great disadvantage because most announcements were in Spanish and no repeat in English (luckily we knew how to buckle our seat belts)! Sure, this is a discount airline, which they do advertise in a loud ear-piercing message upon landing, but come on, have a little dignity!! All in all, points to the Portland staff, but I guarantee after this trip we will never use Volaris again. Too bad we have to fly home with Volaris.

### "whatever they want to charge"
As others have mentioned, the Volaris charge for "carry on" is whatever they want to charge for whatever you may carry. It doesn't matter if it fits or is exactly the size listed on their web site. The web site is also something that a high school study could do better. Functions don't work. It loads very slowly. It looks "cheap". The extra fees are probably to pay for the extra flight attendants. Our flight had 5 going to Mexico and 4 on this flight to Orlando. After they ask if you want to buy something you don't see them again until they come by (maybe) to collect the trash. Both of our flights only half full. The seats were very uncomfortable.

### "where they can make money"
Horrible service at check in. Volaris charged me $50.00 for a carry on bag claiming it was bigger in size than what they allowed but I had this same bag for over 5 years and no other airline ever charged me extra in the past. I discussed with attendant to the point it became an argument and he never made the slightest attempt to be flexible. I didn't want to argue more so paid the fees but told him I would never fly with Volaris ever again - he had the nerve to say "never say never mister". I had an international flight and they offered no drinks at all. The cost for a soft drink was $1.60 US dollars. Their prices are normally lower when you but the ticket but they're constantly on the watch to see where they can make money from you.

### "offer absolutely no service"
Volaris has always been my airline of necessity because they have a direct, economical flight between Guadalajara and Chicago, I have been a regular customer for 5 years now. What started out as a convenient airline has become a nightmare every time I travel. They constantly change their rules about checked and carry-on luggage, charge you for a cup of water, offer absolutely no service or assistance to customers, and have novice stewardess working flights. Do not take any carry-on that has wheels - Volaris considers this to be luggage and will charge you for it. Carry-on must be soft with no wheels.

### "always changing flights"
Volaris may be very inexpensive, but they are really inconvenient. They're always changing flights and not just hours but days. I've traveled with them for more than 5 times and they have always rescheduled the flight. They're not reliable at all! And this last experience with them definitely has me thinking of never flying with them again. All the employees are just rude, including the call center employees. They are no help and want to charge extra fees for everything.

### "every single employee was downright rude"
I flew Volaris between Guadalajara and Los Angeles. I am an ex Flight Attendant with 20 years flying experience (another carrier) and always take keen interest on any new carrier. The flight was a flight - nothing more nothing less and definitely nothing special. What has prompted me to write is the fact that every single employee of this company that I had the misfortune to meet was downright rude and came with an attitude that would curdle cream. Passengers were treated like they were an inconvenience to the surly crew dashed thru the cabin selling their stale sandwiches. I went to the bathroom and as I came out one of them came into the fwd galley with a cart, scowls, tutts then motions me around with finger motions as if she's pointing out dirty marks on the carpet! I had been living in Mexico and was returning to Australia and know that Mexicans are not like those that I met on this airline.

### "no food available except for chips"
I have flown all over the world (including the same outbound flight on Volaris) with a carry on bag to carry my FAA approved oxygen concentrator. Today they demanded an additional $30.00 to take in on the plane. Horrible personnel at the check-in counter, with little or no idea of what they're doing, except charging additional fees. A porter at the airport told us that they have big problems keeping personnel, since most quit. There was no food available except for chips on either flight. Even if you have to pay, they should stock some kind of sandwich that you can buy.

### "staff in Guadalajara were rude"
This is the worst customer service I have received. Particularly the staff in Guadalajara, who were rude. I have flown with Volaris before from Leon to Chicago without any problems, but every time I fly from Guadalajara I have issues with the staff because they want to charge for the same carryon bag that I use with them on the flight there from Chicago. It's ridiculous. I even weigh my bag with a personal scale I bought to make sure I don't go over the weight but the scale in guadalajara is not accurate. My luggage weigh the same at the other airports as on my scale except for the scale in Guadalajara.

### "planes look a little dirty"
The second time I used Volaris. First time from Guadalajara to Los Angeles round trip, and this month a round trip Guadalajara to Fort Lauderdale. The space for the seat is really tight, they charge for the second baggage more than 100 USD. The Volaris planes look a little dirty.

### "trying to charge everything"
Very bad service with Volaris, they want to charge for the carry on, even if they fit perfect in the plane, only is to charge you more. Staff are rude and only are trying to charge everything. The seats are not comfortable.

### Volaris customer review
I only flight Volaris because I have no other choice. When buying tickets on line, the site tries to charge you more. They want to make you think that they have good prices and sales, but they charge a lot! They charge you $90 pesos if they print out the ticket. A reprint, they will charge the same. You have to go to an automated terminal and do it yourself. Luggage size policy is most ridiculous. If for some reason you take the same luggage that other airlines allow, they make you pay a fee of $400 pesos at the gate. If you tell them to check it in, they say in a very rude tone, that they cannot do it at the gate and you need to go outside security, make a line and check it in yourself. They confirm you that the plane will leave and they will not wait for you so you end up paying that amount or losing your flight. If the person in front of you reclines the seat, you are cramped and uncomfortable. Today they have a marketing strategy to get more clients by saying that you can reserve an entire row so that you can travel more comfortable. Flying Volaris is very frustrating.

### Volaris customer review
We have been flying them for several years, so much cheaper than the competition and great service. We generally fly from Tijuana airport to Puerto Vallarta. Cost is about 1/2 of what it would be out of San Diego and sometimes a lot less. At present they offer you a free checked bag up to 55 pounds and they allow 2 free carry-ons of a smaller size (fit under the seat) such as a purse or backpack. Only one time was the flight significantly delayed and that was due to weather. Easy website to use to check in (allows you to do so 72 hours early). I do not purchase a seat before I check in and have never had a problem getting a seat with companions. You can print your boarding pass at home or at the airport in a koisk for free. All planes we have been one have seemed new or newer, clean. Friendly flight staff. They have food and beverages for sale now (used to be complimentary). However, you know this so bring food yourself or buy theirs.

### Volaris customer review
Our family will not be flying with this airline again. Their flights are constantly off schedule. We had a terrible experience, which ruined our vacation. We were flying out of Tijuana to Cancun with a connecting flight in Mexico City. When we checked in they said our connection to Mexico City was late and they changed our connection which caused us to arrive late to our Cancun vacation. We had planned to arrive in Cancun early morning. We were very disappointed! We ended up traveling all day as opposed to just half a day just because our original connecting flight was late. In fact, most of the connecting flights we had with then during this vacation were off schedule. There was a lot of waiting around! This is pretty disappointing since this was our go to airline. However, we will now be shopping for another airline. Also, they offer no complimentary beverages or food/snack on board.

### Volaris customer review
Their website is a joke, call center is worse. I spent hours online trying to pay for an extra piece of luggage the day before I traveled. The website would not allow me to prepay it just kept taking me back to the home page. I tried calling the call center and got the same thing, a recorded message advertising all the additional services but no live person to talk to. I ended up having to pay at check-in and was made to pay $100.00 for one extra bag. When I voiced the issues with their website I was told I should have called the call center. Also, the live chat feature on their website does not work (big surprise). To add insult to injury, they said my carry on was too big and wanted me to pay another $100.00 to check that bag!! Same carry on I use at other airlines with no issues. I said forget it and asked them bring the bag I had just paid $100.00 to check, so that I could put my carry on items in that bag. I was told "that's not going to happen" even though I could still see my bag on the belt. At this point I threw a fit right there at the LAX counter. Thirty minutes later I was given back my bag. I am normally a very calm person but what made the whole experience so irritating was the rude and condescending attitude from the Volaris reps. Absolutely no attempt to try to make one feel better about being ripped off. Same thing happened with the website and call center when I tried to pay for the extra luggage on the return trip. This time I actually called another number as if I wanted to buy a new ticket and that's how I finally got a live representative on the phone. He was nice and was able to add the extra bag in advance. It still cost $65.00 for the extra bag but I guess it's better than $100.00. Total round trip cost LAX to Aguas Calientes = $545.00. I could have flown a First Class airline for that price.

I flew Volaris 901 17 April LAX-MEX and carried my allowed small luggage with me that perfectly fit on upper compartment and was on policy per Volaris/IATA regulations. On my return flight 926 MEX-LAX the check in personnel asked me to pay over 40.00 dollars if I wanted to carry the same small luggage. I told her I had just few in from LAX with that particular luggage and it was no problem it more than fit the regulations and there was no Policy stating I should pay. She told me they were having an "audit" and the finance personnel will be waiting at the entrance of the plane so I should pay her 40.00 or pay double at the entrance. I refused and of course there was nobody at the entrance "collecting: money. Now the problem is that other 6 passengers did pay to be allowed to carry their small luggage that perfectly fit the compartment and was within regulations. Some clients paid 80.00 USD others between 40.00-50.00 USD. am not the only one that decided to never again use Volaris.

I flew Sacramento to Guadalahara. The fare itself was not so cheap the round trip was around $565. To choose a seat I had to pay $13. Then at the gate even though the website says you can have a carry on bag they charged me $40 for the bag and no receipt. They don't even give you water for free. No one should be flying this poor excuse of an airline.

### Volaris customer review
LAX-GDL then GDL-MEX. Nice modern aircraft on both legs. Flights were cheap which is why we went via Guadalajara - which is a pleasant airport for a quick layover. Boarding system is among the strangest I've seen - each seat is assigned a group with which to board (1-4) but the group assignment seemed completely arbitrary and not related to place in the cabin as would be expected. Also they make you line up in your group rather than just call one group at a time felt like primary school. Legroom is absolutely horrendous. I'm 6'2 and my knees were banged up against the hard back of the seat in front even before it had reclined. Would have been somewhat forgivable had the seat back not been so hard. The seat itself is also quite uncomfortable. I'd actually say this is probably the worst airline seat I've sat in. Staff are expectedly inattentive for a low cost airline. They're also very inconsistent with their decision to translate from Spanish to English - some announcements are more important than others obviously? The lady next to me on one of the flights ordered the buy-on-board nachos which looked awful (canned cheese plus corn chips) so I didn't bother with any of that. No inflight entertainment to speak of outside their magazine. Would recommend avoiding Volaris if you value legroom.

### Volaris customer review
Mexico City (MEX) and La Paz (LAP). My flight was cancelled without reason. However I was able to rebooked another flight without any additional fees and got a free emergency exit seat. Very good service in the airport. Seats were comfy in a modern aircraft.

### Volaris customer review
I just flew from Bajio to Tijuana two days ago and my experience was negative. Low cost airline is false. They charge on separate basis for everything at a very high rate - ticket boarding pass snacks water luggage etc. Seat pitch is very tight so I couldn't work with my computer because I couldn't open it. Flight attendants are young without good people handling. The only good thing they are doing is the boarding procedure.

### Volaris customer review
I also was nervous about flying Volaris after reading the negative reviews. I have since flown them twice and will be making another flight in two weeks' time. Suffice it to say that I was more than pleasantly surprised at the quality and service of my trip. Delta Airlines which we always flew everywhere can't compete with these prices quality of service clean and new planes and helpful personnel on board. All my flights have either been spot on time or early. I give them very high marks.

### Volaris customer review
I was really nervous before my trip to Cancun. However my experience was great. We boarded on time staff were friendly and our departure/arrival process was smooth. I'm used to flying with Southwest and getting complimentary drinks/snacks for the flights so I was disappointed that wasn't the case with Volaris. But for the price I paid for my flight I can't say I was surprised either. To put my trip into perspective I booked a ticket in February to Cancun for Memorial Day week (6 days 5 nights from Thursday to Tuesday). Vacation hotspot for a holiday. After tax and travel insurance I only paid about $540 for a red eye flight. I had no issues in regards to the negative reviews I read very positive experience.

### Volaris customer review
Volaris puts other low cost airlines to shame. I've just moved to Mexico City from England and was a little nervous of using them for a trip to the coast having had past bad experiences with the likes of Ryanair and EasyJet. What a difference! Brand new beautifully clean planes with comfy leather seats highly efficient bi- lingual staff check-in and bag drop took 5 minutes no extra charges other than a light snack on board and an instant upgrade to the larger emergency exit seats due to my husband being a big unit. Not bad for £35 each. Yes people this is Mexico a country not known for great customer service.

### Volaris customer review
I had paid for a round-trip ticket with no stops from Tijuana to Cancun but when it came time to get on the flight it was a totally different story. Instead of getting straight to Cancun from Tijuana we had to have a layover in Mexico City for 2 hours on our way to Cancun and on our way back from Cancun. I had originally purchased my tickets ahead of time and specifically asked that it have no stops. When it came down to getting my tickets from the kiosk I saw that I had a layover. The company had changed my flight without my knowledge.

### Volaris customer review
Just completed a domestic round trip from Los Cabos to Mexico City. Starting out the flight was 5 hours late because of "weather in Guadalahara". On the way back a 2 hour delay no reasons given! They have your email address but don't bother to contact you. They try to sell you extra luggage options seat selection checking in at the counter 30 pesos ($2.60) per person extra leg room and god knows what. No free cookies pretzels nothing! A glass of water or a coffee is 25 pesos ($2.00). I bought a bottle of water at the airport but was afraid to ask for a plastic glass. Not a good experience!

### Volaris customer review
My flight from GDL to SJC was cancelled last minute without a reason. The agents were rude and took hours to try to reschedule me on another flight only to tell me they could not place me on a flight till 4 days later! A day before the flight I called to confirm and was told my new reservation was only from GDL to LAX not SJC. It took me hours to get them to secure me a flight for the remainder of the way. They secured a flight for me from LAX to SJ with a different airline because after 4 days they still could not accommodate me on one of their flights. To top it off the other airline charged me for my luggage which I had already paid with Volaris. A horrible experience.

### Volaris customer review
Flew ORD to MEX. The fare was incredibly cheap and after reading the other reviews I was prepared for the worst. In the event I found these things to be completely satisfactory: online check-in bag drop departure and arrival times seat comfort baggage collection time and email updates from the airline. However the inflight service was decidedly substandard. When handing out the migration forms the cabin attendant looked at us only to hand them out to other rows. Worse still was the refreshment situation. Typical with low cost carriers food and drink had to be purchased. What came as a surprise was that payment was limited to pesos in cash. Not having Mexican currency we endured the 4 hour flight without so much as a complimentary glass of water! Now that I know what to expect I would fly them again but only if the flight was cheap.

### Volaris customer review
We flew from SJC to GDL on Volaris flight 931 and from GDL to MEX on flight 743. Both flights delayed. First one almost two hours second one by more than three hours. Its normal to go through delays what is not normal is how this airline treat their clients. They don't provide accurate information and they keep delaying the flight by 20 min when they are well aware that the flight won't take off for hours. They forced us to stay by the gate without dinner and arriving to Mexico City 2.35am. Both their ground and air personnel have no clue how to provide an adequate service to their clients. If you have an option to fly with another carrier take another carrier. This is among the worst airline I have encountered.

### Volaris customer review
I have been living in Canada for 6 years and as every year I visit my family in Mexico City for the holidays. We decided to go to Puerto Vallarta this year. We purchased a ticket with this awful company 4 months before. The flight was moved from 9.30am to 5.45am 3 weeks before with no previous advice (no email no phone call no nothing). Of course all tickets were twice the price by that time with any other airline. They don't even apologize. We get to the plane the flight is late and they charge for everything in flight even a glass of water. Never flying with them again.

### Volaris customer review
Mexico City to Denver. Flight #982 December 10th 2013. By far the worst airline of all times! I am not the only one that this has happened to which is unbelievable. Here it is: if they don't have enough people to fill up an entire aircraft they will cancel the entire flight. And they only have 1 flight per day. My wife and my 1 year old daughter are stuck in Mexico City. No notice no refund nothing. Zero customer service!

### Volaris customer review
Mexico City to Cancun. They changed my flights without any notification. I happened to check my reservation online and found the change. They had no explanation for why I was not notified. The 6 other travelers in our party had the same problem. Offered me a 10% voucher on my next flight which will never happen. Much better options out there.

### Volaris customer review
I have been travelling on Volaris for the past two years. My latest trip from La Paz Mexico to Guadalajara Mexico on the 7th of November was terrible. The airline changed their baggage allowance in mid October and on their website they give carry on dimensions that are wrong. My bag was an inch higher than their metal box that the carry on has to fit even though I had done the measurements before leaving on the trip. I was charged the equivalent of $25.00. I had also booked and paid for emergency row seats and was told that I hadn't booked them. Then I realized that they had given us someone else's boarding cards. When I spoke with an agent I was given my appropriate boarding cards without any apology at all. When I arrived in Guadalajara I complained to three different people about the baggage and boarding card issues and was informed that there was no supervisor on duty even though this was one of their hubs. This is an excellent airline for inexpensive fares if one books at least 3 months in advance but it is a terrible airline for customer service.

### Volaris customer review
Used this airline from Chicago (MDW) to Mexico city and I have to say it was pretty cramped but as long as you avoid the aisle seat your good to go. I just wish Voris was also available in Houston TX. I recently moved and I am frustrated that Volaris doesn't offer flights in Houston.

### Volaris customer review
Unacceptable experience in May on an LAX to Guadalajara flight. Chose Volaris because they had the lowest price. However their strange new luggage policies negated any financial savings. You don't get to bring as many lbs onboard as with other airlines and they are incredibly strict about this requirement. We had 2 checked bags and 2 pieces of carry-on luggage which they insisted we re-balance until all 4 weighed exactly the same. They don't let you do this at the counter so you have to get out of line and open your bags in the back of the terminal move things around and then stand in line again. It took us 4 tries and 1.5 hours to actually check in the 2 bags and we barely had time to make it to the gate and board. Considering all 4 bags flew on the same airplane it obviously wasn't a question of excess weight. When I priced return trip tickets the additional baggage charges made their rates completely uncompetitive and low prices were the only reason we had for flying Volaris.

### Volaris customer review
SFO to Guadalajara. They had the best price for a direct flight. Next time I will take another airline with better service because in the end with all their extra and hidden charges you will end up paying a high price for a horrible service and horrible flight. planes are packed like sardines and when you arrive in Mexico they off board you at the tarp walking down a high flight of stairs from the plane all the time carrying your hand luggage and then they herd you like cattle onto a bus. Even though I paid extra for option to change my flight still they charged me an extra $200 dollars in fees and don't start me on the luggage allowance. Don't fly with this airline.

### Volaris customer review
LAX to Mexico City to Cancun round trip. Staff at LAX Mexico City and Cancun were very helpful and patient. FA's on each leg were kind and helpful. Boarding very fast and efficient and they boarded according to rows back to front. The seats were as comfortable as any other economy class airline. There is only economy class. The snacks were your choice of chips and drinks were free not just soda and juice but also beer and mix drinks. We were a party of 5 and we checked 5 bags and were all within the weight limit. Upon return 1 bag got left in Mexico City at Customs it was delivered to our home the following day. I was very sceptical about flying Volaris after reading so many negative reviews however when you are a family of 5 I had to go with the most economic. I will not hesitate to fly Volaris again.

### Volaris customer review
TIJUANA-MEX nearly 4 hour flight. At check in they charge for several things also for a 19k bag - they say they have a 15k policy. Boarding ok flight on time. FA's nice they serve snack and drinks for free. Arrival on time a little time waiting for bags.

### Volaris customer review
MEX-LAP-GDL-MTY. They can be cheap if you are not flying with a lot of luggage if you buy extra kilos the final price of your travel can double! Ground staff service is very basic you must print your boarding pass at home to avoid a 20 pesos fee the onboard service is very basic flights are mostly on time planes new but not too many options of entertainment a few audio channels you also need to bring your earplugs as they do not provide them. Bottom line - an ultra low cost carrier.

### Volaris customer review
On a flight from Mexico City (MEX) to Chicago (MDW) seats were not very comfortable and it was quite crammed. Flight was on-time. Baggage policy is only 15 kg per passenger for an international flight. Service on-board fine. Not a great low cost airline.

### Volaris customer review
I flew direct from Oakland CA to Mexico. The worst part about the entire situation is there is no assigned seating which I was unaware of. I called Southwest (who I booked it through) to get assigned seats and they told me I would have to pay for them. So I did because I wanted our family together. I realized the night before departure that I was the only one with assigned seats so I tried to call SW again and they routed me to Volaris. Their on ground customer service is horrible. Interestingly enough once we got on the plane it wasn't too bad - flight attendants were nice enough etc. I will not fly them again unless I am forced to.

### Volaris customer review
Just took my third return flight to Guadalajara Mexico on Volaris. Our most recent flight was LAS-GDL. Volaris makes no bones about being a low cost carrier but they do provide free cocktails and more than the normal number of snacks. Flight crew is well dressed and very attentive. They have recently revised baggage allowances but do offer fair pricing for additional baggage if you take the option when booking. Our only objection is the manner in which they physically search luggage prior to actual check in at the airport in Guadalajara. It is a tedious and time consuming process.

### Volaris customer review
MDW-GDL. The crew were always available and glad to assist female pilot was constantly making announcements of weather conditions on our route and reminding us to enjoy the flight. Being a 4 hour trip I was not surprised there was no food but the snacks offered were sufficient I even asked for a second round. The in flight entertainment was fine. Volaris is my airline of choice they always depart on time and usually arrive 10-15 minutes early to whatever the destination is. They constantly have very good promotions on their webpage. I recommend it.

### Volaris customer review
I just flew from MEX to LAS and I was very disappointed with the way Volaris has cramped additional rows of seats into its planes. If you are moderately tall you will suffer through the entire flight. There is absolutely no room for your legs let alone using your laptop. I don't understand who at Volaris made the decision to add these extra seats it used to be one of the most comfortable airlines in Mexico now it is an airline that I would try to avoid whenever possible. In addition and with no apparent real reason they have reduced to 15 the number of kg you can carry on your suitcase. If you exceed the limit they charge you US$8 per additional kg. Volaris has put all of its effort in becoming the most uncomfortable and least friendly airline in Mexico.

### Volaris customer review
I don't know what has happened to Volaris. Over the last 3 years they have gone from good to horrible. I started to fly LAX to UPN flights recently. The web-site is maddening when booking an international fight. Sometimes it works sometimes it won't or asks you to call customer service. Warning - weigh your bags before you check-in. If you're one pound over you get charged $50USD. The seat pitch is 28 inches or less. Even a 2 hour flight is uncomfortable because the seats recline too far. Each time I flew UPN they gave me the wrong customs forms. Everyone on all flights had to redo their customs documents! It might be a great place to work but they have young employees with poor training.

### Volaris customer review
Very good carrier. They offer best connectivity available to/from direct destinations at their Tijuana hub which I fly out most often. TIJ airport underwent a complete terminal renovation and expansion. One has to be careful Immigration services are before Customs when departing so make sure you get the tourist permit before checking in. I had printed my boarding pass online asked if I could check-in at the express counter and I did boarding is very simple: people with online-printed passes board first regardless of any other priority pass or so. Staff very nice overall service is good and they take pride on being very punctual (out of tens of flights I've taken only 1 has been delayed). They have a modern fleet and planes are neat. Entertainment wasn't bad though they keep airing the same shows from 6 months ago. When flying into TIJ always take your passport: both domestic and international arriving passengers go through passport control. Apparently the airport treats everyone as international passengers as I mentioned above both departing or arriving one has to undergo customs and passport control.

### Volaris customer review
Had to take an unplanned flight with 30 family members to ZAC (Zacatecas) from TIJ (Tijuana). Tijuana International Airport is very nice. Security is pretty stringent. They have a couple of check points with army officers. Check in was not the best but we made it on the plane on time. The plane was an A320. Clean. On- board staff nice. They handed out alcohol soda water and chips. The flight was smooth and arrived at ZAC on time. Check in on the return flight from ZAC to TIJ was not good. They apparently sell some sort of fast pass check in which delayed those that did not want to pay for that service by about an hour as they got first priority. We made it on a packed plane. Flight crew was great. Arrived on time. I would fly them again. They are very reasonably priced and offer great service.

### Volaris customer review
MEX to CUN. The behaviour of Volaris staff especially was the most disgusting I have experienced from any airline staff anywhere in the world. They deliberately placed me on the Volaris flight knowing full well the situation and consequences of that action. They knew full well I would miss my onward flight and that no arrangements were made for my onward journey. I was just passed on by them to Cancun despite their assurances and despite them knowing the consequences.

### Volaris customer review
Very good price! (254 USD for 4 flights on route Oakland-Mexico City-Cancun). Very nice new planes. They offer free luggage snacks drinks and alcohol. Very nice helpful cabin crew. One minus - they cancelled one of my flights and changed it for another one (without my approval) and then didn't inform me about it.

### Volaris customer review
Good pricing structure especially when ticket is purchased during their frequent promotions. Service overall is good especially onboard. Ground personnel leaves a lot to be desired especially at boarding when all announcements are made without the aid of a loud speaker and in Spanish only. There is no respect for anyone needing special assistance with prior boarding. Boarding is divided into 2 groups electronic check-in and boarding passes. Additionally depending on the airport higher numbers may be boarded through the rear of the aircraft through a different gate. More attention needs to be given by the gate crew to the client. Be aware that your carry on luggage may be taken from you and checked in without any rime or reason. Airplanes are clean and onboard simple and efficient. Seating is extremely tight. Don't bother opening the tray on the seat back. Their on time departure and arrival is very good. Volaris can be a good experience as long as travel is aware of the pitfalls.

### Volaris customer review
La Paz to Tijuana. They took our carry-ons at the door in La Paz telling us overhead bins were full and offered to check our bags into the hold. We boarded believing our carry-on bags were safe. However when we arrived in TJ our carry-on bags were not on the carousel. Volaris luggage office advised that our carry-ons were overweight and were still in La Paz. We would have to pay $1650 pesos for them to be sent to TJ. When we contacted Volaris the following day the best offered was to "reduce the fee to $1100.00 pesos and send carry-ons to San Diego International. We evaluated our options and concluded that we were going to have to pay the extortion demand. We strongly suggest you do not allow them to check-in your carry-ons.

### Volaris customer review
Tijuana to Guadalajara. TJ airport new and spotless. Check-in crew very friendly plane new and very comfortable. Offered two drinks rounds and snack services on a 2.5 hr flight. Crew friendly. Look forward to flying them again.

### Volaris customer review
TIJ-MEX-GDL-TIJ roundtrip. Volaris gives you 72 hours ahead of the flight for on-line check-in and boarding pass a great advantage. For some reason they've changed the seats on their planes from TIJ-MEX there was no leg room at all and the seats did not recline (they weren't broken they simply had no recline button). The most uncomfortable flight I have ever been on. A real change from the Volaris of a year ago which was always comfortable if not fancy. The same coming back (MEX-GDL-TIJ) passengers are wedged in making a 3 hour flight feel endless. Good price but if you're over five feet six inches tall do not fly Volaris!

### Volaris customer review
TIJ-OAX round trip. Check in at Tijuana airport was a nightmare both securing the tourist visa and airline check-in. Volaris had only 1 line for each of 5 outbound flights each station manned by only 1 agent. The agent handling check in for Oaxaca was so slow we nearly missed the flight. The plane was clean and comfortable the pilots and crew efficient friendly very professional and bi-lingual. Return flight was smooth from check-in to landing. Both flights departed and arrived on-time. Beverage service and packaged Mexican snacks were only food options. All baggage for our group of 6 arrived at both destinations with no damage.

### Volaris customer review
TIJ-MLM using the Volaris Shuttle Service from downtown San Diego. All Volaris staff were friendly and helpful. The aircraft was new with comfortable leather seats and just enough room for taller passengers. Staff served free drinks (even alcohol!) and a selection of chips - much better service than you'd expect given the price you paid for the flights. No delays on either inbound or outbound flight.

### Volaris customer review
PBC-CUN on a so called LC-carrier. A319 to Cancun we left on time no queue at check-in excellent service with drinks but only chips. Return again on time and the A319 was 2 weeks old. Helpful FA and good security feeling.
