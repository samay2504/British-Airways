### "Worst airline ever"
Not Verified |  Worst airline ever. My flight was supposed to take of at 10:00am then they pushed it to 12:00pm then they pushed it again to 10:00 pm and then delayed 2 hours and 45 minutes. I was with my two daughters and one is a toddler. Finally when we boarded the flight they refused to give us any snacks and and claim that there was turbulence.

### "I don't recommend this airline"
The worst airline in the world in terms of dealing. My husband and I traveled from Zanzibar to Entebbe and back on flight number UR334 from 1- 6 Sep 2024. I booked online seats with space in front of them because my husband has a broken leg and needs space to stretch it. The airline employees changed the seats and gave us other seats without explaining the reasons or even apologizing knowing that the seats we booked were given to healthy young passengers. They changed our reserved seats to other narrow one. The plane is very small, we can said; is nothing more than a luxury bus, its price is very expensive compared to the fare it covers and the services provided. It has no advantage other than that it is a direct flight from Zanzibar to Entebbe. I don't recommend traveling on this airline.

### "I have not received my refund"
Not Verified |  I bought a ticket with Uganda Airline and had a sudden change in plans. So I canceled the ticket less than 24hours after purchase. Under their policy, the ticket is refundable minus some penalty. After following their refund procedure, I have not even received an acknowledgment receipt of my request. I constantly called for 2 weeks with false promises. Up to-date, I have not received my refund. If you're an international, I would not recommend this airline. They lie and have the worst customer service I have ever seen.

### "very poor Customer service"
First of all, at Abuja, the flight was delayed by 3 hours, and we were left completely uninformed about what was happening. A flight that was scheduled to depart at 9:40 pm didn’t take off until 2 am. Then, upon arrival in Entebbe for our connection to Nairobi, we were told our connecting flight had already left and couldn't wait for us—despite us only being 30 minutes late. This makes it clear that customers are expected to accommodate the airline’s delays, but the airline won’t accommodate customers when needed. After waiting nearly 4 hours in Abuja, we still missed our connection and had to be pushed to a flight 6 hours away. I now understand why half of the plane was empty—people are learning from experience not to use this airline because of such very poor Customer service.

### "Worst airline ever"
Worst airline ever! Do not book, even if tempted by direct flight. Rather use other airlines. The flight was scheduled to leave at 11:45. It is now 00:11 hours and we are still sitting at the airport. No updates until passengers complained. Only at 22:30 they tell us a plane has left Entebbe to come and collect passengers. They knew since morning that their plane had a fault, yet choose to act 12 hours later!!! Do Not Book This Airline!! This rating is for the horrible communication and appealing flight delay. I don't know what the inside of this plane looks like to rate it.

### "they can't see my flight"
Not Verified |  My flight was cancelled and when I got to the check in counter they said they can't see my flight and it doesn't exist in there system. After going back and forth with them trying to see if I will pay them. They told be they finally saw my booking and it was hiding some where. They didn't communicate either with Airlink in South Africa about the disruption because I would miss my connecting flight to my destination. I tried talking to them and they said they don't have an answer for me. The front desk crew where so unprofessional just trying to get money. They told me to go and figure my self out after missing my connecting flight.

### “experience was very professional”
The whole experience was very professional. Flight was completely comfortable clean and the air crew were friendly and helpful. The flight was on time and the in flight service was just excellent for such a short flight.

### "it is totally pathetic"
Not Verified |  I booked a flexible ticket as was unsure if I would travel or not. In the end I could not fly and had to ask for a refund. I was told it will take 28 working days! It is an absolute farce. Any refund needs no more than 5 working days. I still have not received it and I get no responses to my latest emails. I expect it will come, but it is totally pathetic. I love being in Africa, just don't reinforce the stereotypes about the continent; be professional.

### "my luggage was left behind"
Not Verified |  I paid a very expensive ticket in economy premium and my luggage was left behind. Reaching entebbe I reported the case to cargo section and they promised to bring the bag next day. I waited for 4 days and no one was contacting me. I contacted given number many times and was off then later turned on and no one was picking. Later a lady picked but was too rude and hanged on the phone. Staffs there are acting unprofessional and I think they luck knowledge of customer care. I celebrated my daughter's birthday without her dressing attires which costed me much money. First time and disappointed and hope not to use same plane.

### "flights always get delayed"
Not Verified |  Pathetic airline, not only does flights always get delayed, I sat at the airport for 12 hours the first time but called to board multiple times and then sent back so can’t even try to sleep. You’re told to wait in the cafeteria for a meal voucher and when is a complete lie because they let you wait for hours and no meal voucher is ever given. Pathetic airline.

### "experience wasn’t that as I expected"
I used Uganda Airlines to travel to Dubai but the experience wasn’t that as I expected. Many customers don’t comply with rules on a plane, talking loudly, they change seat to seat, their hand language with plastic bags everywhere. The rest where fine, the crew, service, food, safe flight.

### "beautiful experience with Uganda Airlines"
It was my first time flying Uganda Airlines and I give credit to the pilot, team leader and some cabin crew members. Though we delayed at the airport in Dubai the pilot made sure will reach Entebbe as per ticket timings. The plane was so full which made last checking in hard coz it was so many people. It was a bit cold inside the plain that I had to ask for a blanket but the cabin crew replied in unprofessional manner which made me so annoyed and disappointed. I had to call another Cabin crew Mr. Muhammad who was extremely helpful. I got the blanket in 2 minutes. He was so polite and smiled. He kept checking if am ok which made me feel comfortable and well taken care of. The food and the rest well amazing. A high thanks to Mbowa for my whole beautiful experience with Uganda Airlines.

### "one of the worst days of my life"
I checked in for my flight electronically for my flight on Wednesday, Nov 30th. I arrived 3 hours early at Entebbe airport. I was told the flight was not checking in passengers yet so I waited in the waiting room. My flight appeared on the screen of flights but two hours passed and it still said "on time" instead of "check in". At this point, I get worried and went through check in any way in case there was a problem with the screen and it never changed. I went into the airport and could not find anyone from Uganda Airlines to check my baggage. I asked and some employees say I had to wait. I waited for 30 minutes until I get scared something is wrong and I was going to miss the flight. I was told to leave the airport and go to the UA office to ask what was happening. Once I got there, the employee told me my flight was moved to Friday Dec 2nd. I did not receive any notification with this information! I was allowed to check in on Wednesday! The screen in the airport had the flight there and it said "on time". I had nowhere to go, I was not offered accommodation for those two nights. I had no cash on me. It was a terrible experience. I spent 6 hours at the airport wasting my time - 3 waiting for the flight and another 3 trying to figure out what to do. I was crying in the airport and booked somewhere to stay until Wednesday, having to spend a significant amount on accommodations and food for those days. I remember a lot of months ago when I was choosing between this airline and another and I picked this one because it was cheaper. In the end, it ended up being more expensive and one of the worst days of my life.

### "disappointing and unprofessional"
I booked a flight for 8:00-9:15 am. At 6 am, we arrived at Nairobi Jomo kenyatta for checking in and we were told its not time for checking in. We were called to check in at 7:15. We have stood here till 8am for a flight at 8am. Airport staff told us, this flight never takes off at 8am. Its joined with the 10am flight. This is disappointing and unprofessional. Why not communicate an ever occurring incidence or scrap off the 8am flight.

### "a really pleasant experience"
Flying with Uganda Airlines was a really pleasant experience. The Bombardier CRJ900 was more than adequate for the task of flying from Dar es Salaam (Tanzania)to Entebbe (Uganda) and back. The aircraft was perfectly clean in both flights, and the cabin crew quite professional and kind. I especially appreciated the leg space available, far better than on most European economy class seats experienced. A snack was served during the 1.50 minutes flight, that included a chicken sandwich, a fruit juice, a small bottle of water and a banana. More than enough for a mid afternoon flight. Worth mentioning is the kind support that I received at Uganda Airlines office in Entebbe, when facing an administrative issue that could have badly affected my trip. Very effective personnel, who did more for me than it was their duty. Thumbs up!
