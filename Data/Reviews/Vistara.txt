### “attention to detail is evident”
Not Verified | Vistara stands out as a premium full-service carrier, offering a superior travel experience that consistently impresses. From check-in to landing, the attention to detail and customer focus is evident, making it one of the best choices for both domestic and international travel in India. The cabin crew is exceptionally professional, courteous, and attentive, ensuring passengers feel comfortable throughout the journey. The seating arrangement, especially in Premium Economy and Business Class, provides ample legroom and ergonomic comfort, ideal for long flights. The inflight entertainment options are diverse, catering to various preferences, and the complimentary meals are thoughtfully curated, offering both quality and variety. Punctuality is another area where Vistara excels, with flights often departing and arriving on time. Additionally, the check-in process is seamless, and the airline staff are well-trained to handle queries efficiently. The partnership with Singapore Airlines also adds a layer of credibility and enhances the overall experience. That said, Vistara’s ticket prices can be slightly higher than budget carriers, but the services provided justify the cost. For those who value comfort, reliability, and excellent service, Vistara is worth every penny. It’s an airline that truly redefines air travel in India with its commitment to quality and customer satisfaction.

### "I highly recommend Vistara "
I had a wonderful experience flying with Vistara Airlines recently, and I can’t praise their staff enough, especially Ankush and Manisha. From the moment I arrived at the airport, they made the entire check-in process incredibly smooth and stress-free. Ankush was welcoming and guided me through each step with such professionalism, making sure I had all the information I needed. His calm and friendly demeanor made a normally hectic process feel easy and seamless. Manisha was equally attentive, helping me with my questions and ensuring I felt comfortable with every detail of my journey. Their teamwork and dedication truly reflect Vistara’s commitment to exceptional service. Not only did they make the check-in experience smooth, but they also set a positive tone for the rest of my trip. The flight was equally enjoyable, with clean cabins, comfortable seating, and excellent in-flight service. Thank you, Vistara, and a special shoutout to Ankush and Manisha for going above and beyond to make my journey a pleasant one. I highly recommend Vistara Airlines for their superb staff and top-notch service!

### "It was very great flying"
It was very great flying in Vistara today, then any other Company I liked this because of several reasons like hospitality, Seat comfort, cabin staff service, food Etc. Keep it up.

### “I expect better”
I'm deeply disappointed with my recent experience with Vistara Airlines. My booking was unexpectedly canceled without my consent or any prior communication, allegedly due to a fraud alert from my bank. Despite my repeated requests for clarification and proof, Vistara has failed to provide a satisfactory explanation or address my concerns professionally. This lack of transparency and communication has caused significant inconvenience, both financially and in terms of time. A mere refund is not enough to compensate for the stress and trouble caused by this mishandling. I expect better from a reputed airline like Vistara, and I urge them to address such issues more responsibly in the future.

### Vistara customer review
Not Verified |  Vistara is overall good .The seats were comfortable the food was kind of okayish, staff service on point, inflight entertainment was okay. This my first time flying with Vistara and i am sure that i will be flying again with this airline. The ground service could have been more better than this, the bus took a little bit of time.

### "arrogant crew member"
Extremely impolite and ill mannered cabin crew. Instead of giving a reply to a simple question, an arrogant crew member got into an argument in the most insulting tone. Even his colleagues were visibly disturbed by his behaviour. Some people lack basic etiquettes and cannot be trusted with hospitality spaces. But does the airline care? Of course not.

### "really nice experience"
It was really nice experience, this was my first journey with Vistara. I am 6.2 feet height and still I was able to sit comfortably. They provided food also, after long time get food in Indian domestic flight was a good feel. Every days we used to get in jet and kingfisher airlines. It was a nice experience, now waiting for my connecting flight to Dubai.

### “on-board experience is a bit so-so”
The on-ground experience was great, very pleasant check-in experience, the Adani lounge has a separate section for Vistara Frequent Fliers and Business Class which is quite nice. The on-board experience is a bit so-so, the legroom in economy is fairly tight and feels less than Indigo. They have cut-down on the quantity of food in meals visibly in economy class. The IFE was good enough to keep oneself entertained and thankfully with the middle seat remaining empty, the flight was quite comfortable.

### "onboard experience was amazing"
A late night flight (10 pm) delayed by almost 45 minutes is not the most pleasant beginning to the journey, especially given the horrible Encalm Lounge in Delhi (dirty, crowded, rubbish food). However, the onboard experience was amazing, the A321 has lie-flat seats with large IFE screens (which is a treat, since I could sleep comfortably for over an hour in a less than 2 hour flight). The cabin crew were prompt, helpful and very attentive. Upto 4 food choices and a pretty good spread. The IFE screens were great and the entertainment catalog is good enough for a short domestic flight but would be a bit boring for a 4-5 hour or above flight. However, baggage claim experience was not the best, despite the baggage being priority tagged it arrived after 60-65% of the co-passengers in the flight had received their bags, and when you are running over an hour late, it was a bit frustrating.

### "Extremely disappointed"
I faced a helpless situation with Vistara. No staff present, no proper guidance provided, and so much time wasted. Even after trying to contact the staff, I had to wait for an unbearably long time, and they were not at all helpful. If the management was better, I wouldn't have missed my flight even after reaching 50 minutes before. I would strongly advise anyone to choose another airline where at least you receive proper guidance and don't have to wait for staff to show up. Very disheartened by the airline; this was a very, very bad experience. Extremely disappointed with Vistara.

### "the experience was wonderful"
Boarding time at Delhi T3 was at 5:45 but boarding was complete by 6:15 and flight took off at 6:45 rather than 6:30. The cabin crew onboard was attentive and caring, My seat was 5-A i was travelling with my family in premium economy . The food was superb and the quantity was more then sufficient. flight landed before time, the plane was in top-notch condition and inflight entertainment was working properly. Overall, the experience was wonderful!

### “cabin crew were warm and efficient”
The flight from Bengaluru to Mumbai was on-time and pleasant. The cabin crew were warm and efficient, the legroom was comfortable, one is truly going to miss Vistara once it merges with Air India. If there are a couple of areas of concern, it would be the food, the quantity was generous but tasteless. The other area would be that in seat selection, if they can point out the restricted recline seats during seat selection.

### "prefer not being served anything"
We were provided inflight meal they started from back of the plane and tray collection started from front of the plane i.e Row 7 where economy class starts. One crew begin from business and first ended up with just serving those six rows and few passengers of seventh row of economy within 6-8 minutes of food being served tray collection begin and meanwhile i was eating which felt very dehumanising she just pulled off the tray while i was eating and there was stuff left in tray. After my tray being taken away i had trash left and i pressed call button no-one came for 10 mins after that descent began and seatbelt signs were on and then lady arrives and askes me to close the tray. I asked her what about trash, I was told to put in seat pocket in front of me. I would prefer not being served anything rather than being treated like this. On time performance was good but i prefer ordering speciality meal as it gets served earlier.

### “I was thoroughly impressed”
I am writing to express my utmost satisfaction with the service provided by Mr. Neeraj and Ms. Nikita. Their dedication and excellent service have left a lasting impression on me and my family during our recent visit. I was thoroughly impressed by the professionalism and attentiveness.

### “Crew members very hospitable”
Probably one of the best for the route. Ground handling both at departure and transit at Delhi was more than good. Check in very quick. Food I would rate the best offered on this route. Crew members very hospitable. Flight smooth and on time.

### "my request was rejected"
I’ve been suffering from severe back pain and when I received a broken seat, and requested to be shifted to another seat, I was told that there are no other seats available. Since I was genuinely uncomfortable I walked around the aircraft to check if any other seats available. I saw multiple empty seats in the premium economy and requested to move there. I was refused by cabin crew and then even after requesting the inflight supervisor my request was rejected. This used to be my favourite airline but just so put off by this behaviour. Gone are the days of actually caring to or just trying to make your customer comfortable and happy.

### "experience has been excellent"
It’s my first round trip on Vistara Airline ever. I am happy to share the experience has been excellent all around. I normally fly exclusively on Singapore Airline, but Vistara is an excellent choice now for my India route.

### "not received compensation"
The flight was delayed by a day and the airline agreed to recompense hotel stays for one night. To recover compensation I witnessed appalling customer service. I still have not received compensation despite agreement from the airline to pay. The flight itself was great.

### "The flight wasn't bad"
The flight wasn't bad. Seat okay in refurbished cabin. Staff were welcoming in small cabin. Food was alright but limited. Entertainment limited for English speakers but survived the shortish flight. Not bad overall but returning to UK via Qatar.

### "Vistara flights were delayed or either cancelled"
I came to the gates at 6pm on April 1, 2024 for the 7:30pm flight. It’s April 2, 2024 and I’m still at the airport to board another flight as I’ve never seen such an irresponsible set of staff. It was a day when many Vistara flights were delayed or either cancelled. When they were not onboarding even after 7pm, when we asked the officer at the gate, he informed that the flight is delayed and will take off by 11:30pm. Till we asked, no updates were given by the Vistara staffs. The flight status was showing “on time” and “security” even at 8pm. The flight arranged dinner for us and by 11:50pm, we were on-boarded to the flight. But the flight didn’t take off even at 12:30am on April 2, 2024. When checked with the cabin crew, they informed that the captain of the flight parked the flight and went away. Now only first officer is available. And they are waiting for another captain to come and take the flight. The cabin crew also has been waiting since 6pm on April 1, 2024. Then the first officer (very helpful and gentle man) informed us that by 1:15am he will inform us the decision of the flight is going or getting cancelled. By 1:30am we were informed the flight is rescheduled to 5am. When we asked for confirmation that f the flight, they said they cannot confirm until 4am. Only then they can know if any captain can come and fly the plane to Kochi. So they de-boarded us from the plane and we were sent to the arrival area to reclaim our baggage. In the flight we were informed if we need a refund, it will be done at the arrival. When we reached the arrival, we came to know that no such information is given to the arrival. So we strongly asked for a cancellation and confirmation on refund. They were not willing to give the confirmation. I said I need the confirmation of refund. Finally the staff at the arrival got a WhatsApp message of my PNR full refund confirmation. I booked another Indigo flight to Kochi at 10:10am and I’m at the airport since yesterday 6pm. Just now while typing this message, I got a call from Vistara that the flight which was supposed to leave at 5am did not go yet and now they are ready to fly to Kochi. I asked what was the purpose of the call? They informed me the flight is only left with 6 passengers (it was almost a full flight) and if we are willing, they are ready to take us. I said no. Had they properly updated all passengers from time to time, they could have avoided this issue and such a hat-redness towards this airlines. I was supposed to reach my home at 10:30pm yesterday. Who will take responsibility of the stress and strain I went through?

### “airline does not respond at all”
I purchased tickets from Munich to Colombo for five people. In Munich, we checked in three suitcases for our entire family of five. Upon arrival in Colombo, Sri Lanka on 15 February 2024, it was discovered that not a single piece of luggage had been delivered. Two of the three suitcases were delivered to us after five days on February 20. The third suitcase was not delivered. On departure from Colombo on March 4th, I was informed at the Vistara counter that the suitcase was not found. While in Sri Lanka, they ignored all the emails sent asking about the luggage. The phone line is impossible to call. On the way back from Colombo to Munich, one of the three backpacks was not delivered again. Fortunately, they brought it home to us after a few days. However, the original baggage checked in on the way there remains lost. The airline does not respond at all to emails sent requesting compensation. Finally, they wrote yesterday: With reference to your email, we would like to inform you that as per the investigation the baggage was delivered to you. Hence, we are unable to assist you further. We again apologize for the delay of the baggage. We look forward to welcoming you on board in the future. Incredibly. Due to the approach to customers, I recommend avoiding this company.

### "A negative experience"
A negative experience with Vistara. Indian staff in Mumbai the worst between all airlines which I used. Our flight was from Frankfurt by Mumbai to Colombo (and return). In way to Mumbai connection was relatively short (3h) and Vistara staff informed us that I don’t need to go to immigration (stay in transit) and is not necessary start execution of my Visa promise (ETA) which was valid to day of arrive to Mumbai. After 2 weeks when we returned immigration office didn’t allowed us to leave the airport (connection was long – above 24 hours and Vistara not secured transit hotel). When Vistara staff was called from Immigration to offer service for customers staff of Vistara wanted to send us again to transit are promised us to arrange transit hotel, to organize meal, water etc. But procedure which used was clever, every 100-200 meters they sent us to another person, and last one – before secure control promised that up stairs will wait another Vistara representative who will help us. Upstairs was duty free area without any Vistara office/ desk. Without also possibility to return. We were left in the lurch and we lost our hotel reservation in Mumbai without any Vistara help, without any compensation. If are any problems not expect help and support from staff. Our luggage didn’t arrive from Mumbai and we got it only thanks Lufthansa support after 10 days.

### "the staff were amazing"
Not Verified |   Vistara were very welcoming to us on both fights. Their service was really good, the seats were really clean and tidy and the staff were amazing. Enjoyed the flight, staff were so polite

### "an amazing experience"
We had an amazing experience with Vistara Mumbai staff. While travelling with a 10 mo baby we unfortunately got late for the check in. Even though the check in had closed 10 minutes ago they understood our situation and escorted us till the gate to make sure we did not miss our flight! Special thanks to Manas and Aparna and the whole staff for being so supportive. Aparna helped us throughout till the gate and even made the ground staff at airport aware of the situation. We would missed the flight definitely had it not been for these awesome people! I would rate the airline 11/10 if I could!

### “a mistake indeed”
First time I ever book an international flight with Indian airline company (I'm flying across globe since 12years). That was a mistake indeed! Initially flight got cancelled by airline and i just accepted next day booking without any bargain. Later I had to cancel due to family circumstancess and since then my refund is stuck. Vistara is saying they refunded to my TA (booking.Com) and my TA saying they haven't. Finally, Vistara today accepted that they haven't processed it! all this took hell of follow-up e-mails, calls and so far no result. What a poor process Vistara has while world is moving towards industry 5.0! So don't book with Vistara (especially via TA) if you have fraction of chance to cancel it!

### “Worst service ever”
Not Verified | Worst service ever. I was flying with family and allotted separate seats on online check in. No options given to choose seats. Staff at the airport was not ready to listen or help. Ruined my family trip time. My previous experience with Vistara was not good either. They lost my check in bag. Its been 11 months still not found and I haven't been compensated for baggage lost. Wouldn't recommend this airline.

### "genuine smiles and positive attitude"
Kudos to the cabin crew on UK896 (IFS Rachna and her team) for their genuine smiles and positive attitude throughout the flight. Their cheerful demeanor created a welcoming atmosphere on board. The cabin crew's attention to detail was commendable. From keeping the cabin tidy to promptly responding to requests, their commitment to maintaining a high standard of service did not go unnoticed.

### "Extremely poor experience2
Extremely poor experience, no information on flight delay. Poor ground process management and flight experience not up to the mark.

### "fly again with this airline"
Its been a few years when I flew a lot in Asia, so flying this time to India with Vistara was a surprise: The check-in was swift, the service immaculate (especially the stewardess Eshey. The biggest surprise was the menu, an how delicious the different choices were done. Except from the nowadays still rubbery buns, we had Indian and Oriental menus with tastes, The only disappointment was that a plane as big as the 787 had to squeeze in a 3-3-3 arrangement in this class, when I expected 2-3-2. But - all in all - I would always fly again with this airline, provided the service remains that excellent.

### “future flights only by Vistara”
International experience on domestic flight! I wonder why I did not choose Vistara, ever before? Maybe because I always chose the lowest flight rates. But, the marginally higher rate gave me an opportunity to enjoy comfortable seat, watch a movie, play game, inclusive of delicious hot food and of course, timely arrival and departure. Thanks a lot Vistara! Wish you lot of success. Will ensure, future flights only by Vistara.

### "impeccable service delivery"
I recently had the pleasure of flying with Vistara, and I must say it was an exceptional experience from start to finish. The cabin crew, led by the remarkable team of Jibran, Nevil, and Anuradha, truly set Vistara apart as one of the best airlines in the industry. From the moment I stepped on board, the warmth and professionalism of the cabin crew were evident. Jibran's leadership was evident in the seamless coordination of the team, ensuring a smooth and enjoyable journey for all passengers. Their attention to detail and commitment to customer satisfaction were truly commendable. Nevil's friendly demeanor and proactive approach made the flight a delightful experience. He was attentive to passengers' needs, creating a welcoming atmosphere throughout the journey. Anuradha's dedication to service excellence was evident in her impeccable service delivery, making every passenger feel valued and well taken care of. The entire team, including the unsung heroes working in the background, contributed to making this flight stand out. The immaculate condition of the cabin, the punctuality of the flight, and the overall professionalism exhibited by the crew reflect Vistara's commitment to providing a top-notch travel experience. I look forward to future travels with Vistara, confident that I will continue to receive exceptional service.

### "happy about the wheelchair service"
Extremely happy about the wheelchair service given by Mr Singh, in spite of the first wheelchair guy leaving my wife at the boarding waiting area, this person with a smile took my wife till the airplane entrance, great service. The crew was par excellent in all manner, keep it up, i will be for sure traveling by air Vistara only.

### "the bassinet seats were already sold out"
Before booking the flight, I called customer care and asked whether we would be availed with the bassinet or not and we were informed that the bassinet seats are given to the parents on a first come first serve basis. Once check-in was enabled we were assigned with default seats and they were not next to the bassinet so we called the customer care again to confirm. We were instructed by the customer care person to not change the default allocated seats and asked us to reach 4 hours before departure time to the airport as bassinet seats can only be assigned to parents at the airport while boarding. So we did as instructed and reached Paris airport before 4 hours departure but to our surprise all the bassinet seats were already sold out. As per ground staff there are 2 bassinets in economy out of which one bassinet is taken by a parent and other seat next to bassinet is assigned to a lady travelling alone. Ground staff assured us that they will make a request to the lady and ask her to swap the seat with one of us so we can have the bassinet for our daughter. When boarding was about to start (same ground staff present who said they will make the request) we reminded again to the staff but as per them the lady was still not there so we were again asked to go ahead and they will make a request once she will board the flight and we again trusted them. Now once we boarded the flight , the crew in flight said they can not request someone to give their seats to us and it's no longer possible to have the bassinet seat. The best thing we found in this entire scenario is that none of the bassinet seats were assigned to parents. All those seats were sold to individuals (we were lied by the ground staff saying that its given to a parent but all three person sitting were individuals and not even travelling together as a family) who paid for extra leg space so my question is why are those seats called bassinet seats at all and you even say it to parents that those seats are designed for parents travelling with kids and can be only given to the parents on first come first basis when this is not at all followed by your staff or your system anywhere? We requested multiple times from the customer care to let us choose those seats beforehand and we were even ready to pay for the charge also? Even after doing this much followup a simple thing can not be done by your staff then am not sure how you are operating this big airline. We would have happily travelled with our daughter without bassinet if those seats were given to other parents with higher needs but those seats were assigned to individuals with no kids while others were just struggling with their kids.

### "highly recommend this airline"
Not Verified |  The experience was just wow, right from the luggage check-in counter till the flight. Staffs are professional and ready to assist without any hesitation. Siddhant the flight attendant was exceptional, professional and ready to help promptly with a smile. Thanks for making my journey comfortable and memorable. it was my first fly with Vistara airlines and will not be the last. Will for sure highly recommend this airline. Great job keep it up.

### Vistara customer review
Not Verified |  Now TATA has a Monopoly with control over Vistara and Air India, it’s miserable for passengers. We have business class ticket from BOM-VNS-BOM. Waiting at VNS airport. Flight delayed by several hours. No one to talk to. No lounge access no offer of food or drinks. Only on the video monitors we see flight getting more and more delayed. We have to collect our luggage at BOM airport and manually carry the bags to Swissair, we may not have enough time. There’s no thru checkins.

### "served with utmost warmth"
It was a breeze from issuing a boarding pass (also a seat of choice) to being seated and served with utmost warmth. Classy Crew full of zest zing and zeal. Ms. Jasmine deserves a special mention - the way she went about settling pax on board and serving in a plea sent infectious manner.

### "good flight in economy on Vistara"
Not Verified |  Overall, a good flight in economy on Vistara. The IFE was good, the food and drinks were good and the in-flight service was warm and professional. However, the check-in process was not as per expectations despite access to the priority check-in due to the loyalty program. The staff at the counters were taking a lot of time to check-in individual passengers in the priority lane. If I had to wait in the regular economy queue, I would have missed my flight. Separately a little disappointed that on a previous review of a sub-par experience on my flight from Male to Mumbai in Premium Economy, Vistara's ORM team commented asking for booking details, it has been 10 days since I responded on email and there has not even been an automated acknowledgement of the email forget any action and I have been a CV Gold member for a couple of years now. The ORM team's job cannot be just posting a templated message.

### "experience has left a lasting negative impression"
My journey involved a flight from Bangalore to Delhi and a connecting flight from Delhi to Kathmandu on a premium economy of Vistara. Unfortunately, the initial flight from Bangalore experienced a half-hour delay, which caused concern as I had a tight connection in Delhi to catch my Vistara flight to Kathmandu. Upon arrival in Delhi, I immediately proceeded to the International transfer office to seek assistance. Regrettably, the Vistara staff informed me that I would not be able to catch my connecting flight. They mentioned they could provide an alternative, and I suggested two possible options: Royal Nepal Airlines A330 and Air India A319/20. However, the staff working there insisted that no alternatives were available and informed me that I had to stay in Delhi for a day. When I requested accommodation, the Vistara staff provided the name of a hotel called "Saptagiri. Concerned about the poor reviews of this hotel on Google Maps, I asked for a better alternative. I was directed to speak with a senior staff member who wore an Air India identity card. This individual was incredibly rude and unhelpful, insisting that I had no choice but to stay at the designated hotel. His behavior was both dominating and frustrating. Upon arriving at the suggested hotel, I found it to be in a deplorable condition, far worse than expected. To my shock, the hotel owner informed me that Vistara Airways had only allocated Rs. 400 per guest for food, which was wholly inadequate. I eventually managed to return via Vistara Air on the 17th, but this entire experience has left a lasting negative impression. I regret to say that I will no longer consider Vistara Airways for my future travels.

### "disappointed on the return flight"
Not Verified |  After a fantastic flight from Mumbai to Male on Vistara Premium Economy, I was a bit disappointed on the return flight with the food and crew service. The crew was just not as attentive. The only choice offered was between a veg and non-veg meal. I opted for the non-veg option but the food was not very good, unfortunately I was super hungry by that time. The crew offered beer which was warm and had lost all its fizz. Boarding and onboarding experience were fine, seats quite comfy and the IFE has enough to keep you entertained. Hopefully Vistara standardises the softer parts of the on-board passenger experience to align with the good hard product.

### "overall a great experience"
Not Verified |  This was my first international flight with Vistara and overall a great experience. The crew was attentive, menus were offered with options of 4 main courses and even the drinks were refreshed on a short 2.5 hour flight. The Premium Economy seats are quite comfortable and offer lots of legroom. The Vistara IFE has also improved quite a bit and there are enough options to keep you entertained. Overall very impressed with the flight and would look forward to flying a longer international route with them in the future.

### "$70 for a slightly larger carry on"
They charged me $70 for having a slightly larger carry on from Cochin to Delhi. The customer service is slow and they are unprofessional in the way they handle extra charges.

### "I was completely dissatisfied"
I always judge a company on how they handle changes to normal procedure. Vistara 100% fails. I first tried to change my ticket to different date. I tried online and my booking disappeared. I called and was left on hold for over an hour before I gave up. I then tried to cancel my reservation. The service representative simply hung up on me. So, I used the ticket. The airline staff are some of the rudest people in the world. What happened to customer service? The flight was fine. The breakfast was inedible, except for the bread. For lunch there was a Thai dish offered but there was none left by the time the attendant got to me. I had some nonveg chicken dish. It was terrible. One hundred percent inedible. All in all I was completely dissatisfied with Vistara for this trip. A couple of important lessons I learned. First, there's no advantage in flying economy premium. Second, Vistara is fine if you have extremely low expectations and don't try to change anything or deal with customer service. In the future, every time I see the advertisement that Vistara is the best airline in India, I'll probably laugh out loud.

### "She was extremely hospitable"
I was on a Vistara flight UK874 from HYD to BOM, and one air hostess Jugnu has been one of the most kindest and genuine air hostess I’ve come across. She was extremely hospitable and just talking to her ensure us a pleasant flight.

### "Very bad experience"
I booked a ticket for 2 from Bangalore to Chandigarh on a single PNR but they allotted us separate middle seats. When I requested them to allot seats together as we are traveling on a single PNR, they simply refused and rather demanded extra money if we need seats together. Very bad experience.

### "expect better from a reputed airline"
They make sure all the seats are under the charged category where you get no option to choose your seats except all the middle seats. With the family of four that option wasn’t feasible. In fact they auto selected the last row which has no Legroom and no recline. It was a tortuous journey where front seat reclines to the max and we have no place to breathe. Why don’t respective authorities seat and experience what oft feels to travel on the last seat. The fact well known than why sell these seats. We expect better from a reputed airline.

### "all the best wishes to Vistara"
We had a very soothing experience at the check in counter at Srinagar airport. Mr Nayeem helped us thoroughly in very comfortable manner at the desk. We really wish all the best wishes to Vistara and its team.

### "Terrible service customer service"
Stay away pay extra and book a more reputable flight airway. Terrible service customer service is a borderline comedy act with no real acceptance of the poor experience on the customer's end. What to expect from Vistara: delayed baggage (by 3 hours) on arrival and then a staff member threatening to remove you from the airline for having a piece of slightly overweight baggage without any form of assistance or actually providing a solution. Then on top of that the pure ridicule of the customer service we've had to deal with after is what you get from Vistara. I implore you after reading this review to please use another service and be better off, it may cost more but for your own sanity, health and wellbeing choose another airline.

### "Onboard service was outstanding"
Goa Dabolim to Mumbai in Business Class. Our aircraft was equipped with comfortable flatbed seats for the short flight. Onboard service was outstanding. However it took almost an hour for our bags to be loaded onto the carousel. While such delays may be out of the airline's control, the fact that there was neither an announcement nor any staff available to update status reflects poorly on Vistara. Instead of giving a full 10 rating, I will deduct a couple of points for this reason.

### "very good service"
When I’m check in from Kochin the counter staff Mr Sabarinath was so nice and kind. Inflight and connection from Mumbai they did perfect timing and very good service. Me and my family very happy traveling with Vistara and suggesting for everyone.

### "took it from me saying that it's dangerous"
I am traveling and my only way to work out is using my resistance band that I carry along, they took it from me saying that it's dangerous. I have travelled with it internationally many times without any issue and I travel very often.

### "Refund us and do the right thing"
If should you change the date of your flight you could end up paying twice just as we have. £290.45 is what we are owed since 16th March 2023, despite repeated attempts to get a refund, 9th March we call Vistara air and change our return flight to 16th March, 10th March Vistara email and ask us to upgrade the 16th March flight. 16th March arrive at the airport and we are not booked on the flight, the check in staff tried their best to resolve the issue but couldn't, we had no option but to pay for new seats, assured that we would be refunded. Since then I have passed on all the documents and information at least 10 times to Vistara via direct email, twitter. They initially insisted we hadn't been charged the second time, but I have bank statements to prove we have then they said that we were not entitled to a refund as we took the flights, we know we did, but we paid twice for them Vistara. Refund us and do the right thing

### "gave access to lounge for 2 hours"
Not Verified |  Service at airport was horrible and they only gave access to lounge for 2 hours when connecting flight wait is 8 hours. Staff at the airport lacks knowledge and business ticket means nothing to them.

### "Service was really bad"
Service was really bad. Food was very bad. They indeed provided the inflight entertainment which one can use in our mobiles but that was not working at all. Air hostess name (Mareena) said in Apple (safari Browser) this type of problems generally comes. They were also lying about the weather. My overall experience was very bad.

### "service was truly excellent"
Not Verified |  It was overall an excellent experience, and the service was truly excellent. For example even though it was barely an 1.30 hour journey a whole lunch meal was provided which was of the highest quality and taste and further my grandmother request of fasting which resulted to her being unable to eat the meal provided was dealt in a very wonderful and professional manner with the crew even providing fruits and juice instead. The actual flight was also very smooth and pleasant and there were no delays and we made it on time.

### "neat & tidy cabin"
Not Verified | Vistara is India's only FSC which offers premium economy seats on selected domestic routes. Recently I flew on Vistara from Coimbatore to Mumbai, my observation is they have neat & tidy cabin, some staffs had smiling face and some don't have any cheer in their face, food was below average, lavatories were clean, IFE can be used in personal devices and was great. Overall a good flight, except that the food taste and selection has to be improved. Soon this airline is going to be merged with Air India, hence hope things will change in the long run.

### "customer retention is not a priority"
International Travelers flying to India with a Domestic connecting flight beware of the misleading luggage allowance and terrible customer service of this Airline. Flew into Mumbai, on a long and exhausting international flight. (Those of you that make these long haul journeys know exactly how I feel) Was booked on a connecting flight to Bengaluru. The check in at Mumbai Airport started with the Business Class and Premium Economy check in counters being roped off. I had to wait to be noticed to be let in. International flights let you check in two bags with a weight allowance of fifty pounds each. International connecting travellers are given the same allowance provided their connecting flight is within forty eight hours of the initial journey for the Domestic sector. I was charged nine thousand rupees extra baggage fees for a two and and a half thousand rupee flight. I asked for the Station Manager was told there are four of them assigned but unavailable. I was not the only victim of this extra baggage fee scam, there were several other international travellers that were facing this unfair extortion. My first service experience with this Airline has been incompetent, unpleasant, unaccommodating and rude, which I was forced to pay extra for. Not something any tired long haul International traveler should have to experience, least of all pay extra for. I sincerely hope that my sharing this unfortunate experience helps you avoid it. Fair, accommodating, competent customer service, "brand loyalty" or "customer retention" is not a priority here.

### "staff cheerful, professional and warm"
UK857 evening flight 9.30 pm from Mumbai to Bengaluru was the finest due to Vistara staff who were cheerful, professional and warm. Felt good keep it up Vistara and wishing you all the best.

### "Onboard service was excellent"
Bombay to Dabolim, Goa on A321 in Business Class. Vistara is the best premium domestic airline in India today. Our aircraft was brand new and fitted with flatbed seats in Business Class (I reckon this aircraft is meant for international destinations with longer flight times). Onboard service was excellent and the overall flight experience was pleasant.

### "Overall a fantastic experience"
Not Verified |  Overall a fantastic experience with Vistara though the flight was delayed by half hour. The check-in was smooth and quick, the in-air experience was fantastic, there was a wide selection of meals and desserts on offer. The Vistara A321 is perhaps the only flight in which you can experience lie flat seats and a nice big IFE screen in domestic flights within India. The service was prompt and pleasant. Just a few things which could add to the experience - a wider selection of content would be needed for international routes, the content on offer was great for a domestic hop but thin in case the same selection is offered for an international flight. The Encalm lounge in Delhi is a improvement over the previous lounge but still not comparable to the one in Mumbai. I ended up leaving immediately and preferred to use the Amex Lounge over this.

### "Worst experience"
Not Verified |  Worst experience and that’s with a premium ticket, don’t ever fly with Vistara, they lost my luggage and no updates since 3 days now. They are really useless, inefficient staff working and least bothered. The transit experience from Mumbai was total chaos.

### "happy to be back in the air"
Vistara has for some time been the benchmark in Indian aviation with amazing service and attentive staff. Unfortunately due to personal issues, I was unable to fly for the last 4 months of so and was happy to be back in the air for a trip to Delhi on Vistara. I blocked the first row of economy class since the fare difference between economy and premium economy was quite high for the travel date. While the ground experience remains consistently good pre and post boarding. the in-air experience in economy has been quite degraded. For a morning 6 am flight, Vistara did not offer tea/coffee in economy class. The breakfast was very poor and my omelette was inedible. No condiments except a small roll and butter on offer. Now coming to the Club Vistara program. I called up Vistara, 2 weeks prior to my flight, as I had 2 Upgrade vouchers and wanted to use one and asked them to recommend a flight on which I could use my upgrade voucher (any flight and ok with either Eco to Prem Eco or Prem Eco to Business) and I was told that no upgrades available even 2 weeks before flying. Imagine my surprise that i could see at least 2-3 empty seats in premium economy in the flight i was traveling in.

### "utterly awful experience"
It was an utterly awful experience from start to finish. I fly this route a lot, usually with Emirates or Qatar and had read some good things so thought I’d try out Vistara business class. The fun started at boarding in Dhaka where there was no business priority and an approx. hour queue to clear security in to the gate where three separate flights were taking off from. Dhaka is an old airport with security at the gates but other airlines manage it just fine. There was only one Vistara employee checking boarding cards and when I asked him about Business priority and told him I would miss the flight he just shrugged and walked off. I only made the flight by taking my life in my hands and queue jumping, nearly causing a riot in the process. The flight Dhaka to Delhi is Premium economy not business - the seat is even labelled as such. Transfer at Delhi very odd - despite having a boarding pass I was escorted to the transfer desk to be given another one. I couldn’t access the WiFi as I hadn’t been sent the code I apparently needed (and no one on board has any). And then having paid $20 for it; it cut off halfway through (despite being advertised as ‘whole flight’) and I had to pay again! And then to cap it off, on arrival at Heathrow the business class bags came off last rather than first, which felt like a good summation of the whole experience. Never again.

### "Great experience"
Great experience! Vistara crew were super friendly and also helped me get back my travel accessory when I left it in the flight. Special mention to Mr. Anil Hegde, who went out of his way to help me get back my travel accessory in the midnight! Great team work

### "better options are available"
Not what is expected of a full-service airline that isn't cheap. Decent leg room is the only thing we could compliment about. Very rude cabin staff, running out of food options and delayed flights are just some of the pain points. No Wi-Fi option or infotainment system available. Not recommended when cheaper and better options are available.

### "first preference would be Vistara"
I was traveling from Dubai to Ahmedabad connecting Mumbai airport. On Mumbai airport my bag was damaged, I forgot my luggage on arrival waiting lounge and went directly to Vistara desk where Ms. Pooja helped me a lot I really appreciate it because I was extremely tired on that moment but she really made transition very swift & easy. My first preference would be Vistara.

### "thanks for the good service"
Not Verified |  As I am a tall person it was a bit uncomfortable for me and hence there was no option for legroom but compared to other flights I have seen, my experience was also quite good. I hope you will increase the flights from Delhi to Raipur. It was helpful to me after, thanks for the good service.

### "appreciate these kind efforts"
I recently took a trip to Srinagar and on my way back lost my phone at the airport just a while before the boarding. I panicked to find my phone everywhere which was noted by one of the Vistara airport staff named tabasshum who without any questions helped us look for our phone. Another of the airport staff member Suhaib also helped us a lot to find our phone. Both of these members helped us incredibly and sent us our phone back to Mumbai within 24hrs. They were constantly in touch with us till we got our phone and helped us with all the formalities procedures to get the phone. We are very grateful to to both Vistara airlines and specially grateful to these to staff members Suhaib and Tabasshum from Srinagar airport. We really appreciate these kind efforts. And wish to fly again with vistara airlines.

### "a wonderful experience"
It was a wonderful experience flying with VISTARA. The staff are cordial, patient and extremely helpful. They serve well, the food options are top notch and the announcements loud and clear. There is plenty of leg space and the seats are comfortable. The ground are very supportive and help out whenever necessary. I had an international transfer with a transit window of less than an hour in a huge airport. But the transition was seamless thanks to the ground staff of VISTARA. And of course, in a matter of a week, I had four flights, all of which were on time, and I landed ahead of schedule every time.

### "service given was excellent"
Not Verified | My wife and I (who are both 76) travelled yesterday from Amritsar to New Delhi on the 10.15 flight no. 694. The service given to us was excellent and we would particularly like to commend the staff onboard and on check in.

### "treat you like a valued customer"
Quickly becoming one of my favourite airline to travel with, Vistara treat you like a valued customer. The seat has an adjustable headrest, we were given free headphones for the IFE, a small meal was provided, all on a flight of under an hour! Also left on time and arrived early

### "Worst experience I have ever had"
Not Verified |  Vistara has given a worst experience of travel during my journey from Ahmedabad to Mumbai on 19 the March 2023. After their confirmation regarding the extra baggage added in the PNR, they didn't allow me to board without charge of extra luggage. It was a hot discussion at the Ahmedabad airport and they treated me with totally rude behaviour and wasted 3 hours at the airport. They don't know the meaning of humbleness and the fact came out that there is not synchronization between their team. Customer team response totally disagreed by their airport team. Since last 35 days, I'm sending chasers to them but received 2 emails that to with incomplete information and denied to give the refund. Worst experience I have ever had in my life for this flight. Highly not recommended. I'm ready to share the further proof if there is a need.

### "thank the staff of Vistara"
I'd always heard good things about Vistara but never quite understood why and so I couldn't wait for my first flight with Vistara. Not only was the entire journey comfortable with the smoothest landing but I want to especially highlight the service at the checkin counter at Mumbai T2 airport. I'd got the flight timings mixed up and there was a delay at my end admittedly, panic ensued but the staff at Mumbai airport were patient and managed to allow me to board the flight to Kochi. Words can't express my gratitude to Yash, Dolly and especially Sohail sir - a man of few words but your kindness left a huge impact on me. In a sea of horror stories of domestic Indian flights, I want to thank the staff of Vistara for setting an example and keeping the customer at the heart of what you do. Will be singing Vistara's praises for a long time!

### "extra for Premium is not really worth it"
The seats in the premium economy are in 3-3-3 arrangements compared to the 3-2-3 in the older version of the aircraft. The seat space is similar to the economy with a little more leg space. Paying extra for the Premium is not really worth it. Sometimes the premium economy seats are cheaper only go for it, when this option is available. No wifi on-board on this aircraft, TV sets can't be tilted. If the person sitting in front of you reclines his/her seat you can switch off your screen and plan something else to do. It's the first time to see the newer version of the aircraft is worse than the older one they were using.

### "Excellent food, kind staff"
I travelled from Delhi To London with Vistara direct flight in September 2022 on Boeing 787-9. Seats were quite good and comfortable. The inflight experience is also good. The food was excellent for economy class. All the covid policies has been followed by Vistara crew . In short this company is really number one. Excellent food, kind staff, good seats, clean toilet No complaining. Worth the money. Will fly again with Vistara soon.

### "service and food are relatively decent"
I was informed at the check in counter that there would be a half hour delay, and as I approached to the boarding gate, I was informed that there would be another half hour delay. Because of the delay, I had to reschedule my next travel. The flight took off 1 hour 38 minutes late. The inflight service and food are relatively decent. Seats are quite uncomfortable.

### "our worst flight experience"
On 7th March we had a flight which was Vistara from Srinagar to Del at 15.40 hrs which would land at 16.55 hrs and Del to Goa at 18.40 hrs. Our flight from Srinagar to Delhi departed at 16.00hrs and landed at 17.30hrs by the time the aircraft could dock the bay area it was 17.50hrs. Even though Delhi airport is huge we managed to get to the security gate and got through security at 18.15hrs. Even though we knew we were getting delayed for our next flight ran to the boarding gate which was also quite far from the security area . When we reached there it was 18.30hrs and boarding gates were closed. I am well aware that once boarding gates are closed they aren't opened but since it was their flight which was delayed they and since we had already crossed security check they should have given us a call which wasn't done. Their staff didn't have any empathy towards us. When we went to collect the baggage they made us wait for 2hrs. This was our worst flight experience

### "Very disappointing customer management"
I booked Business Class for my route from Delhi to Chennai for my wife and me (2 tickets). At check-in, the ground staff informed me that, due to aircraft change, there are no Business seats and that we are downgraded to Economy. Until now, after numerous contact with Customer Care, I did not get any indemnification, voucher or other as a compensation. Very disappointing customer management.

### "Vistara is seriously lacking"
Not Verified | We were planning to fly on Premium Economy from Kolkata to Udaipur via Delhi. Due to delays on Vistara, the flight did not land in time to make the connecting flight to Udaipur - even though we were assured on the flight over to Delhi by the staff onboard that since the delay was about 40 min, the connecting flight would wait for the 20 passengers to Udaipur. At Delhi airport, the Vistara ground staff told us that the connecting flight had departed and that they were trying to figure out what to do. We were asked to reclaim our suitcases in Delhi and told that we would be booked on an Indigo flight that was due to leave in 3 hours time. No other information was provided for almost 2 hours, and we were repeatedly told when enquiring that the "seniors officers", who did not appear once in front of us were working on the issue. With less than 1 hour to go, we were handed printed paper tickets on 8x11 sheets with random passenger's barcodes on both side of the sheets of paper and told to make our way to Terminal 1. We now had to pair up with random passengers and travel together so that we could go through security at the other terminal. Nobody escorted. the group of 20 to Terminal 1, which is 20+ minutes by a shuttle bus that weaves through the city traffic to Terminal 1 from Terminal 3. We got to terminal 1 with 2 minutes before they closed baggage intake. As a premium economy passenger, the baggage allowance is 30 Kg on Vistara, and we were assured by the ground staff that the baggage allowance would be honored as Vistara had called ahead to Indigo. To our surprise, Indigo told us that no such calls were placed and that we had to pay for any excess baggage above the standard 15 Kgs. We had to shell out INR 8250 (over $100) for excess baggage just so that we could get on the flight. When I called Vistara to rectify the situation, I was placed on hold for 25 min and eventually the line was cut off. On the 2nd call, after a 15 minute conversation I was told that they could not do anything for me and that I have to return to the Vistara counter where the Indigo ticket was issued to argue my case in Delhi. When I asked to speak to a "senior", I was told that they would reach out to me in 1 to 2 hours. The calls never came. I am thoroughly disappointed with the service. My attempts to rectify the situation with Vistara was essentially ignored. While in-flight service is good, when things go wrong and when service and understanding is needed the most, Vistara is seriously lacking.

### "definitely fly again with Vistara"
Flight attendants were extremely helpful, they helped us consolidate our weight and also helped us fly without any bags. Both of them help. Thank u so much Poonam. I will definitely fly again with Vistara and also recommend to others.

### "comfortable and a nice experience"
Not Verified |  I would thoroughly recommend Vistara. We had excellent an excellent check in experience at Amritsar and flights. At Amritsar, Dominic and his supervisor helped us redistribute our baggage in order to avoid paying baggage excess charges. Thank you. We had a very tight stop over before catching the flight to Goa. The ground staff at Delhi helped us through security to ensure we arrived at the gate on time. Thank you. The flights were comfortable and a nice experience. Thank you.

### "I am extremely impressed by their work"
We boarded at Trivandrum airport. Flight attendants were extremely helpful, they helped us consolidate our weight and also helped us fly without any bags. Both of them helped with my husband to get him a wheelchair and also kept on asking if he needs a doctor, as my husband was not feeling well. I am extremely impressed by their work and very thankful to both of them and others who kept helping throughout our flight. I will definitely fly again with Vistara and also recommend to others.

### "very good experience with Vistara"
Not Verified |  So we had a connection flight from Mumbai to Delhi. It was very good experience with Vistara my First domestic flight. Crew members also very nice. I like breakfast, after 6 months return from abroad feels like home made. Thank you Vistara it was very nice journey.

### "Great experience"
Not Verified |  Great experience. The cabin crew, Food, Seat comfort, Wifi all the things were great. Glad to have a safe journey with Vistara. Satisfied with the journey.

### "crew friendly and resourceful"
Early morning unplanned departure for Delhi to Mumbai, Got a good deal for the last moment price. Clean Cabin , seats, crew friendly and resourceful. New Aircraft so not much noise in the cabin. Basic Breakfast was served with a pretty satisfying with some hot drinks. Service was quick hence could catch a nice power nap as well. Did not try the entertainment system but will surely do it next time .

### "Super impressed with the service"
Not Verified |  Best domestic airline I have flown with in India. New and clean aircrafts. Amazing crew members. My flight was only 1 hour 15 minutes, and the airline served full meal course and drinks, which is very unlikely these days. All my flights were on time. Super impressed with the service. Highly recommended. They provide wifi to watch movies while onboard, amazing.

### "one of the great airlines"
Booked on 7am flight to Delhi on 12th jan. Flight got cancelled in previous day due to technical snag and i could not notice the message send. I have reached the boarding gates and then realized and staff informed me that no seats on next Delhi flights and full refund for the ticket can be made. Found that all other airline flights also going full. Airline staff offered later 9.45am flight, which will not meet my requirement. While i was trying to find a solution to reach Delhi at early, suddenly met Mr Vinod came out with idea of trying on 8am flight of Vistara as a standby and made me wait till gate closing time then board the flight. It was a great great relief. I should thank Vistara team for such wonderful support and especially Mr Vinod George. Vistara is one of the great airlines and wish them all the Best.

### "cabin crew were courteous"
I didn't have check in baggage so no check in experience. Boarding experience was  totally mismanaged, no queue, no sequential boarding. Seats are better that LCC. Working IFE system and had good collection of movies. Meal served was good, cabin crew were courteous. Departed on little late and reached Delhi 15 min late. Overall mix experience.

### "totally loved the flight service"
Service was amazing. Experienced business class service even in the economy class. Well maintained and clean flight. Spacious and the lighting and music were a great mood lifter. We were also surprised to have received free meal. We totally loved the flight service.

### "ground staff is so rude and ignorant"
Not Verified | You cannot label front economy seats as Premium Economy. These are 3:3:3 layout Economy seats with no additional comfort. You just cannot change the global definition of any class for your profits. Route: FRA to DEL. On top of this your ground staff is so rude and ignorant that they won’t accommodate any requests no matter how serious.

### "Another flawless flight"
Another flawless flight from Goa to Bombay in Business Class. Vistara does everything right for the premium class, from check-in to boarding to inflight service. I rate it as the best full-service domestic airline currently operating in India. The experience could be enhanced further by offering WiFi in the aircraft.

### "the finest premium experience"
Bombay to Goa in Business Class in an A320. Vistara currently provides the finest premium experience in India. The entire experience was flawless. Comfortable seats, warm service. There is no WiFi on this route but given the short flight time it is not an issue.

### "experience was extremely disappointing"
The worst airline I have ever flown with. I booked and paid a premium for seating in row seven. Online check in allocated the three of us row 25. I emailed Vistara three days prior to our departure explaining that when checking in online we had been allocated the incorrect seats. No response was received. Airport check in staff either couldn’t or wouldn’t correct the obvious error and didn't seem care even though one person in our group had mobility issues. There response was that they were only responsible for checking in and it wasn’t their problem. So now I have to fill out paperwork to claim a refund for the seating I booked and paid for which was allocated to someone else. Also the people in row 24 were totally ignorant of normal polite inflight protocol and reclined their seats which affected the person in our group with the mobility issue. We asked them to be not recline their seats but all to no avail. Eventually after a vocal exchange with these people a flight attendant moved them to different seats. The whole experience was extremely disappointing and very unprofessional.

### "Good experience"
Good experience of early morning flight, smooth on time boarding. Seats are ok, better than LCC in India, staff were courteous. God breakfast served along with tea/coffee, arrived on time.

### "return flight was considerably better"
Not Verified | Mumbai to Singapore a mediocre experience. Vistara doesn't have early bag drop in Mumbai. When I landed in Singapore, I found that two wheels of my suitcase were damaged. Vistara's rep said that wear and tear would not be compensated, which I accepted. The repair man I took it to noticed a large gash on body, and said I should replace the bag. On both sectors my food quality and quantity were lacking. Outbound sector was an overnight flight at 0145hrs, Breakfast comprised of an omelette, chicken sausage, and something else. Return lunch was a bowl of curry with chicken,  vegetable and rice. A salad started the meal and a small rasmalai for dessert. Lie flat seats in a 2x2 layout in the narrow body aircraft, with little privacy. There's not much time to sleep so its not a major issue. I wasn't impressed by the crew on the outgoing flight, perhaps because of the time of day. I felt that they were trying to rush things, but the return flight was considerably better. Internet on board voucher given did not work.

### "Good experience"
Good experience, on time departure and arrival, courteous staff, good food, clean and hygienic cabin, comfortable seats. No in flight entertainment system ,they offer Vistara world which can be used in personal mobile/tab/laptop using flight wifi.

### "Service was good"
Currently only Vistara offers premium economy in Indian domestic sector. Price is slightly above economy but worth for that. 1st 4 rows after business class is premium economy, seat pitch are good, comfortable than any airline except business class. Priority check in and boarding for premium economy passengers. First they served cold towels which was a pleasant starting. Though it doesn't Matter much but they shared a menu for the flight. Food was good for a domestic flight. Service was good. Flight departed and arrived on time.

### "the experience was amazing"
Not Verified |  This is not the first time I have flown Vistara, and the experience was amazing. The Check-In was pretty quick. On board service was excellent and the staff was polite. The flight was on time. In spite of a short flight, they still served good snacks. The seat was also better than most airlines I have flown, and the plane was clean and hygienic. I will fly with them again.

### "Overall a good experience"
Good experience, early morning flight from Mumbai to Delhi. Good boarding experience, aircraft was clean and fresh, so was toilets. Seats are relatively comfortable. Good breakfast was served on the way. They don't offers IFE screens but have a wifi based entertainment system which can be used in our personal equipment like smartphones, Tab or Laptops. Cabin crew were courteous. Overall a good experience

### "Good experience"
Good experience, returning back same day from Mumbai. Aircraft was clean and fresh, light snack was provided which can be improved, on time departure and arrival

### "overall good experience"
Better experience this time from Ahmedabad after I complained about my last flight boarding experience at Ahmedabad. Was an early morning flight, boarding was better. Aircraft was clean and fresh, a light snack was provided which can be improved, On time departure and arrival, overall good experience.

### "I would definitely recommend it"
Not Verified |  I would definitely recommend it. The staff are very polite and speak excellent Hindi and English. Some innovative ways to introduce safety announcements before the flight. The food is delicious and authentic. There is plenty of entertainment from both Hollywood and Bollywood as well. The only thing I would improve is that for tall people like myself, there isn't a lot of leg room. Otherwise, everything is excellent.

### "nothing to complain"
Ok experience, on time departure and arrival, okay meal on board, clean cabin, nothing to complain. Meal can be improved.

### "Not a good experience"
Boarding process at Ahmedabad was total disaster, the ground staff didn't had any clue what they are doing. There were total chaos, business, premium economy and economy ,no one knows where to be in queue, even after complaining the staff were not accepting their mistakes. My snack provided in flight was stale, when complained to cabin staff they just ignored and with few passengers they were rude too. Not a good experience.

### "A really professional service"
I recently flew Vistara business class from Kolkata to Delhi, connecting to my international flight on Air Canada to Boston. The whole experience was positive. The check in process was smooth. My luggage was checked all the way to Boston without any fuss. The lounge in Kolkata was quite good. The plane left on time. The service on board was excellent. The staff took care to make sure I was comfortable. The meal service for such a short flight was very good. A really professional service all around. I will fly them again.

### "had to shift weight from my hand baggage"
My ticket was with Air France and Air France uses Vistara as a codeshare partner for the flight from COK to DEL. Air Vistara doesn't honour weight limitations. I ended up paying 150$ as against stated policy of 100$ for baggage up to 32 KGs. I had to shift weight from my hand baggage as Vistara only allowed 7 Kgs vs 12KGs that allowed by Air France. It was a very disappointing experience to start an international trip like this. Would not recommend Vistara for travel within India.

### "soft product was found to be wanting"
I cannot fault the hard product, modern clean and well maintained aircraft but the soft product was found to be wanting. The crew seemed to go about their job in a robotic nature, no smile, no pleasantries, and the service was very disjointed. The food was a big let down and expected much better. It was bland, poor quality and mine was inedible.

### "a very pleasant experience"
Very punctual on time flight even though we departed almost 15-20 minutes late due to previous flight from our gate departed very late. The boarding of more than 100 pax was completed in almost 20 minutes which is in my opinion very efficient. Inflight service was very good with good quality of food with both veg and non veg option which is included in the fare. Condition of the cabin, seat and overall aircraft was up to date. The inflight entertainment was also good. Overall a very pleasant experience flying with Vistara.

### "a completely wonderful experience"
Mumbai to Bangalore. Wonderful service right from booking tickets to boarding to landing - a completely wonderful experience thankyou for such a great venture!

### "don't travel on Vistara"
London to Kochi via Delhi. Unless you have money to waste or want to be treated like a freeloader don't travel on Vistara. The staff both on ground and in flight treat the passengers like they are travelling for free. There is absolutely no respect given. On top of this the operations are terrible to say the least. The gates at Heathrow were announced 15 minutes before the gates closed. Considering the size of the airport it was highly inconvenient. The flights neither take of nor land in time. Our fight was supposed to depart from Delhi airport at 15:55 as per their boarding pass. But they called us to check our baggage for something at around 1545 even though the luggage was cleared at Heathrow airport and Delhi customs. They made us wait for absolutely no reason for almost half an hour. We had to run back to the boarding gate so that we don't miss our flight. For the price we pay the service is pathetic to say the least. The staff who are hardly exist around the airport are so arrogant and rude. I would rather walk for a day or 2 than fly in a one hour flight of Vistara.

### "It was a joke"
Not Verified | Delhi to Ahmedabad. I was flying back from US on Lufthansa and had connection of Vistara from Delhi to Ahmedabad. Everything seemed perfect, the staff was helping and aircraft was superb, but when my luggage arrived my two wheels of my Samsonite bag were damaged. One was damaged and the other one was totally missing, the staff at airport was so polite and offer me charges of Rs150. It was a joke. Everyone knows how much full size Samsonite bag costs. It was better if they denied to pay. I had a flight of 30 hrs and was so tired that I left the airport after giving a very good smile to airport staff. Didn’t expected this from TATA.

### "I am dreading my flight back to London"
Not Verified |  I flew Vistara for the first time internationally. My experience right from conversations with customer service in London until my arrival in Poona suggests that there is a serious culture problem with the airline. I tried to check in online 5 times and called customer service for assistance. It was clear that the online check in needs more sophistication so I politely asked if they would take feedback to help improve it. The response was “no one has ever had such a problem”. The tone and response smacked of apathy and lack of professionalism. I have wide ranging experience with many airlines and customer service but haven’t experienced this as far as I can remember. On the plane, the stewardesses were robotic and cold, not to mention uninformed. The flight was late taking off from London. Thinking ahead about my connecting flight I asked if we could have the customs forms. These girls did not understand what I was asking and when I explained again they said there was no such form required. Arriving in Delhi, there was no ground staff to assist many of us who had connecting flights. To top it, many us who had priority and transfer tags in our bags waited 55 minutes for our bags. There was no ground staff to help. All of us missed our connecting flight due to the bags being egregiously delayed. I arrived in Pune in 24 hours. Vistara how can you compete in today’s customer centric world with such an apathetic attitude and deplorable service. I am dreading my flight back to London. Never again will I fly Vistara.

### "accidentally booked 15 kgs of extra Luggage"
Had a bad pre-flight experience with the airline, I had accidentally booked 15 kgs of extra Luggage instead of 10 KG. I contacted Vistara customer care to reduce my extra Luggage to 10 KG and refund the rest as airline points so as that I can use it in my return flight to Delhi after a month. I offered to make an additional 10kg purchase of luggage along with this carryover 5KG right away, but they refused to help me out. These requests were made 6 hrs prior to my first flight here from Auckland.

### "Fly with Vistara, they are the best"
I didn't expect anything else or special from Vistara. In fact I was a little apprehensive as I had never heard of them before, but I should not have. My experience was made good by the generosity and kindness of the crew. Nothing was too much of a trouble. Despite the fact that they work so hard to look after so many passengers the smiles and pleasantries never stopped. My row of economy class passengers from London to Delhi (UK0018) was looked after by Rajeev and Tanya. Such genuine, polite and hard working people. She was a lovely host and probably the best airline crew I came across in a long while. Thank you Rajeev and Tanya" and rest of the team. Fly with Vistara, they are the best, a very human and pleasant experience.

### "I loved the experience flying Vistara"
Not Verified |  I loved the experience flying Vistara. I was really happy to get the breakfast and the amazing service by the crew. Vistara has taken full care of your entertainment as they have provided onboard wifi service. I would like to thank Mr. Priya Ranjan and other crew members for their amazing service.

### "Got me to the check in counter in time"
Not Verified |  Flight was delayed due to weather conditions I had a connecting flight to Melbourne with in 2 hours of arrival at Delhi. Staff had organised a ground staff to assist me and he did a great job. Got me to the check in counter in time. Thank you.

### "interested in blame deflection"
When things go well with this airline, you get a value-for-money and pretty comfortable experience while getting to wherever you're going. The hard product is  pretty good (newish aircraft, and good seat options esp. on the A321neo) and the flight and cabin crew are easily among the best I've flown with so far. When things fall apart, such as technical issues, Ground Ops at DEL is unable to plan ahead or communicate effectively. Despite having the three hours the flight was delayed to start making plans and arrangements, while 2 men worked, the other 3 men at the DEL transfer desk were either folding their arms or looking concerned, refusing to answer any questions while a dozen or so pax from a severely delayed incoming flight are either rushing for their connection or were simply brushed away without being given the basic accommodation. Customer Care is only interested in blame deflection rather than feedback, repeating statements about technical issues and safety when the feedback was not about the technical delay at all.

### "Very poor website for check-in"
Very poor website for check-in. Allowed one passenger for check-in but the other passenger was not allowed. The e-ticket number is the same. Still a problem. Not a user friendly website. No help from the customer care except telling us to go to the check in desk.

### "very helpful and informative"
Delhi to Hyderabad. I had too much additional luggage with me and was really worried about carrying it to the final destination, but staff were very helpful and informative. She not only communicated well and resolved the issue but also had understood what the passengers go thru. Looked forward to fly with Vistara and would also love to recommend the airlines to my family and friends

### "really help a lot to get it clear"
I was coming from USA and having connecting flight to Lucknow. At the time of baggage checking the staff Shakshi helped me a lot as there was one bag extra and I have already paid for that, but somehow it’s was not showing in their website. This girl really help a lot to get it clear.

### "service was excellent and consistent"
Not Verified |  I've flown this airline in same class before and knew what I can expect. Happy to notice that airline has hold it's standard and imparts superior product among all Indian and many EU carriers. Service excellence, catering and safety are few important points I noticed, where Vistara really plays the ball well. On both the sectors, service was excellent and consistent as well as catering. The entire cabin crew are eager at work and does all they could to serve the best. Polite, courteous, warm-heart, smartly dressed and professional crew reflecting Indian culture! The catering is among the best. Do not miss the desserts. A catch I noticed is AVOD should be updated with new movies and series urgently. The selection has to be more vivid, broader and up-to-date. After one flight, one can easily run out of options. While on-board product is excellent, where Vistara can really improve is ground customer service. Now for the third time, I got differing information in comparison to representatives on airport. The ground staff is divided on procedures and info. This can be make or break deal because it's not reliable. Cabin crew should keep up the excellent work. A superior product does cost a little more but Vistara is doing it's best and she does reflect her heritage inherited from elder sister in Singapore.

### "crew members are amazingly well mannered"
I had a flight today at 6:50pm from Bangalore to Delhi and reached the boarding pass counter after long queue outside the airport and managed to be there by 5:51 pm. I had boarding pass in my hand just wanted to submit my luggage. I asked 3 staff member of Vistara team if I am too late and every one said Mam you will catch the flight. But one staff was rude, he just didn’t want to even listen. Clearly telling me you can’t means can’t and I literally begged them and made them understood if I leave my luggage and rush to the gate I will be able to catch the flight. But it was clear that even if your staff was trying he simply wanted to be rude. I begged every staff member who were kind enough and have a logical reply to rush to the gate and leave my luggage and by 6:25 I was in the aircraft and even after me 3 more people boarded. Your crew members are amazingly well mannered but that guy wasn’t. rest of the staff was super kind . Thanks

### "Flight was good and staff excellent"
Not Verified |  We flew premium economy and this was our first flight with Vistara. Flight was good and staff excellent. Having paid a little extra for premium economy I expected to give a glass of prosecco or champagne but received a small glass of water or orange. The airline tends to serve food and drink at the same time instead of drinks first but you had to ask for a second drink. Seats are comfortable. Biggest let down is they do not offer a choice of food for coeliac (gluten free). Fortunately we had contacted the airline and we took our own food but the staff on the flight did their best to find something for my wife. Ground staff don't care if your luggage has priority and on arriving at Heathrow although ours was marked priority it was one of the last ones out. Overall flight was good but waiting for luggage at Heathrow not good.

### "Service with a smile, lots of patience"
Not Verified |  Would love to share my appreciation for the 2 wonderful ladies manning the check in counter, Vistara Airways at T3, New Delhi on 5th April. Could gather their names are Ronali and Reena. Service with a smile, lots of patience, helping me out i while I had to transfer my pastry cutlery from cabin to checked baggage as I struggled to rush forward to the ongoing flight was a big help. Keep it up ladies. I remain a Vistara loyal flier. Only issue is that inflight food quality has gone down. Hope you can do something about that. Do give a big thanks to your ladies mentioned here.

### "Very kind staff"
Not Verified |  Wonderful experience. Very kind staff. Neat flight. Pilot was perfect in takeoff and landing, food was very good, hygiene and cleanliness is top class

### "Overall good experience"
Good experience, check in was smooth so as boarding, at Srinagar additional security check required and was done smoothly by airline. Seat was comfortable, was a short route so only snacks was provided, that can be improved. Inflight entertainment is provided through wifi, connect to flight wifi which can be used to open Vistara on flight entertainment website on individual devices. Overall good experience.

### "avoid booking their B737"
Bad experience, booked for Premium Economy and at the last moment they changed to Economy with excuse that aircraft has been changed and no premium economy in that aircraft, also during call they said that now we have window and middle seats in mid row but at the last moment when we were doing web checking come to know that we both were given middle seats (so certainly on different rows). The app is pathetic, tried many times to change but unsuccessful, finally was able to do using laptop. Call centre is another bad experience, too long waiting time, also didn't get any confirmation mail about change from premium economy to economy, only refund was done on time. Even the aircraft was too cramped, very small leg space with respect to other Vistara aircraft, just like any LCC whereas Vistara is a full fledged carrier, my suggestion is to avoid booking their B737, their A320/321 are good. Food was ok for such a short route which was just 1 hour 30 min.

### "professional and welcoming"
Not Verified |  I am satisfied with their service. They were really friendly and understanding and much better than other cabin crews they were professional and welcoming. I am very happy and definitely recommend this airline to others who are interested in a friendly environment while travelling. It’s also suitable for those with large families.

### "onboard experience for these short flights is top notch"
Goa to Bombay in an A320neo in Business Class. Vitara's onboard experience for these short flights is top notch. Good seats, good service, good snacks. My one complaint is the choice of music in flight: India is a land with a great musical tradition and instead of featuring an Indian music selection, Vistara for some reason has decided to go with bad Western music. Also - when is Vistara going to provide inflight wifi?

### "Customer service is pathetic"
Delhi to Varanasi. Customer service is pathetic. I have a ticket raised nearly a month ago regarding refund of extra luggage. This has not been replied by the customer relations people. The flight was cancelled at least a week before the flight date. At the time of booking the ticket from Delhi to Varanasi, I had booked extra luggage as I was travelling from overseas. For this refund I had raised a request. I sent several emails to the Indian customer relations people and having failed to get a reply I forwarded the e-mail to the Sydney office. I did get a reply from Sydney office who threw their hands in air, informing me that I need to follow up with the office in India - the headquarters - probably equally frustrated as I am. Due to all this saga, they lost the business to Air India - the same Airline that they have acquired. I hope they can provide the same service as Air India if not better - and I doubt it. I have used their service once and my review for other items is based on that.

### "no welcome Champagne"
Not Verified | The check-in was a very long queue. The Air France lounge was very nice. Onboard no welcome Champagne. Aperif none. Drinks with the food were two mediocre wine bottles were ushered, one Côte du Rhone and the other was a bad Chilean wine. Our dinner was mediocre if not worse. The seats are  bad, the legs are in a very narrow tunnel which makes it impossible to turn your feet/legs. We could not sleep more that 2 hours;. Then we were in transit in Delhi to catch the Vistara flight to Bombay. No Vistara lounge available and we had 4.30hrs transit time. We will never fly Vistara again in our life.

### "Best ever airline I have seen"
Best ever airline I have seen. Best crew members, loved to travel through Vistara. Great service both at airport counter as well in airplane.

### " on-board experience is top notch"
The check-in process was a downer. The staff didn't seem enthusiastic. For a Business Class desk this is doubly strange. Vistara is currently the finest full service airline in India and the on-board experience is top notch. The seating is comfortable for short-haul, the service warm, and the snacks served outstanding. When is Vistara going to start offering inflight WiFi ?

### "These little gestures make the world just a bit more livable"
It takes a lot for me to find a website to put my experience with a particular airline into a paragraph or two. However, when I had a distasteful experience with Indigo Airlines on my way to a Bagdogra and when the reason of my disappointment was absolutely reversed by Vistara Airlines, I had to take out time to write this review. My luggage bag's wheel went missing due to mishandling by the Indigo airline staff. I normally don't have the patience to drain my energy in fighting, Therefore, I received my luggage and left the airport. What came as a pleasant surprise was that I when I boarded my Vistara flight on my way back, carrying the same luggage bag with missing wheel, Vistara, despite taking a written note from me during checking in, of the damaged luggage bag, assumed that the luggage bag could have been damaged by them, fixed it with a new wheel. When I got my bag with the fixed wheel I knew I had to put this review to thank them. These little gestures make the world just a bit more livable.

### "Awesome flight Experience"
Not Verified |  Aircraft was cleanest, cabin crew were awesome, one of my family members forgot their power bank in luggage bag but vistara staff was very helpful in returning it to me and they were very calm and patient. Awesome flight Experience. It landed before the scheduled Landing time. 10 out of 10 for Vistara

### "Awful service experience"
Not Verified |  Awful service experience. Staff were very rude, did not care about customers. The food selection was poor and had no fizzy drinks on the way back to UK. I had to wait 3 hours to check my baggage as the staff were extremely slow with with all customers complaining and had to run to get to the plane. In addition they charge for you to book an economy seat! At least 40% were chargeable seats! They do not value your money.

### "flight was excellent"
London to Mumbai, flight was excellent. Dreamliner flight. The staff, the cabin crew were good. But I feel the flight from Mumbai to Chennai was not up to the mark. Not faced any issue but I feel it's not as standardised as the international London to Mumbai flight. The food was amazing and overall I love Vistara more than BA.

### "asked me to book a new ticket"
Flights are new, clean & crew members are wearing Covid-19 PPE kit. I & my wife had Vistara tickets in the same flight segments. I booked my India portion of the ticket online through Vistara website. But my wife’s ticket was booked through a different agent. On Oct 3rd, we arrived at Baggage drop-off ticketing counter at at 6:05AM. Our flight departure was scheduled for 7:00AM. At the Baggage drop counter, they didn’t accept my baggage & but took my wife’s luggage & placed in the weighing machine. The agent in the counter informed me that the Baggage drop-off counter just got closed & I am late. I asked how you are taking her luggage, the agent told because she is having international ticket. My wife didn’t want to take the 7:00AM flight alone. So she took her luggage off from weighing belt. The check-in counter manager then advised us that, they would able do a complementary accommodation in next immediate flight & advised us to go to sales counter there & inform about this. We both went to Vistara customer service sales counter in Terminal-3. However the service representative there said that next flight I can take is at 5:50pm not 11:10 am. But she didn’t confirm my ticket & instead asked to wait. In the meantime my wife’s ticket was confirmed to 5:50pm flight by the booking agent. My ticket was still not confirmed until 12 noon. At this time the sales representative asked me to book a new ticket instead & pay the full price. I informed the representative that I was advised by check-in area manager that I would get a complementary adjustment in next flight. She asked me to bring the check-in area manager to sales counter which I couldn't do. By 1 pm, I went back to sales counter & wanted to pay the full price to book the ticket. At this time, the sales representative said there is NO ticket available to BBSR on 5:50pm and advised me to take next day flight. I informed the counter that there is ‘available ticket’ showing online. I went ahead and booked it using Vistara.com website by paying full for 5:50pm. But accidentally the first name in the new ticket was my wife’s first name instead of my first name.

### "wonderful flying experience"
Thanks to Vistara for giving such a wonderful flying experience. I am happy with your new added facilities and the staff at Hyderabad airport. They helped me with my issue of my extra large luggage. Thanks to Mr Mahendra and Mr Ashok

### "the crew was good"
Not Verified |  I liked the airline, the crew was good and the food was also good. I liked their internet it was really fast better than my office one. I recommend everyone to use Vistara - though its bit costly but its worth it.

### "Vistara was a fantastic experience"
I had flown from Delhi to Mumbai for some personal work. Vistara was a fantastic experience, they took great care of hygiene throughout the flight and this was the first time I experienced full flat beds in domestic business class within India. Business class seats had quite big screens for IFE and the service was pretty good as well given the pandemic. Since this was the morning flight, breakfast was scrambled eggs with paratha which was quite good with a bread roll and some fruits on the side, pretty good for a 1.5 hour long flight. Overall quite impressed, of course the pandemic has done away with the usual business class goodies of a welcome towel and a drink but then such are the times we live in.

### "disappointed with Vistara’s in-flight food"
Extremely disappointed with Vistara’s in-flight food. Expected better from a full service carrier than to be served a baked roll and a bottle of water. My prior journey was with an LCC where I purchased a hot meal and a refreshing beverage.

### "very pleasant travel experience"
The service was nice, kind and prompt response from the staff, provided a small snack for 2.30 hrs flight. Seats and ambiance was much comfortable. No delays except the usual Delhi air traffic delay. The baggage reached safe. I am giving 9 points due to the behavior of one staff during check in process. He was hesitant to respond to my questions. Overall a very pleasant travel experience.

### "insisted me to pay £160 to check it in"
This was my first time flying with Vistara. I travelled in business class and I was the only one there. I had two check in suitcases under 25 kgs, 1 small bagpack and 1 cabin bag. I had one extra cabin bag which weighed 8 kgs. They did not allow me to take it on board and insisted me to pay £160 to check it in. I asked the agent if she can reduce the price a little if I have to check the bag in and she refused. Never am I ever going to do the mistake of travelling with this airline.

### "Never again Vistara!"
Had a horrendous journey back to the UK as ground staff did not have any idea on transit rules by country nor were they familiar with bubble agreements. Manager shows a message on Whatsapp claiming to be a set of guidelines followed by them. Staff need to be trained in customer service especially if they claim to be part of Singapore Airlines delivering world class service. Ground staff at the booking counter at New Delhi airport seem to be fed-up of life and feel they're doing passengers a favour by answering their queries. Never again Vistara!

### "eager to help and nothing was trouble at all"
Right from boarding to landing, Vistara conducted it's duty with utmost sincerity and dedication. Premium economy cabins are spacious and so are seats. Cabin planning is good. They secure cabin from Economy class hence it feels private and less loud. The mood light shades they use are really appealing and food is just fantastic! In fact all flights originating from India, serves fantastic food! Hands down it's the best meal I have eaten on-board a flight. While I am at it, I might add that they can be bit generous with serving portions. IFE is bit boring and it needs more variety and latest movies. All this on one side and their cabin crew on another side. They elevate the experience on to another level. Vistara's crew are very professional and warm-hearted people. I could see that they are eager to help and nothing was trouble at all. Crew on DEL-FRA sector were the best crew I have experienced in my years of travel. They take individual orders from premium eco cabin and nothing comes from trolley. The whole experience made me feel at home. They exceeded the standards that of SIA and here after it will be my preferred airline to travel! If this level of service is maintained, once Vistara expands globally, it will give a run for buck to big 3 in gulf. Finally, it is an airline for here to stay and has a bright future.

### "I had missed my flight"
I had missed my flight due to service from the check-in team. For a flight of 8am, I was in the check-in line, having done mobile check-in earlier, before 6:45am. However, the check-in process took more than 30 min. By then, the person at the counter had refused to take my luggage and suggested that I just try 'my luck' by taking my luggage through security. I has asked in case the team can help me with security or thereafter through buggy. He said he can't help with either and this service was offered later once I missed my flight.

### "amazing service and new aircraft"
One of the best full-service airlines in India with amazing service and new aircraft which are well maintained in terms of cleanliness and hygiene. Vistara Economy has good legroom. The food offered was complementary and was good. Amazing inflight entertainment (to be viewed on your phone).

### "In flight service was good"
Good experience, done web check-in and traveling without checking baggage so no check in experience, boarding was smooth. In flight service was good and so was food. Aircraft looks clean and hygienic.

### "Not a pleasant experience"
Not a pleasant experience, starting from boarding to inflight. Boarding was chaotic, no social distancing. Food served to me was the same as economy class,  probably they have shortage of meal so served me the one for economy class. After boarding no one ask or provide water, only after take off.

### "no option other than to pay up"
The check in staff was not informed on the baggage policy, made me wait for about 15 mins while she checked with someone on call. There was no response from the other line and she made a random decision to charge me for my carry on bag (INR 8000) which was apparently way more than the cost of ticket itself. Her supervisor was just interested in moving the queue and she would not listen to the details of my booking. Eventually I was getting late for the flight and had no option other than to give in at that time to get my boarding pass. More details: I was flying from Chicago to Chandigarh and my domestic leg from New Delhi to Chandigarh was booked on United Airlines operated by Vistara. I had 2 check in bags + carry on bag + laptop bag, all under permissible weight limits and typical of an international flight from USA to India. I was not sure about the size of the aircraft in the domestic flight so I inquired if my carry on bag would fit in or not. They mentioned it won’t and even if it did it is above 7kg limit for a carry on bag and instead of taking the risk I should check in and pay for 15kgs instead. This was in spite of me showing them the Vistara policy which had to honour the same baggage allowance for connections from international flights within 48 hrs. Her recommendation was that I either magically get rid of my 8kg belongings or pay up to board the flight, given the departure time I had no option other than to pay up. To make matters worse the supervisor on the floor was completely rude and interested in chatting with her friends than pay attention to any questions from customers. Fast forward, I boarded the flight, half empty and huge spaces for carry on bags in the flights and knowing all that she still made me check in the bag for additional amount. I felt completely ridiculous and betrayed and I hope that the airlines invest some time in teaching manners and policies to their front end staff.

### "expect an outstanding onboard experience"
Goa to Bombay in Business Class. We have come to expect an outstanding onboard experience on Vistara and this time it was no different. My one point of criticism was the transport from the aircraft to the terminal upon landing in Bombay: the bus was packed to the gills in complete disregard for the current pandemic situation we are in. What is the use of masks and face shields if you are going to have people brushing against you and breathing down your neck?

### "service onboard was flawless"
Flew Bombay to Goa in Business Class in January 2021. Vistara made a show of following pandemic protocol by handing out masks and face shields before boarding. Then they promptly packed to the gills the bus that transports passengers to the aircraft (reason I am deducting 2 points in my rating). The service onboard was flawless, the seats very comfortable for short haul flights. Vistara Business is best premium option currently available in India.

### "I was very impressed"
Bengaluru to Mumbai by Vistara. Today I tried flying the new feeling for the first time and I was very impressed. I had checked in online for the flight and had the printout of the boarding pass however during check in I was really happy and appreciated with the check in agent Vidhya who was kind enough to give us an extra legroom seat for our flight which was not chargeable and that was hugely appreciated. Boarding and departure was well on time and the seat was quite comfortable and soft. The extra legroom seats were very comfortable and it was also a pleasant surprise to know that the airline have also started resuming their inflight meal services which consisted of a veg sandwich, cookies and a bottle of water. There was also the inflight entertainment Vistara World which was accessible from the devices but I didn't go through it in detail although it seemed it had a decent collection of bollywood / hollywood movies. Arrival was ahead of schedule and baggage retrieval was also very smooth. Overall I have to say that this was an excellent flight service for such a short journey, I can only imagine how much better flying on premium economy / business would be. If one is looking for comfort and luxurious flying you won't be disappointed with Vistara. I might travel in Premium Economy or Business in the future if possible. Highly recommend it.

### "non availability of bus"
Raipur to Delhi on 28th November. After reaching Delhi Airport the cabin crew forced us to stand in flight for around 40 minutes due to non availability of bus. When we try to discuss this to crew members they did not respond and ignored us.

### "COVID test has to be provided"
A mandatory COVID test has to be provided at Delhi Airport before I can proceed to my home state Kerala. I missed my connection flight because I was at the airport waiting for results. I emailed Vistara and there was no reply. The airport said that they have instructed the airline to provide a reschedule. After speaking to the Vistara office I am told the next flight is tomorrow and I will have to pay for the next flight.

### "customer service is superb"
Not Verified |  The customer service of this particular airline is superb. The cabin crew are very friendly and approachable. Safety measures provided in the flight was good in quality. Thanks for adding more colours to my first flying experience with Vistara.

### "had only 5 kg of excess luggage"
I am student and traveling during pandemic time (covid-19) I was vacating my hostel and had only 5 kg of excess luggage but this airline charged me of rs. 8050 that they are not allowing the luggage to be kept in the cabin. Zero customer satisfaction and and can't help people even during this pandemic time. They are just opened for making money, worst airline and experience.

### "will not refund my money"
Guwahati to Delhi. My flight booked through Cheapoair for April 15th was canceled, Vistara could not provide the service I paid them for, and Cheapoair will not refund my money. It reflects poorly on your company.

### "charged a fee for the refund"
Me and my partner were recently in India. We booked a ticket with Vistara from Goa to Delhi in order to be able to take our repatriation flight back to Europe. The Indian Government cancelled all domestic and internationals flights, including our domestic Vistara flight from Goa to Delhi. We asked the airline to give us a full refund for the flight that was cancelled. The airline refunded us half of the money back for the flight, saying that they didn't cancelled the flight, that it was government decision and that's why they charged a fee for the refund, and we only got back half of the money we payed. It's sad that a company like Vistara is profiting from a flight that never took place and that it is not willing to give a full refund to its customers specially in this time of crisis. I will not book anymore flights with Vistara again.

### "don't give us our refund"
Kochi to Delhi. The Airline cancel our flight on 10th April and they don't give us our refund for tickets booked through BudgetAir. We need the refund because we are from Spain and we couldn't travel.

### "dont respond to mail and phone"
Hyderabad to Delhi. Vistara airline dont respond to mail and phone and I have tried to contact them by both mail and phone from last 5 days and every time I call the line will be busy and it is very important for me to address my problem to vistara airline due to this Corona issue. I am unable to travel to airport because all facilities are stopped in Hyderabad.

### "Really pleasant experience"
Not Verified |  Delhi to Goa. Really pleasant experience flying with Vistara today. Slightly late taking off but arrived at the scheduled time. Wasn’t expecting any food or drinks to be provided in flight but pleasantly surprised to have a full meal provided. Plane was really modern and clean. Staff were excellent and will definitely fly with Vistara again.

### "experience was not good"
Not Verified |  Delhi to Mumbai. Departure time was 4:55pm it departed at 5:10 pm and arrival timing was 7:05 pm and we reached at 7:45. For opening the gates they took another half an hour everyone were standing and waiting in the flight. After reaching they announced our baggage to be collected at counter 11 and after 30 minutes of waiting we started searching on all the counters and found our baggage on counter 14. At 9 pm we left airport. Vistara doesn't value time. Vistara flight attendants are good, interior of the flight is also good, but traveling experience was not good.

### "late for the check in"
Not Verified |  Bangalore to Delhi. We were late for the check in. The flight timing is 7am we arrived 6.15 near the Vistara customer service. They did not let us board the flight and no refund done. Very bad service no concern about the customer. We wasted around 30,000 rupees for this.

### "won't be travelling with them again"
Kolkata to Amritsar via Delhi, we had a short connection time of around an hour. The CCU to DEL flight was delayed thereby reducing transfer time severely. I raised it with the cabin crew and they showed no interest. We ran to the domestic transfer desk, up to that point there was nobody to help or ask. At the transfer desk vistara staff couldn't even be bothered to look at us: busy with their mobiles. I instructed them to call the ATQ flight team and let them know of our situation. They called them and asked "what should I do with these people, do you want them on the flight?". We were told we have to rush, I reminded them that their flight was delayed. The response was yes I know but now you run. The ATQ flight departed from Gate 52!! The opposite end of the airport. Upon check-in at CCU we enquired as to what will happen in case of a delay, we were assured that we will be collected and taken to the next flight, perhaps even a tarmac transfer: forget this, we weren't offered a buggie transfer to the gate in Delhi. Had I been travelling alone perhaps this wouldn't bother me so, however I was travelling with my elderly parents: in fact, my father celebrated his 80th birthday with a sprint through Delhi airport due to Vistara's incompetence. The return journey was equally bad in terms of a another hectic transfer and zero assistance from vistara. This time the chap at the transfer desk refused to call ahead and let them know we would be arriving. For all four flights the cabin crew were disengaged, service was slow. On the return, for both sectors non-veg meals were not available. It took an age for the bags to be delivered. Citing the above I asked Vistara to refund me the difference between Premium economy and economy as a premium service was simply not provided, they refused. We just received the standard template of apologies, needless to say won't be travelling with them again.

### "delivered excellent service"
Delhi to Kolkata. Airline delivered excellent service. Cabin crews were sincere to help passengers. Food was good in terms of quantity and quality. Although it was a 2:30 hrs domestic flight , they provided hot towels. Although tickets are bit costly, but paying a bit for this quality services is worth.

### "Amazing level of service"
Not Verified |  Dubai to Mumbai with Vistara. Lovely features and free seat and meal selection, convenient and very nice flights. I will highly recommend for all my friends and family. Amazing level of service and within your budget.

### "didn't bother to listen"
Normally I have a very good experience with Vistara ground staff and in flight staff.However my experience was terrible with a ground staff when I flew Delhi to Hyderabad. She seemed to be rude and didn't bother to patiently listen. She was rude with other passengers.

### "a very bad experience"
Delhi to Varanasi, the ground staff transferred us to a different flight 3 hours later than the original flight that we had booked. Although I had booked my flight ticket a week ago , the reason they gave for this was that the flight was overbooked. On top of that the staff was unapologetic and didn’t bother about the customer satisfaction at all. Overall a very bad experience with vistara.

### "Fantastic ground service"
Delhi to Chennai. Awesome service.! I got late due to unexpected traffic but since I checked in online, the ground team kept constantly following up and ensured we board the plane. Fantastic ground service.

### "a pleasant flying experience"
Bagdogra to New Delhi. Had a wonderful experience with Vistara. Although the flight was delayed a bit but it was fine as it was delayed due to the weather. The crew greeted us cheerfully. My seat mate were elderly people, they needed assistance to go to the washroom, the crew assisted with a complain. They politely reminded everyone about the instructions. The smell of the cabin was pleasing complimented by the boarding music. The food was of superior quality was delicious. The in-flight entertainment streamed directly in personal device was a nice touch.. Although the live map can be upgraded. Overall a pleasant flying experience. Vistara is truly India's premium and best airline.

### "food options available at piers"
Delhi to Ranchi. Airport experience is overall good, good staffing. Even food options are now available at piers now which is impressive and time saving. Easy to travel from Delhi airport always.

### "learnt that we had been overbooked"
Delhi to Bagdogra. We arrived 1 hour 30 minutes before this domestic flight. A first check-in counter sent us to a second check-in counter where we queued again, which sent us to a third check-in counter where we queued again, which sent us back to the second checkin counter. There seemed to be a problem but everyone looked a bit embarrassed to tell us. Finally, we were told that the checkin time had been exceeded. We were directed toward a manager. He looked annoyed when we came to talk to him and got rid of us by finding us a powerless assistant to talk to. We finally learnt that we had been overbooked, which is surprising as we arrived pretty early. The assistant told us "good news, you'll get a full refund" whereas it was obvious that we were not going to pay for a service we did not get. Vistara made things worse by refusing to buy another companies tickets. We finally bought a new ticket at our own expense and wasted a full day of holiday.

### "reached airport 45 mins before flight"
Mumbai to Chandigarh. I reached the airport 45 minutes before my flight. Ground staff told us that airline will not be accepting us as their customer and counter is closed. Vistara airlines has caused me monetary and unmonetory loss as it was family trip. I

### "a great airline to fly with"
Ahmedabad to Delhi. I had booked Vistara flight because had heard a lot about them and was the first time I flew them and felt great to be given a luxury treatment and service on a domestic flight. I flew premium economy and was surprised that even on a 320 they manage to seperate the cabins and also served welcome drinks and the efficient boarding and deboarding. Priorirty tagged and received quicker too. Overall such a great airline to fly with.

### "My bag was tampered with"
Amritsar to Delhi. My bag was tampered with and the security lock was removed after I checked in the baggage at Amritsar Airport and I received it with a broken security lock at Delhi airport. Valuable items are missing from my check in baggage. Poor response from Vistara Customer Care, despite repeated mails and calls.

### "Overall a great journey"
Delhi to Ranchi. I flew Vistara after a long time and it was great to see that they have maintained their same high class standard. The flight was delayed due to weather reasons however the smiling and courteous crew made us feel welcomed, also the food was very delicious. Now they have also started streaming content to personal phones and tablets which has nice collection of movies and shows and music. Overall a great journey.

### "highly recommend this airline"
Not Verified |  Fantastic experience on our trip from Goa to Delhi. Exceptional service provided by Vankatesh, the manager at the check in for the flight. Went over and above to help facilitate a problem I had at the airport. I would highly recommend this airline to anyone.

### "really wonderful experience"
Goa to Mumbai. It was really wonderful experience to fly with Vistara. Ground staff is very helpful and cooperative, very fast in processing ticket and she also guided me and helped in getting with security check because I was little late. It was pleasure to fly with Vistara and definitely opt for Vistara in future. Thank you.

### "Overall a very good flight"
Lucknow to Delhi. This was my first time flying with Vistara. I was surprised that they indeed are the best, the ground staff was very courteous and also the cabin crew was nice and attentive even though our flight was just an hour they served all the passengers with snack boxes with options of veg and non veg sandwiches also those passengers with lite fares had an option to buy on board which is nice. The sandwich was very delicious also in the snack box were a water bottle and a cookie packet which was equally delicious. Legroom was amazing and so was the condition of the plane which was clean, for inflight entertainment they have wifi streaming to personal devices which worked fine. Overall a very good flight and Vistara won my heart.

### "best domestic airline in India"
Mumbai to Delhi. The best domestic airline in India I have taken. Their cabin crew are the best, very friendly and professional. Their food, Wow! They have special packages for students, of which some domestic airlines in India I know do not have.

### "stop flying this carrier"
I am a gold tier member with Vistara and it is sad to see that their service standards going downhill. Yesterday I was flying from Hyderabad to Delhi with my wife and we were both booked on their Premium Economy class. I happen to have four upgrade vouchers which were given to me by a Credit card company which allows upgrade to the next class. Once I reached the airport, I told the check in lady that I had the vouchers and wanted to upgrade us to Business class and showed her the vouchers. She did not know what to do with them. She asked her senior  to come and have a look and he said that she should call up the ticketing counter and check if two seats were available in Business class and to tell them that two passengers wanted to use the vouchers for this upgrade. The ticketing people said it was fine so they asked that my vouchers be sent across to the ticketing people to carry out the formalities so that they could issue us the new Boarding passes in Business class. At that time, two gentlemen wearing the uniform of Vistara approached the Business class counter and got themselves checked in to Business class. This meant that the last two seats available got taken by the crew and they tell me that they can no longer offer me the two seats as the Business class is full. I got upset and told him that he had already allocated the two seats to us and also spoken to the ticketing people so why did he give up these seats. He then lied to me that they had confirmed booking. If that was indeed the case then why did the ticketing people agree to give us the two seats? I conveyed my displeasure  and told him that it makes no sense to be a Gold tier member and not be given priority to use these vouchers and they gave these seats to the crew who ought to have lower priority than the fare paying customers. He understood what I was saying and sent to the two gentlemen. Apparently one was nice enough to say that he would give up his Business class seat but the other person would not. They told us that we could consider taking up one of the seats in Business class. I declined the offer and told him that I would prefer to fly with my wife. As I was waiting for the check in, I also tweeted to the airline and explained to them what had transpired. They gave a standard reply that they would look into this and get back. Today a lady from Vistara reverted and apologised at the "miscommunication" between the ground staff and the controller. As I see it, there was no miscommunication and it was very clearly informed to me that we were getting the upgrade. To rub salt on my wounds, she gave a "wonderful" offer to extend a 10% discount on any one ticket for my future trip I might take on Vistara. She did not utter a word regarding the attitude of the crew who put self over the customer. I told her to keep her charity and I now intend to send them my four upgrade vouchers along with my membership card and stop flying this carrier.

### "wonderful experience"
Delhi to Hyderabad. A wonderful experience every time you travel by Vistara it's a happening experience. The staff is so professional and courteous, onboard food is marvellous. It's a value for money

### "a great experience with Vistara"
Mumbai to Delhi. This was any first time flying a 2 hour long flight with vistara and was looking forward to their hospitality and service having flown them on short sectors. I was happy that that the airline is keeping it service standards high and maintaining it since day they started flying the seats in economy were very comfortable with great legroom and the plane was kept very clean.The staff from ground to cabin crew were the most kind and helpfull that I've ever met.. So overall ice again a great experience with Vistara.

### "service has gotten better"
Delhi to Lucknow. This was my flight with vistara after a long time, and their service has gotten better and better. They are the most environment friendly airline in India doing away with the plastic bottles and serving water in paper cups. The cabin crew specially announced the economy meal options with full details of vegetarian and non veg meals. For IFE they stream content to personal devices which is good enough.

### "professional and helpful"
Delhi to Goa. Vistara boarding in Delhi was super fast as they have a dedicated line for different levels of their card holders. Also they give you 5 kilos extra once you have a silver card which is very useful as it becomes a 20kg allowance. Boarding was 10 minutes late for which there was an apology by the captain once on board. Seat space is great. Had 2 empty seats next me as well. They served a full meal on board - not excellent, but not bad. Staff were very professional and helpful. Arrival on time and priority bags on the belt before I reached them.

### "Vistara is much better"
Pune to Delhi. It was my second flight journey and I was with my wife and 8 month old Infant. I went pune by spice jet and came back in Vistara so in comparison, Vistara is much better in all the things ground staff and crew member. First they had a seat belt for infant that other cheap airline do not have; second  there are some special safety instruction for infant, in Vistara , the crew member asked me if I wish to listen instruction in Hindi or English and I choose English. This thing is very very important for me because if it is about safty of my Son I would like to listen in hindi only in which I am more comfortable. Again after giving me the seat belt for infant crew member asked me if I know how to use that and when I said no she helped us. Crew member and ground staff in Vistara do not behave like a Robots and that is very important thing

### "definitely fly Vistara in the future"
Not Verified |  Mumbai to Goa. I flew with air vistara for the first time and my experience with them was amazing. It was also the first time and route where this airline was operating a Boeing 737 instead of A320. Even though my flight got delayed by an hour but as soon as we entered the flight, the cabin crew had smiles on their faces and were greatly looking after their passengers throughout the flight. Would definitely fly Vistara in the future.

### "seat belt without any instruction"
I was travelling with my 4 month old baby for the first time and chose Vistara for its good reviews and in-flight comfort but it turned out to be one of my worst experiences. The cabin crew handed me the infant seat belt without any instruction. When the flight started moving, cabin crew instructed me to feed the baby during takeoff but by that time my baby was frantic and started crying and I was stressed out. Had the instruction and been given bit in advance, I could have prepared so to avoid inconvenience to my baby and fellow passengers. No clear instruction was given about how the seat belt has to be tied for an infant. A cabin crew came to inspect the seat belt before takeoff, she said it has to be tied around the infant and attached to my belt but did not wait to see if its been done correctly.

### "One of the best airline"
Not Verified |  Delhi to Srinagar. One of the best airline. Very friendly staff unlike other domestic carriers. Smooth transition right from check-in to boarding. I will recommend this to everyone.

### "helpful cabin crew"
Srinagar to Mumbai via Delhi. Very helpful cabin crew. Good ground staff. Excellent quality food. As of now best airline in India. From cleanliness to comfort perfect experience.

### "service are very helpful"
Delhi to Kochi. Food facility and air hostess service are very helpful. They provide every required needs With very sensitive manner.

### "best airline by far"
Bagdogra to Delhi. Without the fantastic and amazing service given by the staff and management at Vistara Airlines, I would not have been able to fly that day. I have a traumatic brain injury caused by a stroke and am extremely sensitive to noise and crowds. This is the worst airport I have ever encountered. I have flown there before so I was already feeling panicky. Luckily this time my 20 year old son accompanied me. Due to the roadworks throughout Sikkim, we had taken a private taxi early morning to reach IXB in time for our flight. We were very early so stopped at a good, quiet restaurant 15 minutes away from the airport. I took into the restaurant my BOSE sound cancelling headphones and silicone ear implants to make sure they were charged and ready for the impending chaos. We arrived at IXB 2.5 hours prior to departure. This airport has no priority security, no priority check in., no O disability facilities, NO lounge. To call it an international airport is a joke! As soon as the taxi pulled away I realised that I'ld left my headphones and silicone ear implants plus charger in the restaurant. I had a panic attack. My son sat me down in the shade where I vomited numerous times while he contacted the taxi driver and the restaurant. They had gone. My son has headphones so he gave me his but by now I was shaking and suffering Aphasia (inability to speak). He contacted Vistara staff who took me into the managers office, organised water, a calm and quiet space and informed us that they would board us last and 2 members of staff would accompany us through security. They helped my son with bag check in and boarding passes while other staff took care of me. They also helped us with items which we had left at the helicopter office. My son had an early morning flight from Delhi to Stockholm the next day. We both agreed that without the help of Vistara's amazing staff, in the worst conditions possible for my disability (IXB), he may not have made either flight as he would have been forced to take me to hospital. A big thank you to the Vistara Airline manager, who personally accompanied my son through security, and the professional staff at IXB and on board the aircraft. I first flew Vistara 1.5 years ago and have not flown another airline in India since then. This is India's best airline by far. The app works, the web site works and the level of service is far above most international airlines.

### "Excellent flight"
Kolkata to Port Blair with Vistara. Excellent flight with tasty quality food, comfortable seating arrangement, far better than other domestic airlines. Landed before time. Colourful and beautiful flight.

### "Highly recommended"
Delhi to Chennai. Spacious seats, early boarding and on time departure and arrival made for a positive first impression. My wife, toddler and I flew Vistara because of the higher quality of service and in flight food, because that's one less thing to deal. We were late to the baggage claim belt and Vistara had staff trying to contact me by phone and were even able to contact my family to ensure we got our checked in baggage. What more can one ask for these days. Highly recommended.

### "ground staff was impolite"
Delhi to Cochin. The aircraft was new and seats were good and food was okay. But the ground staff was impolite and even the supervisor at arrival airport used improper demeneor while we presented our concern. Customer support takes forever to respond and no follow up.

### "disappointed with Vistara"
Delhi to Mumbai. Very disappointed with Vistara. I paid the premium price for Vistara expecting a flight better than the budget airline. The only positive was a free meal. The flight was late, the cabin was cramped with minimal leg space.

### "customer support is worst"
Hyderabad to Delhi. Flight is good, but customer support is worst. I had to cancel one of the passenger travelling with me. Called customer care and he confirmed the ticket was cancelled. But I did not receive any refund or at least any message/mail confirming that the ticket was cancelled. When I requested them to send me cancellation/refund confirmations, they simply send me another link to pay 300Rs. For what I don't know the reason. Neither the refund amount around 1300(which informed by customer care executive) is also not reflected in my card. I dont mind 1300 but this airlines should have courtesy to send me cancellation receipt/message which I need to file in my company expenses.

### "definitely be flying them again"
Cochi to Chandigarh via Delhi. I was traveling alone in India for business. As a female, this wasn't the most comfortable experience. I had to go from Cochi to Chandigarh to see a vendor so I booked this flight at the last minute. When I got to the airport I learned about the weight limit for carry-ons. I begged and pleaded for them to make an exception because I had work materials and several other important items. I offered to pay for the bag but they said they really weren't able to allow weight overages in economy class. They could only do so for business class customers. The two agents tried hard to help me get an affordable business class. We weren't able to find any that were affordable, but they tried just about every thing they could to ensure that my bag was tended to. In the end they put special labeling on my bag  and did virtually everything they could to make sure my bag made it to my final destination. This meant a lot to me, given the circumstances. I've never seen service like this at an airline. They genuinely cared about my seemingly stupid luggage concern. The actual flight was great - organized boarding, great snacks, friendly airline attendants, and easy flight. This was so comforting and calming to me during a stressful time. Will definitely be flying with them again because I know that their service is impeccable and that if anything goes wrong they will do everything they possibly can to make it right.

### "I wasn't able to upgrade"
Delhi to Chennai. I wasn't able to upgrade to Business class multiple times. The voucher upgrade that they offered through their CV frequent flyer program you would never be able to do so. It's only allowed 1 hr before departure which in a domestic route is full since they only have 8 business class seats. I have this feedback to them on my earlier flights as well when I wasn't able to upgrade. What a shame, I was just starting to like them.

### "Food tasty and served hot"
Not Verified | Chennai to Kolkata. One of the best experience I ever have had. Crew members are very cooperative. This flight had many passengers who were actually patients. The behaviour of the cabin crew towards them was really appreciable. Food I opted was veg and was tasty and served hot. The flight landed before time. I must specifically mention that the interior of the aircraft was a very modest one with light music being played. I wish Vistara continues this quality of service and quality of aircraft maintenance in future too.

### "crew are the greatest asset"
Awesome crew members. The crew are the greatest asset who provide exemplary service. I would like to thank the team on board in UK 753 Delhi to Ranchi on 15th October 2018. Please compliment the entire team on my behalf.

### "one of the best airlines"
Delhi to Ahmedabad. Vistara is one of the best airlines that I have flown with. I had booked the ticket from my cell phone just a few hours before departure. During check-in, the agent upgraded me to Premium Economy. As I was entering the aircraft, I told the flight attendant that I was feeling dehydrated and if I could have a glass of water. She instantly gave me a bottle of water. Vistara served complimentary breakfast during the 1 hour flight from New Delhi to Amhedabad, but what really set Vistara apart was their outstanding customer service.

### "a worthy option to choose"
Lucknow to Delhi. I have flown with Vistara earlier and recently in August. Overall, what I like about this airline is that staff is friendly and helpful both on ground and in cabin. Seat pitch and quality is very nice plus flexibility to choose preferred seats is added advantage. On board services are very good and aircraft interior is fresh. Only thing I felt was that while flying on short route the food given in premium economy was at par with the normal economy and they used to give a welcome drink earlier in premium economy but I didn't find that in this flight. Plus the quality of refreshment was not good as I have experienced earlier. But overall on long flights, its very good and overall a worthy option to choose for flying in India. Eagerly waiting for its international flights now.

### "a good experience"
Delhi to Chennai left almost 45 minutes late. Thereafter there was congestion at the runway at the take off point. Further ahead,the seat belt sign was not switched off for another 45 minutes after take off siting bad weather. Thus it must have been almost two hours from the time one reported to the boarding gate till the time the seat belt sign was switched off. I was traveling with my elderly parents in their eighties who wanted to go to the wash room about 20 minutes after the flight took off but were not allowed. However, the flight attendants wheeled in the food trolleys and started serving food during that time when the seat belt sign was still on. Other than this issue, the staff were quite efficient and courteous. The leg room was better than other domestic airlines. The food was good and adequate and the overall experience was pleasant. Another, irritant pertains to the prevalent norm in Chennai wherein the staff who assist with the wheel chair haggle over receiving a hefty tip . Overall traveling for the first time with Vistara was a good experience.

### "the best among all"
Bengaluru to Ahmedabad. I have travelled a lot in last 2 years and have flown each of the Indian airlines, but Vistara is the best among all. For foreign travellers I recommend that if you want to travel within India, use this airline. The food was good, plus the aircraft was well maintained and clean.

### "hope they maintain that standard"
Kolkata to Delhi. I am a Platinum Member of their frequent flyer programme and have been so for two years now. Therefore my bias for this airline is obvious. Vistara is the only Indian domestic airline which offers Premium Economy. Same 3+3 layout as Economy but with more generous legroom. Their Economy seats have a pitch of 31" and recline of 3.5" except the cramped last row. The Premium Economy seats have a pitch of 33" and recline of 4.5". Those extra couple of inches does make a huge difference. Reached Kolkata airport at about 6 am for my 7.05 am flight to Delhi. Had checked in online the previous night. Being a Platinum Member they offer complimentary lounge access. However, as happens often, there never is time to pop into the lounge. Went straight through security and to the boarding gate. Vistara boarding is always an organised affair. I really can't put a finger on what they do different but there never is the kind of melee that you see around boarding gates of most other airlines. They started boarding at 6.24 am. We were bussed to a distant stand. Quite a few minutes of bus ride. To a very far stand beyond the old terminal building. Now, if I have one complain with Vistara and indeed with most other airlines, is that the first flight out of the day is always from a non-aerobridge stand. The planes that come in late on the previous night are parked at stands away from the terminal. Every airline that does that, seems to avoid the expenditure of getting the aircraft to an aerobridge gate for the first flight out the next morning. Instead they subject you to an uncomfortable crowded bus ride. Vistara also does the same. Boarding was quick and orderly. The welcoming cold towel (hot in winters) is always a nice touch. Then they handed over the breakfast menu. Another nice touch. A round of water. Boarding complete and doors close at 6.50 am, well before scheduled 7.05 am departure. Then the Government owned Kolkata Airport's inefficiency took over. It wasn't till 7.06 am that we were pushed back. And another 10 mins odd before we were airborne. 20/25 mins on the ground after doors closed? I don't know who is to be blamed. I always enjoy the new planes, nice clean interiors, comfortable seats, the rather different purple and gold colour scheme. Even the cabin crew wear a purple and gold uniform. I always see the lady cabin crews wearing a similar metallic gold watch and pearl ear studs which go very well with the purple uniform. Haven't seen any other airline standardising the accessories that go with the uniform. That's a real neat touch. 30 mins into the flight and it was breakfast time. Meals are always a pleasure on Vistara. I am a hardcore non vegetarian but could not resist the Sabudana Khicdi and Medu Vada in Sambhar that morning with Starbucks coffee. Awesome. We were over Delhi well in time but were then a victim to the usual early morning congestion that's routine at Delhi. Inspite of that we were on the ground a couple of minutes earlier than the scheduled 9.25 am arrival. Aerobridge connected quickly and I was off the aircraft at 9.34 am. Very happy. Vistara seems to be setting a new bench mark in Indian domestic aviation. I sure do hope they maintain that standard.

### "had a great experience"
Delhi to Kolkata. My first flight with Vistara and had a great experience. Supportive ground staff, frequent sms alerts about 20 minute delay, swift checkin, awesome evening snack (Paneer Tikka). Well trained and supportive cabin crew as well. I missed IFE system and would like to see Vistara implementing something quickly.

### "one of India' best airlines"
Delhi to Kochi. Must say this is one of India' best airlines, excellent service, good people and amazing flights! I have been using their services from a long time now. My dad had to travel on 10th may with Vistara from DEL-COk but because of an unforeseen event he was not able to travel. I called them and asked for refund for the tickets, they called me, followed up every time when i asked for a call back and processed refund within 7 days! Its service that matters and they are 10/10 every time!

### "Such a poor experience"
Such a poor experience! I flew Delhi to Chennai aboard UK835 on 8/4/18. First the flight was delayed for about an hour. Secondly, this airline is yet to be accommodated at the main airport, hence their flights land at a remote location, from where they stuff you in buses and get to the airport. Thirdly, drivers of these buses are ill mannered and untrained, despite it being very hot and supremely humid he refused to put the air conditioning on, despite all the passengers requesting, screaming and someone on the verge of fainting. Fourthly, delay in getting our luggage, it’s been over 40 minutes since we landed but no sign of our luggage! Never ever flying Vistara on this sector!

### "once again excellent"
Flight from Mumbai to Delhi return. Got to Mumbai airport and went to call for a wheelchair from the phone outside the airport - all airlines listed except Vistara. That was odd. Had to then send a reluctant guard to call someone with a wheelchair. After that the flight was smooth. Check in and boarding etc all okay. Flight on time and they served a nice snack. Return was good with the flight on time and the Vistara service once again excellent. The crew on board and service is very good. Also, they have the best coffee I have had on any Indian carrier!

### "received a personalised apology letter"
The only flight in India which cares for its customers. I was flying Amritsar to Mumbai with Vistara. The flight got delayed by 3 hours approximately. I received sms regularly notifying me that the flight was delayed. We were offered meals at the airport, one move to compensate for the delay caused by them, which if you are travelling by any other airline, won't even offer a glass of water or juice. After entering the flight, the decor amazed me. We were again offered an in-flight meal, both the meals were delicious. Until the flight got ready for departure, every passenger received a personalised apology letter and to make up for this we were offered 10% discount vouchers for our next travel. I am sure any other airline wouldn't have even apologised for any delay. After getting down at Mumbai, my luggage got swapped with another flyer, the immediate response of the ground staff was commendable, they traced the customer and immediately and got the bags exchanged.

### "Vistara highly recommended"
Varanasi to Delhi. Wonderful experience. I was informed on flight schedule on time. The plane interior is spacious, nice looking. The crew is kind and helpful. Food (vegetable pancake and chocolate muffin) was very delicious, in fact I didn't expect to get any food, so, that was a great surprise. All in all, Vistara highly recommended!

### "one of the best experiences"
Delhi to Ahmedabad. Had one of the best experiences. Comfortable seats, cordial staff and the most amazing breakfast served in flight. Three cheers to Vistara for this. Not only was the food tasty, but was served piping hot. Presentation was great and the cherry on the cake was the aromatic hot tea in the end. Loved it.

### "best inflight experience"
Cochin to New Delhi. Fabulous. The best inflight experience. Great food choices, well trained staff make the service a memorable trip for passengers. Keep going and keep shining. The best in India and kudos to the entire team.

### "in-flight service superb"
Flew Vistara for the first time during a recent visit to India from Cochi to Delhi. Not difficult to tell that Singapore Airlines is involved as a partner in this airline. Check-in, boarding, and in-flight service were all superb. Flight was on-time and bags reached the carousel before we did. vistara doesn't have as extensive a network as the other Indian airlines, but seem to be in expansion model. Great airline!

### "overall I was impressed"
First time flying with Vistara from Delhi to Bhubaneshwar, and overall I was impressed. The gentleman at check-in was extremely professional, courteous, and helpful, as were the rest of the staff. The aircraft was modern and clean. The only small downside on the whole flight was the fact that they run their own rewards program, rather than being integrated with existing international programs ie Flying Blue, or Star Alliance - hence after 15 flights so far this year, I have still only been credited with 13 of them.

### "a different experience altogether"
New Delhi to Mumbai. Flying with Vistara is a different experience altogether. Flying in UK963 from New Delhi to Mumbai was good. The staff was friendly. Even the flight attendants were helpful. Food option was both Veg and Non Veg servings. Local delicacies were served during the flight which is unique to Vistara. The plane was clean and tidy. The only con for the flight was a lack of In flight entertainment.

### "really wonderful flight"
Varanasi to Delhi. I had a really wonderful flight with Vistara. It was slightly more expensive than budget options, but offered a wonderful snack (a large samosa and a chocolate muffin), a cup of decent coffee, and a small water bottle, all for free. It was a bit unexpected and very delicious. All staff had great manners and I felt very comfortable, despite seats that were a little weak on cushioning. Would recommend.

### "cabin crew members were co-operative throughout"
Vistara, what a blessing in disguise. I was travelling with my infant daughter alone and this fact was taken note of right from the entry gate of Ranchi airport to exiting the gate of New Delhi Airport. The airport staff and cabin crew members were co-operative throughout. I am a frequent flyer, this has been the best I've experienced till now.

### "such nice experience"
Mumbai to Delhi. The food is included in fare with Vistara. It was Ekadasi from Hindu calendar, of course I follow this. Air hostess offered me khichdi food, after noticing that i told her that i can't eat khichdi. I believe that she understood that i don't want to eat Khichdi. So she offered me her food box, then i told her, today i can't eat rice in any form. She apologized & after some time some how she offered me some fruits & cookies to eat. Really appreciable for what she did on right time. I don't know whether airline trained air hostess for this or it was her initiative. Thanks to Vistara for such nice experience.

### Vistara customer review
Delhi to Mumbai. Vistara’s service is aimed at a premium overall appeal. The website interface is smooth, although the app could be better designed. Web check-in is smooth, and you don’t need to pay extra to pre-reserve a window/aisle seat of choice. Even spot check-in is easy, bag drops are always hassle free even in busy terminals like the T3 at New Delhi. The seats have comfortable leather. Leg and knee room is among the best, and you also get a coat hanger hook. However, no in-flight entertainment is a disappointment for a premium full-service airline. The food options are changing, and still remain decent. However, they were better when Vistara began, even though they still remain better than Jet Airways and Air India. The staff is very helpful and amiable, and  offer extra pillows and blankets. This was also the only domestic flight to offer a welcome drink in the Economy Class. Vistara is the best domestic airline in India in terms of quality, hospitality, cleanliness. The only thing really off-putting are the very few flights that they have right now even on popular routes, and the lacklustre Club Vistara membership programme.

### "Hats off for such amazing support"
My parents travelled this morning with Vistara from Hyderabad to Delhi with connection to London via a different airline. The connection time we had between two flights was only 1 and half hours and we were made aware that the luggage had to be collected in Delhi and then checked-in again in the other airlines to London. As my parents were travelling for the first time, they started panicking as they do not have enough time to collect the luggage, got to the other airline desk for check-in , immigration and to the gate. But Vistara Airlines helped and checked in the luggage in business class so their luggage would come first and they can collect immediately when they come out. They made my parents feel comfortable during that flight and arranged staff to assist them to reach the other flight on time with best support an airline can offer. Hats off to Team Vistara for such amazing support.

### "Overall it was good"
Delhi to Bagdogra. Boarding was quick. Cabin crew were very polite, helpful, and courteous. Food was alright. They offered bunch of drinks. All were non-alcoholic though. I wish the seats were better, considering it's premium economy. The aircraft looked like old. May be they have leased it from other airline or agency. Overall it was good, and will fly again.

### "Vistara weigh check in baggage"
Ahmedabad to Delhi. Vistara weigh check in baggage. My laptop trolley bag was 8kg and I was harassed to check in the luggage and not taking it by hand. I requested to their manager as well that this is the only bag and I have my laptop in bag, but of no use, they said either pay extra money or check in the baggage. Finally I have to take my laptop in my hand and check in the baggage. When tried to log in feedback at their site then their site doesn't take any feedback. Attached herewith the snapshot of the same. Never expected such an unprofessional behaviour from airlines like Vistara. Although I am a member of club Vistara as well, but still of no use.

### "best domestic flight experience"
Delhi to Pune. Vistara  might be new to market and so offering best services. They are not compromising on quality. Best inflight services, punctual, clean and comfortable. Staff take good care. Overall best domestic flight experience.

### "recommend to choose Vistara"
Delhi to Pune. It started with the best check in facility at New Delhi Metro Station with luggage as well. There was no rush at the counter. Vistara had best boarding service with the comfortable seats in Economy. They served food and their was a dessert called "Chocolate Fruit Triple" and that was the best dessert. When I told them the dessert was so yummy they offered me one more. Coming Best in every possible thing. I will recommend to choose Vistara for a great experience.

### "a good experience"
Hyderabad to Delhi. Ground Service at Hyderabad easy, no hassle check in, boarding was reasonable and was done in about 20 minutes from first call. Seat: 9A - no recline seat - ok for a short flight, decent legroom and cushioning. Not a fan of the Vistara colour scheme though. Cabin Crew were all very conscientious and courteous. I am impressed with the quality of their training and attention to detail. Catering: Vegetarian option. Quite average tasting, a little bland. Disembarking & Luggage: Smooth landing, 7-8 min to taxi to apron in DEL. Very long walk from aerobridge to luggage belt. Luggage was ready by the time I got to the belt. Overall a good experience and will fly again.

### "Vistara cancelled the flight"
I was scheduled to fly from Mumbai to Goa on 20 March 2017 for which I booked about five months in advance but just a week before departure, Vistara cancelled the flight. I was not provided with any other alternate flight so had to book about three days before departure and it cost me a bomb. On the contrary my parents flew from Delhi to Goa by SpiceJet in February. At that time too, SpiceJet cancelled the flight but they provided us with an alternate flight which was great on their part.

### "avoid travelling by Vistara"
I was scheduled to travel Vistara from Srinagar to Bangalore via Delhi. Flight 744 was departing Srinagar at 06.10 PM, reaching Delhi by 07.35 PM. The connecting flight from Delhi to Bangalore (811) was to depart at 06.45 AM the next day. My travel Booking was from Srinagar to Bangalore under a single PNR. But Srinagar ground staff gave me boarding passes to Delhi only. Added to that they booked the checked in baggages to Delhi only. They wanted me to collect the luggages at Delhi, do a fresh check in for Bangalore flight. They did not allow the transfer facility at Delhi. I was inconvinienced a lot. We were a senior citizen couple. Repeated request to the Ground staff and the airport Manager at Srinagar fell on deaf ears. In future, I would avoid travelling by Vistara.

### "preferred domestic airline"
Mumbai to Delhi. Vistara had been my preferred domestic airline for the past two years since I flew it for the first time. It's on time performance, new and clean aircraft, fantastic service, good food, etc has made it my favourite. The website and app is simple and user friendly. I am impressed with its frequent flyer programme where the points accrued seem to be more than other airlines. Staff are courteous and the systematic boarding gives a feel good factor right from the beginning of the journey. Food served is nice and hot. Leg space is good and arguably the best among domestic airlines. I hope that Vistara is able to increase its fleet size and fly to more number of sectors other than increasing the flights in the current sectors. Also hope that they continue with this wonderful service !

### "they should have IFE in premium economy"
Flew from New Delhi to Mumbai. This was the first time I have travelled with Vistara and I have to say I was very pleased. In my opinion this airline is undoubtedly the best in India. One thing I would like to point out is that they should have IFE in premium economy, so as there is a differentiation between economy, premium economy and business class.

### "we were warmly welcomed by the cabin crew"
Flew from Delhi to Mumbai with Vistara on an A320. The check-in was done very comfortably with no queues. While boarding the aircraft we were warmly welcomed by the cabin crew and always had had a smile on their faces which also kept on realising that we were on board a TATA Sons airline. The interior was fantastically decorated as well as well-maintained. The seats had a very soft cushioning which made us feel very comfortable. This was the first Indian airline whose seats were made up of leather. The legroom was also nice. The food tasted fantastic. I am very eager to fly Internationally with them. Overall a very pleasant and comfortable journey and also had a very fantastic experience.

### "wasn't greatest of experiences"
Ahmedabad to Delhi. I was looking forward to flying on Vistara but it wasn't the greatest of experiences. First of all the flight was brought forward although this was due to restrictions in Delhi rather than Vistara's fault. Then because I had paid using an international credit card upon checking they said they would have to verify it before they could issue my boarding pass! I have never encountered this before so had to wait for about 15 minutes before they came and gave it to me. The flight itself took off and arrived some 45 minutes behind schedule. Seating was better than on Jet Airways domestic economy and the food served was OK for a short journey. Vistara seem to be offering a good product but it wasn't quite the positive experience I was hoping for.

### "A high quality product"
Goa to Bombay in Business Class in an A320 in Jan 2017. A high quality product both on the ground and in the air. The aircraft are new, cabins and restrooms clean and well-maintained. The onboard staff provides excellent service. Special attention is paid to the food served (at least in Business Class). The menu card lists the calories of every item on offer. In my experience, Vistara is currently the best domestic airline in India, and by far. If inflight wifi is provided it would round off the package beautifully.

### "every aspect was faultless"
Bombay to Goa in Business Class in an A320. Every aspect of this flight from check-in to boarding to in-flight service to baggage retrieval was faultless. The staff are well-groomed, efficient and warm. The cabins are clean although somewhat spartan (that is, no wifi or monitors). And for short-haul flights the seats are comfortable. I was glad that my bags emerged first and quickly (I was the only passenger in Business Class).

### "combines luxury with comfort"
Mumbai to Kochi. Vistara combines luxury with comfort and is a wonderful airline. I was travelling in Premium Economy I was the only passenger in both the Premium Economy and Business class cabin. The meal was delicious and I enjoyed a comfy seat with neck pillows and extra leg-room. Just before landing the crew hand out a hot towel wipe. The flight was an on-time arrival and a warm good-bye by the crew..

### "meal options were nice"
I specifically chose their last departure from Delhi to Mumbai for various reasons, to check out the meal offerings and punctuality. The flight was ahead of schedule. The aircraft was the newest one and was clean. The boarding was done in a professional manner. Business, Premium Economy and then Economy. The seats are best in comfort especially if one is looking for a night flight. The meal options were nice and I loved the fact they were quite thoughtful as travellers prefer to have something light and not too spicy. The meal was accompanied with orange juice followed by coffee/tea service.

### "refreshingly great airline"
Delhi to Lucknow with Vistara. A refreshingly great airline to fly with. Smooth check in and boarding procedures at both airports. Short flights with a meal in a box which was not of that good quality. Flight attendants were helpful and warm. Seat pitch one of the best in the Indian skies. Clean cabins and great service. Highly recommended.

### "best 50 min flight i've taken"
Flew Vistara from Lucknow to Delhi in premium economy. It was a wonderful experience and definitely better than i've ever had on any 50 minutes flight previously. I have to say Vistara is better than the North American carriers i've flown with. They gave a hot / cold towel service and also coffe and tea run along with complimentry sandwiches, cookies, wipes etc. For me its the best airline and best 50 min flight i've ever taken.

### "would fly Vistara again"
Lucknow to Delhi. I flew Vistara for the first time and I was not disappointed.The website is easy to use and also they offer web check in and dont charge for seat selection. The food that was served was delicious, it was a short flight of 40 minutes so a snack box was served with an option of veg and non veg. All in all it was the best domestic flight I've had and would fly Vistara again.

### "crew friendly and welcoming"
Mumbai to Bangalore with Vistara. Friendly ground Staff, Cabin crew were friendly and welcoming. Cabin crew uniform isn't appealing to me. Departure was delayed by more than 30 mins and no announcing as to why it is delayed. Onboard meal is included in ticket price. I ordered Non Veg meal, It tasted below average. Better legroom definitely compared to other airlines.

### "a really bad experience"
Guwahati to Delhi with Vistara. Took a last minute flight so had to pay a lot but it wasn't a very good experience. The positives - decent ground staff, better than many airlines and leg space was better than regular low cost airline carriers. However, cabin staff couldn't speak proper English and forget smiling faces. Everything felt temporary. From the ground staff (outsourced) or the old leased planes. Food and beverages offered can extract a maximum value of 500INR on the ticket price. You could spend 500INR and get a much better meal in any of the other airline carriers. Their entire gameplay is premium but nothing spelt premium to me. At least in regular economy class. The flight was mid-afternoon and it became quite warm in the flight. Adding to the heat was the seats which were leather. We kept asking the flight attendants to reduce the temperature but to no avail. Basically, a really bad experience.

### "maintaining their higher standard"
Delhi to Lucknow. The seats and legroom in Economy is more than other indian airlines. It was a short 45-50 minute flight but we were served a snack box with juice, delicious sandwich with options of veg and non veg along with delicious cookies. Its been over a year that I have been travellin with them and they have been successfull in maintaining their higher standard and thats what makes them the new unique feeling of flying. I just hope they start streaming content to pax devices soon.

### "seats were unique and classy"
Lucknow to Delhi in Economy Class on Vistara. A320 aircraft. The seats were unique and classy with leather covers and beautiful colours and winged adjustable headrests which we normally don't see on other Indian cariers in domestic flights. This is what makes Vistara more comfortable and I would definately prefer them over all other airlines in India. For me at the moment they are the best after the exit of Kingfisher in the past. I just hope they stream IFE or get the screens installed either of them would be a considerable improvement.

### "it a wonderful experience"
This was my first time in Economy with Vistara flying from Lucknow to Delhi. The ground staff and boarding were excellent. The seats even in economy are all upholstered leather with winged adjustable headrests and the cabin smells good and was cleaned thoroughly before we boarded even given the short time the cleaning staff got to clean the aircraft. The cabin crew gave all pax a snack box with a juice, hot cutlet, chapati, cookies, face wipes, tomato ketchup and a bottle of water which was all very tasty. All in all it a wonderful experience. They lack IFE which I think should be added soon and should be a must once they go international.

### "I enjoyed my journey"
Lucknow to Pune via Delhi. I travelled with Vistara for the first time, booked economy ticket. Proper lunch and snacks were served, reading stuff was available. The staff was courteous and helpful. Overall, I enjoyed my journey, after hectic schedule at home while returning I find the flight quite comfortable. Being a economy flyer travelling this route frequently my experience with Vistara is best up till now compared to all others.

### "between 33-36 inch legroom"
Delhi to Lucknow in Premium Economy with dedicated check in, complimentary drinks, Priority boarding, pillows, Priority Baggage. Between 33-36 inch legroom and  the seats were leather with adjustable headrest. The meal was hot on this short 1 hour flight. And my baggage arrived right after business class and a person was at the belt taking off baggage and  helping us. They dont have IFE.

### "the product has been consistent"
Goa to Mumbai. Air Vistara aircraft are new with well-maintained interiors. Business Class product provides comfort and efficiency for flights shorter than 2 hours. In-flight service is outstanding as is the quality of food served. If there is one area for improvement it is that they don't yet provide wifi or any other form of entertainment. I have now flown Business Class on Vistara 3/4 times in the past year and the product has been consistent.

### "the food was amazing"
Lucknow to Delhi. I love the way the crew service and also the food was amazing. I was given a pre loaded tab with one way wifi in it and able to use WIFI phone streaming content to my phone directly. I can't wait for them to fly international.

### "best airline to fly in India"
Mumbai to Delhi. Excellent service, hot food, Clean cabins and seats. Courteous and well dressed staff. I found it the best airline to fly in India and I hope they go international soon. They must provide inflight entertainment or a USB port on each seat.

### "turned out a pleasant experience"
Delhi to Mumbai. Vistara turned out to be a pleasant experience for my first flight experience. I was booked on an Economy seat and contacted on the day prior to departure with an offer to purchase Premium Economy service at INR 3,000 per seat which was a good deal. Check-in staff at both New Delhi and Mumbai airports were efficient and warm. Very engaging staff members at the dedicated counter for Premium Economy passengers. 20kg checked in baggage and airline was quite generous with cabin baggage too. Luggage was tagged as 'Priority'. Premium Economy Passengers were invited to board through a dedicated lane at both airports. The fleet is maintained new, smells good and appears clean. Cabin crew were friendly, but like most Indian flight attendants they were too pre-occupied with their checks and service formalities and the graciousness of the flight attendants of Singapore Airlines was lacking. Nevertheless, the flight attendants seemed to be far ahead of their other Indian counterparts. Leg room in Premium Economy was definitely enhanced with what appeared to be a 35" seat pitch. No in-flight entertainment on board, yet. Their in-fight magazine indicated that wireless streaming of entertainment is scheduled to launch shortly. Ample and interesting reading material was available on board. In-flight service included warm towels and great food presented well. On arrival at both airports, it was interesting to note that all the bags that came out first had the Priority Tag on. They seem to take their Priority tag business very seriously. Vistara is an excellent product in the Regional Indian Market and they have all the makings of a Skytrax 4 to 5 Star rating. The airline makes their competition looking like a bunch of novices in the business.

### "my first experience was a good one"
Delhi to Mumbai with Vistara in Premium Economy. My first experience was a good one. Seats were very comfortable, meal was tasty, the staff were warm and helpful and the flight was punctual. I might move my priorities from Indigo to Vistara.

### "provides an excellent service"
Varanasi to Delhi, and was my second time in Vistara, and an amazing experience. I have to say that all are so calm and good to provide better services, prices are good not so high. Meals are perfect. Thanks to Vistara that provides such an excellent service.

### "I really liked everything"
Delhi to Mumbai with Vistara. After a long time, this was first time that I really liked everything in a flight. Starting from the moment I checked in to actual flight, everything was just fabulous. The hostess was outstanding, the way she served drinks, food, etc and then collected garbage - looking through the seats for missed paper glasses left a decent impression with my wife and I. A pat for all the Vistara crew.

### "wish other airlines learn from them"
Hyderabad to Delhi with Vistara. Excellent checkin, flight, comfort, food, service and attitude. Wish other airlines learn from them in India. I was sceptical at first not having any experience of them but we needn't have worried. Came to know later that it it jointly belongs to the Tatas and Singapore Airlines - two excellent brands. Wish them well and hope they fly to more destinations.

### "one of the best airlines in India"
Delhi to Lucknow was my second time flying with Vistara, and it is one of the best airlines in India in terms of quality of staff, seating and their on time performance. The  best food in the Indian skies I believe and I love their fresh menu with amazing cuisines. I just hope Vistara adds IFE screens in their airplanes soon which it lacks. Their magazine is not that bad either.

### "scores over other airlines"
Mumbai to Delhi, and I feel that Vistara is next in class. The seat space, service, food and staff. This airline scores over other airlines in India for domestic travel. The only issue is that it doesnt fly to much routes or I would fly them more. Truly an amazing experience.

### "Vistara was a good experience"
Goa to Mumbai, and Vistara was a good experience for travelling with family, No hassle check-in and good leg space, Flight crew was courteous and in flight meal was provided for even a short 1 hour travel. Definitely would like to travel with Vistara again and would recommend.

### "the journey was satisfactory"
Mumbai to Bengaluru. This was my third time flying with this airline, but this time my experience wasn't as good as I expected. The first was at the check-in where my luggage was overweight. I didn't mind paying but the charge per kg for excess luggage was quite high. The inflight service was very good, as the staff were very nice and friendly, and food served was delicious and was different from the last time I flew. Overall, the journey was satisfactory.

### "value for money"
Flew Vistara for the first time in February from Delhi to Mumbai. Amazing experience. Loved the new aircraft, food and service. Truly value for money. Surprised by the leg space in economy. Tasty food and served hot.

### "aircraft was new and fresh"
Bhubaneswar to Delhi with Vistara. I had booked this flight just 1 day eelier and I had got a pretty good deal. The aircraft was new and fresh. They initiated boarding process before time which was good to see, there was no rush. They offered a choice from vegetarian and non-vegetarian breakfast. There were variety of beverages available: Tea and Coffee after the breakfast. Business Service at a price of an economy seat. But the seat was not comfortable to the extent as was expected from a TATA brand. Still I recommend Vistara.

### Vistara customer review
Mumbai to Delhi with Vistara. I had booked this flight 20 hrs before my travel and I had got a pretty good deal. During check-in I was informed that I have been upgraded to Premium Economy, which was a delight. The aircraft was new and fresh. The boarding was so calm, as they had initiated boarding process before time which was good to see, there was no rush. The seat was comfortable. There were Two vegetarian and one non-vegetarian choice. I took the Oriental choice which was fab. Ras Malai and Green Salad were on the sides. There were variety of beverages available. Tea and Coffee after the meal. It was Business at a price of an economy seat. I recommend Vistara's Premium Economy.

### "serious value for money"
Bhubaneswar to Delhi, and I have flown Vistara thrice by now, and their service quality is consistently better than other airlines in India. Most importantly, their fares offer serious value for money and one does not mind paying a bit more than the domestic LCC fares for such quality!

### "welcome new full service"
Vistara flight from Delhi to Mumbai. Check in was very smooth with many open counters at Delhi T3. Flight was delayed 20 minutes and we were kept informed. Boarding very quick and efficient. Seats in economy seem better than most domestic carriers. Aircraft clean. Food served included a nice chicken with noodles, corn salad and dessert- quite nice. Tea/Coffee service after the meal. Pilot updates were frequent and the flight got in only 10 minutes late. Bags on belt as soon as we got there. Great experience and a welcome new full service carrier for India.

### "Great experience"
Vistara flight from Delhi to Mumbai. Check in was very smooth with many open counters at Delhi T3. Flight was delayed 20 minutes and we were kept informed. Boarding very quick and efficient. Seats in economy seem better than most domestic carriers. Aircraft clean. Food served included a nice chicken with noodles, corn salad and dessert- quite nice. Tea/Coffee service after the meal. Pilot updates were frequent and the flight got in only 10 minutes late. Bags on belt as soon as we got there. Great experience and a welcome new full service carrier for India.

### "one of the best airlines"
Bangalore to New Delhi with Vistara, and I was travelling with my husband. We had booked the tickets on premium economy, but to our surprise we were bumped up to business class. I have to say this it is one of the best airlines in India. I was quite impressed by their service, on the ground and in the air. Too bad they don't have a lounge yet.

### "definitely prefer Vistara"
Delhi to Bangalore flight UK889. The flight was delayed by 5 hours due to dense fog. It was supposed to take-off at 6:25 am, but we finally took-off at 11:35 am. At close to 7:30 am, they requested the customers to go to food court and have breakfast. It was just Dosa or Pudi. I was under impression that complimentary breakfast was over. Though, when we boarded the flight at 8:30, again they served the proper breakfast. The flight could not move by 9:30 as it was in queue. Again, close to 10:00 am they served Cookies and Juice. Though, the flight was delayed for 5 hours, crew member and staff made sure that people were always informed and server well. I will definitely prefer Vistara next time.

### "courteous staff and crew"
Mumbai to Delhi return and upgraded to Vistara premium economy on outbound (greater legroom, priority boarding, baggage first-out). By far the most courteous staff and crew, and the best in-flight catering on a domestic Indian flight. Spacious enough, and seats were not uncomfortable. Flights were delayed both times. They should roll out inflight entertainment, or cut fares.

### "with pleasing staff"
Mumbai to Delhi return on peak hour flights. Premium economy on the outbound, economy on the inbound. Flights were delayed, and had no in-flight entertainment. However, crew and ground staff are very courteous (one offered us an upgrade). Premium Economy gets you extra legroom, dining choices, priority boarding and deplaning, and baggage first-out, but unless they get their IFE act sorted, its not worth the price. Economy is regular, but with pleasing staff and good food (better so than Premium Economy). Again, at the price point, a little IFE and more baggage allowance should be included.

### "customer friendly airline"
Delhi to Mumbai. Vistara is a relatively a new airline which gives you a full-service carrier within Indian skies. Its services are good with good choice of food, attentive and helpful ground and inflight staff, clean aircraft with decent legroom. The only thing it lacks is the IFE which is not available. Overall, a customer friendly airline.

### "they do some things well"
Vistara is a new airline and they do some things well. There is good leg room, boarding is by seat number and works well. The food is so-so. However, I have taken the evening flight from Bangalore to Delhi three times, and it has been late each time. It appears to be a regular thing on this route, the staff is unconcerned and seem like they are used to it.

### "a refreshing experience"
This was a refreshing experience. Being Upgraded from Premium Economy to Business was a nice touch. The cabin crew in charge of business class were warm, friendly and professional. The seats were spacious and comfortable with a generous legroom. However, contrary to their website, no IFE tablets were distributed. But that is fine for a 40 minute flight. Welcome drinks were offered followed by a choice of two vegetarian and one non vegetarian meals. The dessert was delicious. Two oshiboris were distributed. Chocolates were given too. Impressive enough for a 40 minute flight.

### "smart, warm and efficient"
Flew Vistara in Business Class twice in the last month, from Mumbai to Goa and then back. The aircraft looked new, the cabins were spotless, and the seats very comfortable. The young ladies in charge of service were smart, warm and efficient. A welcome change from Jet Airways which has now become tired and jaded in every way.

### "best airline in India"
I flew Guwahati to Delhi return with Vistara in August 2015, and it is by far the best airline in India. The ground staff was efficient, the airline quality is very good. There was ample legspace onboard these aircraft. Vistara maintains the time efficiently and flights on time. A good value for money. Also the food is very good. Highly recommended.

### "strongly recommended"
It was my first trip with Vistara. I had 9 kg hand luggage weight though they allow me to take with me as handbag. Depart and arrival time was good. The cabin staff have a pleasing personality. The food was delicious, but they should change fare to as low as possible. Anyway, strongly recommended.

### "service was excellent
Mumbai to Delhi with Vistara. My check in process was done within a minute and staff was courteous. The flight announcement was clear and the boarding done in sequence. Onboard service was excellent, and the choice of food was good. They maintained temperatures of the food which was really excellent.

### Vistara customer review
My third Vistara flight and using Premium Economy this time. The fare difference was not much in comparison with Economy. At Ahmedabad there was a separate check-in for Premium Economy and luggage was tagged with Priority Tag. Boarding was sequential, though it was amusing that it was Business first, then economy and then Premium Economy. Water, cold towel and juice were offered. The seats are comfortable, and the seat pocket contents are stocked up with newspapers. The crew were warm and professional. There were food two choices for Veg and one for Non-Veg. The choices were well explained to the passenger. Vegetarian choices there were pepper paneer tikka pizza and cheese macaroni and for non-veg egg and chicken pastry accompanied with potato Vada with sweet and spiced Yoghurt dressing and Coffee Mousse. For a 1 hour Flight this was great.

### Vistara customer review
My flight on Vistara was the second day of operation in January 2015, from Mumbai to Ahmedabad on an A320. The flight was full in each of the cabins. Being a new carrier, the crew were very professional. The food was awesome including a chicken pizza/ vegetable wrap with pineapple bravorias and Mumbai jhurmuri chaat. Being a short 50 min sector they served a good meal. A great airline to fly.
