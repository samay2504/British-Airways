### “worst experience checking in”
Had the worst experience checking in. Almost got charged for 11kg over weight. Luckily a colleague overheard the guy and stopped him. My bags never got on the flight to Dubai. After several calls nobody can tell me where my bags are. International number given online is invalid, no response ons live chat on the website. 24h later and still no sign of my bags. Staff at Johannesburg airport was not helpful, staff at Cape Town hat no clue what was going on. So disappointed and in desperate need of medication in my bags.

### "a pleasant surprise"
Once again, I booked with LAM Air Mozambique, although this time the flight was operated by the South African carrier CEMAIR. It was actually a pleasant surprise, as I found the crew to be very friendly, professional, and concerned about keeping us informed and safe throughout the journey. The flight was short and was operated by a Canadair CRJ900, which is a second-hand aircraft, most likely purchased from Lufthansa as some of the information was written in German. The carry-on space is very limited, and I had to place my backpack under my seat, as I would have to check it in. They provided a snack box for free. The flight was very quick and basic. If I ever fly to South Africa again, I would give CEMAIR a chance.

### "I am not impressed with CemAir"
Not Verified |  Our Wednesday flight Kasane to JHB was cancelled on Monday and an alternative offer at an additional cost from Victoria Falls. Which we paid. That too was cancelled on Tuesday evening but no alternative offer even through we suggested that seats on a flight on Airlink were available on the Wednesday. The ticket office said they would take it up with senior management who was currently in a meeting and come back to us. We are still waiting. They came back to us on email offering total refund of the tickets but this would take a few days. We needed to get a connecting flight and we purchased tickets with Airlink. It just lucky that we had funds available. Needless to say I am not impressed with CemAir

### "Best flying experience ever"
I have never experienced such patience ever since I started travelling. I became late because as we got to the airport, my 3 year old son fell and injured himself and had to take care of him. The two ladies working at the boarding gate that afternoon called me twice to check up and make sure we got onto that flight and waited until the last minute before they closed check in. I was in awe of their patience and care for me as a passenger, this has never happened to me before, especially to go to the extent of calling me. Genuinely grateful and can never thank them enough. We need more of this kind of understanding with airlines. Best flying experience ever!

### "The worst customer service"
The worst customer service I have ever experienced! My flight was cancelled at 08:00 on the 16th of June 2023; Bloemfontein to Johannesburg. I consulted with Cemair staff to rebook the flight but they had no earlier running flights. I was in a panic because I had connecting flights to catch. Cemair staff was rude and indifferent. I still have not received my refund after paying for a flight that did not happen. After countless emails, which have been ignored, I am certain this is the worst airline available. Avoid at all costs.

### "a very decent experience"
A Tuesday evening flight. It was the cheapest compared to their competitors at such short notice (booked the ticket the Thursday before). If one can get past the aging interior and the +-25 year old aircraft (an average age for commercial aircraft in SA) it was a very decent experience. The ground staff was polite and helpful. The cabin crew was firm but polite and the onboard service included a complementary packet of crisps, a small chocolate and some sweets. The complementary beverage service was lovely as the drinks were poured in glass. I was entertained by a wine top-up upon request (I'm not sure if this is offered on all flights or whether I got lucky because it was the last flight of the day). Amazing leg room for tall passengers. One benefit of flying on a small airplane is the short wait for checked-in baggage on arrival. Expect a connecting bus to the terminal at larger airports. I would probably fly them again in the future, should their tickets stay competitive.

### "never use this company again"
Absolute scam, bought direct flights round trip for 8,000 ZAR and ended up with a connecting flight which was delayed. 5 hour delay. I will never use this company again
