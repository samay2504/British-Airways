### "not offer a Champagne in business class"
Hawaiian Airlines is an airline that appears to be confused about its place in the world and their business class product only adds to it. Even they don’t know what to call it – in some communications they refer to it as First Class but in other communications they call it Business Class. But in my view, the experience is neither. Hawaii is a bucket list or dream destination for many people, and it’s no longer the cheap beach holiday it might have been in the past. So, travelling to Hawaii is typically a cause for celebration for most people and what do you associate with a celebration – Champagne of course. So, does Hawaiian serve it in their business class cabin – no! Instead, they serve prosecco. What airline would choose not to offer a Champagne in business class on international flights, particularly one where its passengers are typically in a celebratory mood? Whoever made that decision should be fired because for passengers who pay to sit at the pointy end of an aircraft it’s a basic benchmark; just like you know your meal will be served with real cutlery not plastic knives and forks. Then, there is the poor excuse for a business class/premium lounge at the Honolulu International Airport. On the day of my departure, I could only see it from the outside because it was so overcrowded they had to stop access to anymore guests. From what it looked like from the outside, I think I was spared even more disappointment. Now, let’s talk about inflight catering. Again, what planet are they on? The airline has gone for meals inspired by the destination – Hawaii. They go as far as to say – ‘bring your appetite on board, because you're in for a treat!’. Boy – this is a clear case of misrepresentation and false advertising. Inbound and outbound the meals looked terrible and tasted just as bad. Grey coloured over salted soggy pork with a few greens and rice. But the kicker was the light meal served prior to arrival into Sydney. The choices where pumpkin with cheese sauce or pumpkin with cheese sauce. Whoever thought that one up is in need of serious help. The person sitting beside me an I just sat there lookling at the meal in disbelief. I understand Alaskan’s decision to buy Hawaiian was to get access to their aircraft and that makes a good deal of sense. But if they hope to grow the Hawaiian Airlines premium business, then they have their work cut out for them!

### "just how far Hawaiian has fallen"
For 20+ years I've been flying Hawaiian Airlines both from West Coast cities to the islands, and to the South Pacific on international routes. While some of their planes have traditionally been older, the service at the airport and onboard always differentiated the airlines. We recently flew first class round trip from PHX to OGG via HNL on the new 787s. Wonderful hard product, for certain that is now fully competitive with what other airlines offer on International service. But the soft product (customer service, food, beverage, etc.) is now awful. From the check-in experience, to the lounges to the in-flight service, it feels like no one wants to work at the airline anymore or cares about customers. It surprised my wife and I just how far Hawaiian has fallen in such a short time of being taken over by Alaska. I am always happy to pay for great service -- and thus I book and pay for full first class fares. But never again on this airline; it just isn't worth it.

### “catering on this flight was appalling”
The catering on this flight was appalling and an embarrassment to the airline. The passenger seated beside me and I both chose the pork belly as the main dish on the recommendation of the flight attendant. The salad entrée was a tiny portion and the ingredients bizarre. The main course looked terrible and tasted worse. The pork was fatty, grey in colour and over salted, the rice congealed and the broccoli cold. The red wine was served ice cold. The decision to serve prosecco rather than French Champagne given the flight experience is targeting holiday makers is baffling. The only snacks available were potato crisps and crackers. There was no choice with the pre-arrival meal and like the one on departure was inedible. The passenger beside me and I were never given a choice but simply given a ridiculous plate of roasted pumpkin with melted cheese.

### “Horrible experience with long lines”
Not Verified | Long lines and horrible if you are flying international using Hawaiian. Its even worse if you have to book a partner airline such as Japan Airlines. Horrible experience with long lines since you can't use the kiosk to check in your bag. If you plan on going to Japan I recommend a different airline because it was the worse experience I've had traveling internationally. The clunky website didn't allow me to select or change my seats and consistently just crashed. I had to go through Japan Airlines for a connecting flight to Okinawa. See picture below on the lines for checking in at HNL (Honolulu) and also for HND (Tokyo).

### "basically nonexistent customer service"
Short story, zippers were torn completely off of my bag and all of my stuff came out onto the carousel in an open plastic bin. Have yet to get help or compensation from Hawaiian. Still trying to figure out if stuff is missing. Hawaiians online customer service told me to contact Hawaiian through email about the bag, but I never heard back. Reached out 3 times. Eventually had to call and wait to speak to someone. Rep initially is unable to give me any info or answer any questions. Says they'll get back to me eventually and that they’re currently dealing with claims in October (it’s Jan 6th) and they weren’t sure how long the wait would be. Rep says I need to send photos which I had. They repeatedly accuse me of not sending photos or sending in the wrong format but eventually, suddenly sees them in my first email  and tell me it’s an issue with the bag. Not sure how two intact working zippers get torn completely from a bag during the flight and it’s a me and my bags problem. Rude, slow, unhelpful basically nonexistent customer service and the flight wasn’t great either. Highly recommend avoiding if you can

### "real bad both ways"
Our recent November flight from LAX to LIH was real bad both ways. Paid for upgraded seats and were forced to deal with uncomfortable jump seats. When we complained the attendants got really hostile with us, and we thought they were going to remove us from the aircraft, so we shut up and put up. The flight attendants were cocky and rude. This fact was shared with us onboard, "we're all real nervous about our benefits and seniority with the upcoming merger with Alaska Airlines", (this explains the hostility directed at customers), direct from an attendant sitting beside me in a jump seat. LAX to LIH was just as bad. Hawaiian Airlines doesn't event bother with airport terminal location signage at drop off points. The walk to the actual gate takes 30 minutes, with no prior warning. Its amazing this alone doesn't delay every flight. Won't be taking Hawaiian Airlines flight anywhere, anytime, good luck with salvaging anything after a merger.

### "I'm done with this airline"
Thought we scored with purchasing their gift cards that were discounted online but when we used them to purchase flights and later had to make changes the nightmare began. One would expect you would just receive the credits into your account to be used immediately to purchase different flights right? Nope, this ain't like Southwest. This process dragged on for months over numerous hours on the phone trying to change my flights and trying to talk to numerous managers. No one on phone had a clue on what the process is. I had to record every conversation and kept waiting for someone who knew to call me back. They never called me back so when I called again they told me the same thing. You won't believe how many times I had to listen to those 3 "Na Leo" Hawaiian songs on loop for their phone on-hold music. Eventually months later someone got back to me and able to change my flights. I'm done with this airline, even if they discounted their gift cards 50%.

### "complete lack of help"
Unfortunately, I booked this flight as a back up after a separate connecting flight got cancelled. While booking this flight online, the price changed from $380 to $500, this was my first issue. Today my connecting flight was further pushed back, so I had called to see if I can get on another flight. Hawaiian's affiliation with Alaskan airlines gave me confidence that this would not be a problem. To my dismay the assistance through this airline was no where near the level of Alaskan airlines, and I was basically told to throw away $500, from 3 different customer service representatives. Thanks for a sketchy booking and complete lack of help. I would not touch their services again with a 10 foot pole.

### "worst customer service ever"
It is unbelievable how Hawaiian airlines tries to search for a mistake I might have made, not even mentioning their behavior which is packed full off lies, mistakes, misbehavior and unprofessional handling of problems and not keeping any correct records. They were using the wrong document and not answering when I reported directly at the airport after arrival my damaged suitcase. When I was asking in January they had no case and I had to submit the document that was wrong chosen and filled out by their colleague and had to resend online as they did not have any documentation. Then they asked me to send in better resolution what I did on the 21st of Jan, and with excuses because of their again delayed answer I got mail on the 17th of Feb and answered on the 20th of Feb and them company confirmed that hey received my mail , that seemed to be disappeared by their records again, blaming me I have a mail issue, even though they confirmed receivement. Then after ages of trying getting you them on the phone, they say I did not send on the 20th. Then I had to contact another address, starting from scratch with the whole story and upload proof of answer on 20th of Feb and their confirmation mail. Then they say I did not claim directly after arrival. This kept on going back and forth until I was fed up by their resilience and ignorance and lies. What a poor evidence of worst customer service ever and avoidance of replacing what was damaged. Not Aloa just Adé and never again!! !

### "a terrible experience"
My family and I had a terrible experience on Flight HA459 from Honolulu to Seoul in October 2024. We paid $1800 per person for a one-way business class ticket, but my mother’s seat was broken—it was stuck in a partially reclined position and couldn’t be adjusted upright. She couldn’t sit properly for the entire 10-hour flight, and since the seat couldn’t fully recline either, she couldn’t lie down to rest. Imagine trying to sit in a plane for 10 hours, with the seat constantly shaking from turbulence, and no back support. My mother had to rely entirely on her core strength just to stay upright. It was physically exhausting and incredibly uncomfortable, leaving her with back pain after the flight. The flight attendants tried to fix the seat, but nothing worked. To make matters worse, a Korean-speaking flight attendant assured us we would be refunded for the broken seat, but after the flight, Hawaiian Airlines refused to offer any cash compensation. Instead, they gave us a useless travel voucher that expires in a year, despite us not having any travel plans within that time. It feels like the flight attendant deliberately lied to us just to avoid further complaints during the flight. This left us feeling deceived and extremely frustrated, adding insult to injury after such a terrible experience. Even worse, despite me being the one who suffered, they acted as if they were doing me a favor by throwing a voucher my way, which made the whole situation even more infuriating. Given the poor service, broken seat, and deceptive promises, I strongly advise against choosing Hawaiian Airlines, especially in business class. You’re paying for premium, but they’ll leave you with only frustration.

### "I will no longer fly Hawaiian"
Not Verified |  I normally travel Hawaiian Airlines from Sydney Australia to Honolulu, flying in the main cabin but Comfort Plus and always had great experiences. Went to book today to find out that all the niceties related to Hawaiian have been removed. ie no more 2 suitcases and additional fees ($100+) if your bag is over 23kg, Not even blankets, even on an overnight flight and other small but important things to the traveler. I was always happy to pay the premium price to fly with this airline but after looking at the options, such as Jetstar, unfortunately I will no longer fly Hawaiian, even with the Jetstar add ons. Sad but true. Plus, they used to fly direct from Brisbane, which made a difference to us with me being disabled but again no more. I think Ozzie’s will end up waking up unfortunately after they book, thinking they had the same benefits but alas no more.

### "Truly an excellent flight"
A near perfect flight. Very comfortable despite 2-2-2 seating. As a solo traveler I choose a middle aisle seat which is unfettered access and no one climbing over. The privacy divider is small but adequate. A full meal upon takeoff with two options plus a smaller one before landing also with options. Both meals were quite tasty and ample. The flight attendants were excellent combining true aloha with efficiency. The IPad entertainment system is clunky and with limited options but Hawaiian now has free Wi-Fi on most of their long haul aircraft so it’s not a big deal. Reception was excellent the entire flight. A short delay, due to a medical incident was made up for in the air. Truly an excellent flight.

### "Wonderful comfortable flight"
Wonderful comfortable flight with excellent gracious service provided by two attendants instead of the usual one on Delta American or United. Decent food and drinks. Good seat for 4%1/2 hrs. Free WiFi!

### "rarely been disappointed"
Not Verified |   I've flown on Hawaiian dozens of times, both inter-island and long-haul, and have rarely been disappointed. For a KOA-HNL round trip everything was just fine as usual: Punctual, friendly service, inflight refreshments fine considering it's a 40 minute flight, and no hassles. I wish they weren't quite so pricey, but Hawaiian has been habitually very reliable.

### "Horrible Experience"
Horrible Experience. They left me stranded in anther country. Had a round trip ticket for Auckland NZ. My flight home was scheduled on April 25th. I had confirmation #, flight details etc and my flight home disappeared! It simply did not exist when I arrived to the airport! They stopped flying to New Zealand while I was there! I did not receive any notification. I spent over $850 to get home on time for my father's funeral. They only offered me about half that amount. I have been waiting patiently for over 5 weeks for them to make this right before I decided to give them a bad review.

### "They lost a client"
Not Verified |   Be careful with their bait and switch credit card offers. Was given an in-flight promo code to receive 70,000 points after spending only one $1 within first 90 days. Applied for the card on their website, never saw a place to add the promo. Card was approved with a requirement to spend $2000 during the first 90 days. Immediately called the Barclays Bank provider and they said they could not take the promo after the card was approved. Poor customer service. So, I closed the card. After investigating around, here's what I found: If you apply from Hawaiian Airlines website https://www.hawaiianairlines.com you will NOT see a promo box. You have to go to https://www.myhawaiiancard.com to see a promo box before applying. It is the exact same application, but one does not provide a promo box. See the attached pictures. Deceitful credit card application design & careless customer service. They lost a client for life! And, their family, and their friends, and their influence group.

### "seats were uncomfortable"
Not Verified |   Terrible airline, clearly cares about shareholders more than customers. The plane was outdated with old 10 year old entertainment systems that was slow clunky and lacked features. The seats were uncomfortable small and worn beyond acceptable levels for an airline that should be proud of it's service and reputation. Food was terrible, a sandwich for dinner? They cannot compete with even the most basic foreign airline. The staff were excellent and smiling and definitely the backbone of this airline professional and courteous, but I feel sorry for them serving up such poor products on a run down derelict old plane they should be proud employees. I'd avoid Hawaiian airlines and Alaska airlines, two of the worst quality flights I've ever experienced.

### “the worst service airline”
Absolutely the worst service airline you can fly. Makes Spirit look like Emirates. No help when trying to change a flight other than “book it again and take it up with your insurance company” is what you’re told by the customer service manager. I will never fly this airline again simply due to the fact that you will get nowhere with the customer service team. Bought insurance to protect your flight and need to change a passengers name? Nope. You’ll have to eat the cost and book a totally new ticket and they will send the seat empty (Literally what the service manager told me was going to happen).

### “such an unprofessional flight crew”
Not Verified |  I have never flown with such an unprofessional flight crew. Also lack of food for the 10 hour flight We had a very small meal the first hour at about 2 pm. I saw water being offered about three times in the afternoon which was good. No afternoon tea or snack, meaning tea or coffee or cold drinks and nothing to eat at all. When I asked about dinner, the male host seemed quite irritated that I expected dinner. He said it was going to be a snack. It was a sandwich that came around about an hour and a half before landing which was about 6:30 pm. The staff had no class, more likely they should’ve been back in Hawaii in the Hawaiian shirts serving in a beachside bar normally hosts annd hostesses are very professional but these were quite the opposite. I actually told the hostess this was the worst airline I had ever travelled on. My partner flew from Hawaii to Sydney on another airline and in a 10 1/2 hour flight so they had two proper meals and then a snack during the day, I feel this is a very honest review with no exaggeration.

### "We have no other options"
Not Verified |   I am very disappointed with all of the players in line to serve Hawaiian Islands and most importantly Hawaiian Airlines. I've lived in Hawaii since 2018 and the price and quality of the interisland travel not only has jump dramatically in the last several years (its not a longer distance, there are no improvements, the gas prices are stable,  but the service is bad, everything is in addition to an already 500% increased price. We have no other options but to fly from Oahu to Maui, Hawaii and Kauai, the only ferries left are between Maui and Lanai and Molokai. I used to be able to go see my family at least 2-4 times a year. Now I cannot afford it at all. Why are the Hawaiian airlines so greedy? Yes go ahead and charge international/intracontinental passengers whatever you want, but don't cut our wings when trying to keep our families and community connected. This is a huge problem! Hawaiian Airlines have not improved on the quality of customer service, or the comfort of their passengers, neither the availability of food or drinks, and finally flight times (flights availability), yet their prices jumped from $48-$55/ round trip with Mokulele who was an extremely reliable, fast and comfortable commuter between islands, to $250-300 for a 20 min fight? it is absolutely appalling and is extremely damaging for the interisland business and communities. What is their problem acting like a discount airline, yet asking for TOP dollar. I believe Is because they can, no competition. It is ridiculous and we are stuck at their mercy. It is terrible for all of us locals..

### “Complete bait and switch”
Complete bait and switch. No pods. Open seats. No entertainment screen at seat. Worn out seat belt. Horrible. Demand 11 hour flight basically coach seat for first class no WiFi on board not even a tv screen. Complete ripoff my first and last time on this airline.

### “No help from anyone”
Not Verified | Horrific service. There was no sky cap, only one employee at the counter. We searched for first class check in, nothing. In horrible rain after leaving almost 4 hours early due to unforseen accidents and such they had nerve to say the cut off time for bags was 8:05 and as of now it just turned 8:07. I said what you have no employees where any other airline does are you serious. They wouldn't budge. We threw away a bag and my other friend was like no I can't throw all my stuff away. Horrible legacy to leave, rude employees I personally will never fly Hawaiian again in my life. No help from anyone just a trashy experience

### "Didn't try to hold flight"
Not Verified |   The airline kiosk broke down. They only had 2 employees one of which decided to have breaks while the line was out the door. We were already checked in but just needed to tag bags and go. There were other people behind us in same situation. The line took an hour just to drop off bags. We got to desk with 55 minutes for departure and they told us no. Told us we had to fly standby the following day. Can't help us with getting a room. No rental.car. No comps. And she didnt show an ounce of concern or willingness to help. Staff refused to give us her name to contact company with a report. She said she would write up her own report and we didnt need her name. We finally got her name from a manager. There was only 1 manager on duty to help. We had to wait long time for manager. Didn't try to hold flight for several paying customers in same situation. We had 2 young children. We had gotten the Hawaiian credit card for perks but now and canceling it.

### "Not a single complaint"
Short but pleasant ride inter island. Completely full plane boarded fairly efficiently. Great attendant in the front drink refills, done graciously. Not a single complaint.

### "delayed for almost 2 hours for no reason"
We took a flight from Los Angeles to Honolulu on November 29 at 7 am. My other group of friends used Delta airlines and departed at8am. Flight duration was the same l, however they landed way before us. Hawaiian Airlines used the weather as an excuse to land in Maui. How is that possible if my friends were right behind us and landed before us , something is not adding up. We were stuck in Maui for about an hour "refueling" might spend extra next time and use Delta. We were delayed for almost 2 hours for no reason.

### "service was very smooth and efficient"
Checking in at Tokyo's Haneda was very smooth despite my flying standby. Hawaiian does not have check in kiosks like they do back home but the JAL Staff manning the check-in counters were very quick and efficient. Going through Immigration and Security screening was quick, easy, and efficient. Having gone through NRT and HND, I definitely prefer HND. The flight aboard Hawaiian Airlines A332 was very smooth with some turbulence along the way. The cabin staff kept us informed and turned on the seat belt signs with the turbulence. Surprised that no announcements made from the cockpit throughout the flight. Cabin service was very smooth and efficient with the usual Aloha Spirit shown by each of the cabin attendants. Food was good, the entertainment system worked well with the exception of the inflight map which did not work at all. This was HA 864 11/9/2023. Very disappointed that the inflight map was not working on this particular aircraft. HA's A332's are excellent aircraft, but are starting to show their age. The lack of wi-fi is a definite minus. Hopefully things will improve with the arrival of their Boeing 787-9, although April 2024 is not soon enough. HA should work on getting wi-fi on board their A332's and A321's. All in all a great flight. Hoping Hawaiian Airlines Dreamliners will utilize 2-4-2 layout in economy, as with their partner Japan Airlines. JAL's Dreamliners have the roomiest and most comfortable economy I've ridden.

### "Made us feel so unimportant"
Not Verified |  So sad. I have never been downgraded in seat assignments. We came early to check in to get a middle row seat. Just before boarding they moved us to the way back, by the bathroom. Talked to the counter person, zero care. Said they moved everyone back to balance the plane. Made us feel so unimportant. Won't use this airline again.

### "think twice before flying with them again"
I am writing this review after an absolutely harrowing and frustrating experience on a recent flight with Hawaiian Airlines from Las Vegas to Honolulu. I am still in shock and disbelief over the terrifying incident that occurred during our trip. The flight started off poorly, with multiple delays that were poorly communicated. The departure time was continually pushed back. This caused a lot of unnecessary stress and confusion, and no explanation or apology was given for the inconvenience. Then, at the start if the flight, our plane was struck by lightning. The flight crew, although they tried to maintain calm, seemed just as shocked as we were. Upon landing, the communication from the airline was still lacking. There was no debriefing, no reassurances, and no explanation of what had occurred. It was as if they wanted to brush the whole incident under the rug. This lack of responsibility is unacceptable. However, I do want to express my gratitude to the pilot who managed to land the plane safely under such stressful conditions. His skill and professionalism in that moment were the only silver linings in this otherwise dismal experience. Despite this, I am extremely disappointed with Hawaiian Airlines. Our safety, both physical and emotional, should have been their utmost priority, but it felt like we were an afterthought. The inconvenience of the delay and the lack of apology for the lost day of our vacation only added to our dissatisfaction. I will think twice before flying with them again.

### "attendants were so grumpy"
Not Verified |  Would not recommend Hawaiian Airlines. Flight attendants were so grumpy. Their service was very unprofessional compared to some airlines I have flown with. One flight attendant didn’t give out the right amount of headsets/eye masks so we had to ask for an extra one. She did that with 4 other people who missed out on them too. The woman who served the food didn’t even know what was in the sandwich. Felt so uncomfortable around her and if I had to ask any questions I felt I couldn’t. Didn’t even say goodbye thank you for flying etc when we were getting off.

### "exhibited genuine Aloha spirit"
I just wanted to say that Flight Attendant Miley, based in Los Angeles, exhibited genuine Aloha spirit in our interactions. It is evident she thoroughly enjoys working her job, her coworkers and her customers, thank you Miley! You are amazing. Flight 34, Maui to Los Angeles.

### "feels like the economy of economy"
Being local, I am not proud to say that Hawaiian Airlines did not meet my requirements for being a good representative of Hawaii. I am sure no one is going to read this from Hawaiian Airlines but if they do. 1) The website is not good. I couldn't do online check-in, the website is slow and very "heavy". It's not intuitive and a lot of the links do not work. I am not sure if this is on purpose but just got to do better with the website. 2) In-flight service was not great. Food was subpar and the entertainment was again "heavy". However, most of all....the seats are horrible in Economy class. Not comfortable at all. It REALLY feels like the economy of economy. I thought Hawaiian would offer a little better than that. 3) Finally. I felt like I was being nickled and dimed for everything. I received multiple offers to upgrade, or had to pay extra for every little thing. It felt like an LCC. Not sure if Hawaiian is going through some financial problems, but as a customer it leaves a bad taste in the mouth when I keep getting asked if I want to BID to get a better seat. The Aloha is lacking. As a whole it was not really bad but compared to United, Delta, and Alaska, I was really disappointed with Hawaiian. I don't want to trash talk them. I was just very disappointed that my local airline was so junk compared to others. Especially since everything in Hawaii is so expensive. Unfortunately, as a customer, I will be avoiding Hawaiian when I can in favor of other carriers.

### "Poor customer support"
Poor customer support and indifferent counter agents. No ability to make changes to your flight online so you have to call in order to make changes to a reservation. Phone lines can be down so it can take several dialing attempts before you get through. In one particular instance, we needed to change our departure time (interisland) to a flight thirty minutes later and were told there would be a change fee equal to the cost of the ticket. When we asked for clarification on the unreasonably high charge, the customer service agent, who clearly was not based in Hawaii or the US, hung up on us. As someone who lives in Hawaii, we try to fly Southwest, which in comparison, charges no fees for ticket changes, allows you to make changes on their website, allows up to two pieces of luggage checked in for free, and has great customer service. Additionally, they jack up the rates of interisland flights when there are no competing flights. Not very aloha.

### "App crashes on a routine basis"
After first booking direct from SFO to OGG and back my flights were changed in a vague email that made no sense or didn’t seem to apply to me. No details were embedded in email and their App crashes on a routine basis. So instead of direct to Maui I need to go through Honolulu. Once arrived boarded for Maui but had engine troubles as we were then stuck in heat. For passengers going to Oahu to Seattle on this flight other arrangements were made and most of the plane disembarked. Another 10 minutes and remaining passengers were told to go to B2. No departure or arrival time provided. Went to B2 and gate attendant said we were now leaving out of gate A14 (next door to original departure gate). Even though there was a flight to Maui at 2:35pm we weren’t able to board that flight, and had to walk back to gate with no idea of said departure. Been traveling now for 10 hours and feel numb and pissed at idiot’s who are operating Hawaiian Airlines. If you have a mechanical issue they must have a procedure or practice to help the frustrations of passengers who are now getting on/off planes twice. What a bunch of idiots running this show.

### "Never flying with them again"
The return flight from Maui to Las Vegas was cancelled and I was rebooked on a different airline from Honolulu to Las Vegas. The problem, I have to pay for seats and check in baggage and Hawaiian Airlines could not do anything for me. I talk to a representative and they said they could not do anything for me at their end. The agent would or. Could not forward me to someone who could do something for me. I thought they would do something for the customer in good faith because they are the ones who change my reservations to United. Very disappointed in Hawaiian Airlines. Never flying with them again.

### "I will never fly Hawaiian Airlines again"
Not Verified |  We had booked 4 round trip tickets from Saturday to Saturday to Maui. Saturday morning when I check online to see if our flight was on time, I read that the flight had been cancelled. I called customer support to book another flight. The same flight, the next day was the next one available. Then the agent told me I had to pay for the flight on Sunday. I explained that I was booking the flight because the Saturday flight was cancelled. He would not listen, so I bought 4 more tickets. The following Saturday, I checked our returning flight and found that we were on standby, not reserved seats. This was after I had previously confirmed both flight. I could reserve the seats for $200 each. In other words, they extorted us for an additional $800. To add more insanity, the walk from the gate at LAX to the sidewalk is one mile. When I got home, I called my credit card company and had the charges I had made Saturday for the new flight cancelled. There was no dispute from Hawaiian Air, since what they had done is illegal. We visit Maui twice a year. I will never fly Hawaiian Airlines again!

### "lady behind the counter rudely started chirping"
Reason for leaving Hawaiian Airlines as a preferred carrier. In February of 2023, my wife and I decided to purchase tickets from Hawaii Airlines(HA) after learning our cat would only be allowed in the cabin on either Alaskan Airlines or Hawaiian Airlines. We had also made changes the year before placing this as one of our preferred airlines on our AMEX because we had used them a few times to go stateside. My wife felt unsettled in May with the ticket because it did not mention the cat on the ticket. So, she called the airlines to ensure our cat can fly in the cabin. She received confirmation and the cost for our cat Fred to fly. Post the conversation, she felt better about choosing HA as the preferred airline. On one occasion, we checked the HA webpage and noted they were changing their pet carrier dimensions. The pet carrier we owned prior was one inch larger, and since HA was making the changes effective June 2023, and we were flying until 20 July, we did not want to take any chances of having a tape measure come out and stop the cat from flying with us. So, we bought a new carrier to fit their new guidelines and started months in advance to get him acclimated to the new pet carrier. If you own pets, you understand this reason. Moves can be stressful enough on people, but when the animal does not have a place of refuge, it can be even more stressful. On the morning of 20 July, we went to the airport with eight bags and the cat. My wife was due to fly on HA 19 to San Diego, and I helped her move three bags containing all our clothes, along with our cat, into the Hawaiian Airlines departure terminal. My buddy then drove the kids and me to the Southwest terminal since NAVPTO could not get us on the same flight. I started unloading the truck, and I got a call from my wife crying, “They will not let Fred (cat) fly! They said he is too big and could not stand.” The cat was calm as a cucumber in his new kennel after a month of finally getting acclimated to it. We had one an inch bigger than the latest change HA made and my wife was just trying to get clarity. My buddy, who was dropping us off, brought his cat to Oahu two weeks prior from Sacramento on HA with a pet carrier which was the same as the one we chose to not use because of its size. So, we asked if he could get his carrier to fly with our cat. We also asked a friend to bring us their hard case pet carrier. Before their arrival, my wife went into the line and showed the bag turning on its side, unzips, and expands, allowing the cat to stand and just wanted to know if it would work. The lady said, "You cannot alter the carrier! my wife calmly explained, "It is not altering it; it is just unzipping the side. Again, the rude lady stated you cannot alter the bag and no this will not work. Shortly after this, our friend brought the hard case pet carrier to fly the cat in the belly of the aircraft. Then the HA associate stopped my wife because she had a reservation for the cat to fly in the cabin. My wife was trying to explain she's moving to California to another HA associate, and the lady behind the counter rudely started chirping, “She started crying, thinking I would change my mind!” Who says that in the service department of Hawaiian Airlines? Apparently, it was ok for this lady to do so, and she was allowed to escalate the situation, which my wife was just trying to find out how she could fly with the cat in the cabin or get the cat off the island. FRUSTRATED!

### "tells me I was bumped to standby"
Not Verified |  19 hours before flight couldn't check in online. Couldn't check in at kiosk. Counter rep tells me flight "might" be booked up. Gives me a boarding pass for a later departure (without informing me). I proceed to the initial gate Info from telescopes. Get to gate and my boarding pass doesn't work. They tell me I'm on plane for 6 hours later. I argue, they are calling my name, as I'm arguing and they are emailing me. I show my id, they tell me I'm on standby for a flight in 6 hours. They played me, gave my seat away right in front of me, said I checked in for the wrong flight, I explain the situation, and she tells me I was bumped to standby.

### "never use the airline again"
Not Verified |  I have used them 2 times previous to this and had no problems, but I was scheduled to fly with them this October going to Maui then to Kaui but due to the horrific sad and devastating situation in Maui we are not able to go there and decided to make our vacation to Kaui only. I had opened a credit card with them and one of the perks was to get a 1/2 off companion pass in which we used on our first reservation, when I went to rebook my flight not only did the price of my tickets more than double in price but they penalized us by taking away our companion pass saying we already used it on one reservation and now because we had to rebook we would lose it. I spoke to a supervisor who gave me the worst customer service I have ever had with a airlines and said there was nothing they could do about companion pass it was just gone. Hawaiian airlines could care less about there customers and will mess you over in a second. I do not recommend them and will never use the airline again as well canceling their credit card.

### "today was terrible"
Not Verified | I have been a loyal Hawaiian Airlines customer for over 30 years but today was terrible. I booked an interisland trip for my family 3 months in advance. I booked seats so my family could all sit together. Getting to Hilo was fine, everything went smooth no issues, which is why I always choose Hawaiian. However my flight home from Hilo was a joke. First off I went to the ticket counter to try and change my flight to am earlier one and the ticket agent wouldn't look up flights for me. He insisted that the only way I could change is by calling their call centre in the Philippines. I know this isn't true because they've done same day changes for me before with no issues. I decide to let it go and just keep our original flight. We come back a few hours later and the same guy changed my selected seats and had all of us, including my 3 year old daughter, sitting by separately. He took off his name tag so I didn't get his name. He wanted me to wait in line to be helped again. I couldn't wait another 20 mins so I went to the gate to fix this error. The guy at the gate desk Darryl was giving me attitude saying well it's only a short flight and infants cant sit in the 4th row because "there's an airbag. I've never heard this before and I don't care if the flight was 5 minutes long, my 3 year old daughter is not sitting be herself. So he begrudgingly sat me and my daughter together in the very last row and my wife and my other infant child sat somewhere else. If you want decent customer service look for another airline. I'd be willing to fly Southwest after this fiasco.

### "never fly with this airline again"
In my 50 years of flying this was my first trip with Hawaiian Airlines and it has been the worst experience ever. Started off with flight being cancelled to Kona, and needed to hang around airports until I got squeezed in somewhere. During this my seats I paid extra for were no longer assigned. On the way back my flight from Kona was cancelled and then the flight to Phoenix was cancelled. Again the seats I paid extra for were not assigned and then the luggage I had to pay for on-line when buying tickets had to be paid again, because, as explained to me, “the baggage fee is for a different flight”. They owe me money at this point, and I will never fly with this airline again.

### "Customer service is almost non-existent"
Hawaiian Airlines cares little for its passengers because the airline holds a virtual monopoly over interisland travel in Hawaii. Customer service is almost non-existent. Hawaiian recently "upgraded" its check-in process, and merely created a confusing, time-consuming, and frustrating opportunity for its personnel to show disregard for passengers. The contempt does not end there. Almost without exception (in fairness, there are a few good apples), every Hawaiian Airlines employee from check-in to departure treats passengers as inconveniences rather than as revenue-paying guests of the airline. It would not take much for Hawaiian to improve its outward face substantially.

### "Avoid unless you have a world of time to spare"
They canceled my flight last minute, which needs me to grab the last seat in the next flight. Still, they don't manage their boarding gate well and the flight needs to wait for an available boarding on the ground. Avoid this airline unless you have a world of time to spare. In comparison, flight experience and staff service are fair. But still, the airline makes side trips to another island in Hawaii very hard. Despite Hawaii being a holiday destination, the Hawaiian airline makes travelling in Hawaii a painful and stressful experience. Last thing to note: the Hawaiian airlines say that you can change your flight within Hawaii freely, that is not very true. Firstly, you cannot do it online, you can only by phone or in person at an airport. Second, if you have checked in luggage, you cannot change to an earlier flight. I am totally OK with additional fee for changing flight, but having unwritten rule for that is not OK for me.

### "Constant delays and cancellations"
Constant delays and cancellations with no recompense and shallow, “we’re sorry” texts and emails for extended delays. Delays and cancellations happen almost on a daily basis for this airline. If you can book via another carrier do so. Book another airline if possible.

### "no intention of making good on their voucher"
HA 26 from Honolulu to PDX on July 11, 2023 was severely delayed and I received a travel voucher. I was unable to apply it a few days later and called and they told me to wait 3-5 business days and try again. I tried again today, July 19 and was again not able to apply it. I then called again and they say they are still unable to apply it on their end. I asked to speak with someone above them and they said they could not even put me in line to talk to a manager due to high call volume. I am now suspicious they are just trying to get me to give up and have no intention of making good on their voucher. This review does not apply to any of the rating areas below and I've defaulted to using ground service, though my review is specifically regarding customer service, for which I give them a 1/5. Overall score of 2/10 reflects that I actually did make it home eventually.

### "flights delayed with no informative updates"
This is the third time we have flown Hawaiian and the last 2 times have been horrendous! Not only have the flights been delayed by many hours but with no informative updates! Both time seemed to be pilot and ground crew have not cleared flight yet. The first time we missed connection and staff were extremely unhelpful in helping us get another flight. In the end put us on a lesser value one with no compensation! This time we get a voucher for $12 which doesn’t even cover the cost of a sandwich. We are also obliged to stay the night in Honolulu because connecting flights aren’t until the next day, but by the time we get there it is a total waste of money. This is an airline I will never use again nor recommend to anyone!

### "avoid flying with airline "
Worst service / airline processes and experience ever. Flying back from Hilo (changed flight from Kona) to Sydney. Arrived at the airport over 2 hours early. Checked luggage… then had to wait for security. No mention when I checked that one of the machines was down and the wait was over 3.5 hours to get through the scanner… Meant missed flight, then missed connecting flight. To my surprise the “machine hadn’t just gone down”… it had been down for a few days. They could have prioritised it being fixed, text passengers to let them know arrive 4 hours ahead to allow time to get through security (due to only one bag scanner). They then also lost my luggage - which I later managed to track down a few days later thanks to the apple AirTag, not the Hawaiian staff who had no idea where it was. Only flew with Hawaiian to get points as a partner airline to Virgin Australia. Needed to do a claim for insurance on extra costs incurred from this issue (connecting flights and hotels not connected with this booking) extra costs included $500 - wrote in feedback and complaints several times to all channels and ZERO response. Points also never came through even though they had my number, submitted claim through virgin with details and to Hawaiian. Seriously most incompetent service at all levels. Seriously would avoid flying with airline this incompetent at basics.

### "unprofessional and unnecessary behavior"
This was first time flying with Hawaiian airlines. We had booked our ticket from Delta to go to Hawaii. Coming back we had use Hawaiian airlines to go to one island to another and connect to Lax. The gate agent was extremely rude to me and my kids. We were just standing and waiting for boarding on side and not in anyone’s way. She told us to go site down, i reply saying we are not in anyone’s way. She then said they will be calling the pre boarding and first class first. When I told her I am first class, she didn’t believe me and took the boarding pass out of d my hand to confirm. Once she confirmed she left us alone but this was unprofessional and unnecessary behavior on her side.

### "exceptional service"
Flew many times with Hawaiian between the islands and want to compliment the airline on exceptional service during at least 5 flights in May 2023. All the staff are genuinely customer focused, friendly, cheerful and enthusiastic about helping travelers. All staff members from Check in, Baggage Handling, Departure Lounges and Flight Attendants were always smiling, welcoming and pleasant to deal with. Such a refreshing change from most major airlines who can learn a lot from Hawaiian. They even give you a free welcome drink of juice or water! True Hawaiian hospitality - genuine and sincere. Mahalo Lui Noa Hawaiian and keep up the fantastic service. We will be back!

### "really carry the spirit of Aloha"
Hawaiian Airlines is really the airline to fly with between the Hawaiian islands. There was a hiccup on my experience but it was handled very well. Terminal 1 in Honolulu had been completely refurbished from the last time I had visited 10 years ago, and feels very modern, airy and welcoming, but less "island-style" - simple and relaxing, which is what the other airports around Hawaii feel like. Security took less than five minutes, and there was plenty of seating at our gate. I had two trips with Hawaiian, from Honolulu to Lihue/Kauai and Honolulu to Kahului/Maui. Both these flights are what I would describe as "up and down" flights, literally 3 minutes after we reached cruising altitude we already started our descent. One of the funniest things that I realised was that on both trips, the flights out of Honolulu was operated by the same aircraft (N483HA) and left from the same gate A19. When I asked the gate agent on my second trip about the aircraft's registration, I told her "I flew this exact plane and left from this exact gate to Kauai two months ago! She was extremely nice and joked that I should buy it, since it was "my plane. That really made my day. Onboard, even though these aircraft are around 20 years old, they did not feel too old, and the 2-3 seating configuration is great for couples and families. I definitely recommend choosing an A window seat when departing from Honolulu to get a great view of Waikiki beach. The seats themselves actually don't recline and have a small drinks tray - no way you could get any work on your laptop done. Considering the longest flights these planes do are 45 minutes, I don't see any issue with the bus-like seats. The surprising thing is that during these "up and down" flights, the flight attendants still come round and offer passengers water, juice or coffee, the latter only on morning flights. Even with the limited service due to the short flight time, I still had great interactions with the flight attendants. The return from Kahului/Maui was a bit of an issue, where all the flights that day got delayed due to a storm in Honolulu. I went to the check in counter to ask if they could rebook me onto an earlier flight, and I was rebooked at no extra charge. Hawaiian Airlines' operation has a lot of quick turnarounds giving very little leeway for delays, the knock on effects went on for hours. However given how quickly the agent was able to rebook me onto an earlier flight (and luckily I didn't end up in a middle seat) it shows that they can handle a crisis very well. Indeed the flight they had rebooked me onto was still delayed, but it meant I got into Honolulu an hour earlier than if I was still on my original flight. Overall, Hawaiian certainly excels in terms of its product, and beats other US regional carriers by miles. They really carry the spirit of Aloha onboard and I would definitely choose them over Southwest when flying Inter-Island, except if I needed to check any luggage.

### "structured incompetence"
Where to begin? First leg of flight initially delayed. That is not my complaint. Came in after supposed departure of connecting flight. Was told by gate agent to stand in line that would take at least an hour, while the connecting flight was still boarding but not told that! Found out by going to the gate instead of waiting in line. They let me on. All my bags did not make it however. Filed a claim at airport on Maui. Was provided a number that doesn't work. Still trying to reach a human and when I do they pass me off to another number that starts with thank you for your patience, but we are helping others and then plays music that is from WW2 cabaret with no response while asking me if I would like to participate in a survey after they don't help me. So here I am with 3 lost bags, no one to help track it down and no one at that airline is hired to care. It is structured incompetence, insensitive employees on an airline that has a monopoly on this island for most inter-island travel. Not sure what to do next as no human ever responds on their phone line, which is recorded for training persons. My best guess is they immediately fire anyone who actually helps! Poor people of Hawaii, so little choice in flying one or 2 islands over.

### "The worst experience ever"
Many flights were cancelled and delayed for hours without the clear communication. Info on airline website and Kona airport website was wrong. No updated info was provided. People has been waiting at gates for 5-10 hours. The worst experience ever. The board of airline should resign. I give 1 score because of employees at airline who have worked hard to solve the problems. Otherwise zero to the board of airline

### "Extremely dissatisfied and disappointed"
This is by far one of the worst experiences ever. Flight from Maui to LAX was scheduled at 12:40pm. When we arrived at the gate, we were told it was delayed. Then, we were moved to another gate. No one ever provided updates. We sat for hours to later find out the flight was canceled. No one from the airline came out to direct the passengers to next steps. Line for ticketing did not move. Luggage did not come out until 5 hours after the flight had been scheduled to take off. I had to book my own flight out for the next day and book a hotel, totalling $1,000+ for 3 people. This is an additional significant expense and hardship for my family. Who knows if and when I will ever be reimbursed. This airline needs to get it together and have a process for communicating to passengers what the process is in these situations. Extremely dissatisfied and disappointed. This was my first flight ever to Maui and first flight with Hawaiian and I'm not sure I'll use this airline ever again.

### "giving such a terrible experience"
Have been delayed over 5 hours due to stupid failure of system update at 9am. After the flight arrived then it said pilots are timeout and no pilots are coming. Messy communication and information at the airport No compensation, no food or coupon offered, no update of latest departure time. People are just unlimitedly waiting for nothing. It’s my first time to Hawaii from Asia. This airline messes up my schedule and ruins my trip. Thank you to Hawaii airline giving such a terrible experience.

### "We've been sitting for 85 minutes"
Just wanted to go from Hilo to Honolulu. Entire Hawaiian Airlines computer system went down, all flights grounded. After 3 hours they get computer system back online and we board our plane. Probably 20 open seats on our flight. They will not let us take off until every seat filled. Okay, no biggie, American Airlines can fill standby passengers instantly. Not Hawaiian Airlines, it's taken 5 to 10 minutes per standby passenger. We've been sitting for 85 minutes while I wrote this review filling standby passengers one by one and we still have more seats to fill. At this point I will miss my next reservation which isn't Hawaiian Airlines so they don't care.

### "very disappointed in the rude staff"
First flight in the morning was delayed 30 minutes now we will miss our connector flight. I am flying for work on this trip and am very disappointed in the rude staff and lack of customer service. Traveled with my wife 2 months ago and Hawaiian Airlines decided to move my flight up 2 hours earlier without notifying us. 20 people missed that flight due to the lack of communication from Hawaiian. We had to pay 600.00 to buy tickets on another carrier to get back home. I was also bumped on a flight last year in Seattle with Hawaiian, we have yet to get reimbursed for that transaction from Hawaiian Airlines. This is the worst experience I have ever seen from a airline company. Won’t fly with them again.

### "felt so helpless and disregarded"
Not Verified |  The flight was a connecting flight to Seattle, WA from Honolulu HNL connecting in Maui OGG. The Maui to Seattle flight was delayed by over 4 hours and we were not informed or notified in any manner. We had arrived from Honolulu and were waiting by the gate when we noticed the departure time change. I was traveling with my wife and 9 month old son and we did not expect this and didn't know what to do since this was our first time travelling with him. My wife went to inquire about the situation and was told by the manager/chief at the gate desk and they said "there is nothing we can do". She was worried because we did not have any baby food left or formula and it was frustrating. I went to speak to the same manager/chief and ask if we could get any assistance because we would have to sit in an airport with an infant for an additional 4 hours on top of the initial 2 hour of our flight. While I was talking to them they called security and threatened to get us thrown out of the airport because manager said she will not speak to us because "we could not understand even is she tried to explain it" I believe she was trying to imply we were incapable of understanding her and we need to move out of the way so she can help other customers. Shas just gotten another frustrated customer who was yelling and screaming at her and being hysterical but she gave her a completely different treatment and gave her another flight since she was from there and decided to flight out another time. We stood back and record while the security arrived and started questioning us. This was so frightening for us. We didnt know what was going to happen to us. Were we going to get arrested? were they going to take out infant son from us? what were we going to do in a place that is foreign to us and we did not know anyone there so thats where we were recording for our own safety. We decided to wait it out because it felt like the more inquiries or help we requested it was met with aggression and complete disregard of our infant child. We swore never to travel there ever again because we have never felt so helpless and disregarded and treated so poorly compared to others.

### "Disappointed and would not recommend"
Disappointed and would not recommend if you have a connecting flight. They will board the plane and make everyone wait until they fill in more seats before the plane is willing to take off. Held up the plane 30 minutes waiting for more passengers to be added resulting in unnecessary delays. Then sat on tarmac another 15 minutes. So inconsiderate for the passengers who count on the plane leaving on time.

### "stressful and unnecessary situation"
Not Verified |  This was such a stressful and unnecessary situation. My husband is Navy and we were stationed in Hawaii in February of this year. Hawaii has very strict pet laws, so while I got all that sorted, our cat lived with a friend on the mainland. I finally booked a flight with Hawaiian Airlines for May 5th for my friend to fly our cat out to be with us, and just to double check that I had all my ducks in a row, I called their customer service line. I went over everything with the representative on the phone, including asking her specifically if our cat was good to fly on this flight and she said yes. I even offered to pay for the ticket ahead of time, which is insane that they don't let you do that, it is first come first serve since they only allow 4 pets on the plane at a time. We get off the phone and I am content that I did everything I was supposed to. My friend drives an hour and a half to Atlanta airport, gets there at 3:30am for her 6am flight, and the front desk denies a ticket to our cat. All they can tell us is that there is an error in their system and they cannot book her a ticket. They were incredibly incompetent. I was on the phone with her the whole time listening. They were rude to my friend and told her to just go the gate without a ticket for our cat! They held her up so much that she had to run from the train to her gate, and then come to find out they had the wrong gate printed on her ticket so she missed the flight anyway! We got on the phone with customer service and mind you, it's 11pm where we are. We then spend the next hour explaining what just happened and asking Hawaiian to fix it, and eventually they get us to a very nice manager named Joyce who helped us schedule another flight for the same day at 10:35am. Time comes for our friend to buy the ticket for our cat for the new flight, and the same problem happens. It took another hour for us to get a straight answer from front desk; Hawaiian Airlines had booked both flights with JetBlue as the first leg of the flight, and Hawaiian Airlines does NOT allow connecting flights with other airlines to carry pets. You'd think a manager on the customer service line might know that before booking our tickets and wasting more of our time. So if she had made it to the gate in time, they still would have turned our cat away. At that point we told our friend to just go home. My husband stayed up until 8am on the phone with their customer service trying to get them to fix us another flight for the next day, but they told us the only way they could do it is if we purchased two separate round trips and arranged for the times to line up. There are no nonstop flights to Hawaii that allow pets that fly out of Atlanta, so she would have had to stop in Seattle. There are so many risks involved in buying tickets that way, not to mention possible delays, going back through TSA when she lands in Seattle and the fact we did not want our cat in a carrier for that long. In the end we just asked for a refund. They gave us an additional $70 (whoopie) for wasted time, and apologized for the "miscommunication". We are booking another flight with Alaska Airlines instead. I was devastated, sobbing in the middle of the night because I have been so stressed out planning this for months , and they ruined it in the last hour. Never ever using them again. Only giving two stars because Joyce was so kind and apologetic to us.

### "Delays and lies"
Not Verified | Delays and lies: First we are told there is a 1 hour delay but for some reason they board us anyway. We wait in the plane for 2 hrs, with the excuse being that they are waiting on a part that needs to be shipped to Maui. Finally they deplane us, and lie to us saying that they need to install said part now - so first it was that the part needed to be shipped, and now it needs to be installed? Will we get to Maui today? Probably not, and I’m assuming a few more lies every hour or two while we sit in the terminal twiddling our thumbs. NOT RECOMMENDED - spend the extra cash for a more reliable, trustworthy airline.

### "level-headed and kept smiling"
Just wanted to recognize our HA agent at gate A14 this morning for keeping his cool and being so friendly and helpful even though today was very stressful as flight cancellations from yesterday rolled over to this morning causing all kinds of chaos. No matter how sassy and rude some people were, he stayed level-headed and kept smiling while trying to accommodate everyone that he could. Mahalo! I saw you and I appreciate you! !

### "extremely disappointed"
Not Verified | I’m writing to express my extreme disappointment with the level of service that I received from your airline. I recently made a reservation with your airline for a flight less than 24 hours. Unfortunately, due to circumstances, I was unable to fix my seat arrangements. I reached out to your customer service team for assistance, hoping to help me with this issue. However, I was extremely disappointed with the response that I received. Despite my explaining the urgency of my situation, your representative informed me that Hawaiian Airlines was not able to help me with my reservation as it was made less than 24 hours ago. This is a policy that was not clearly communicated when I made the reservation. I find this policy to be unfair and unreasonable. As a loyal customer of Hawaiian Airlines, I had hoped that you would be more understanding and accommodating of my situation. I am disappointed that your airline was not able to provide me with the assistance I needed during this difficult time.

### "Flights delayed daily and customer service rude"
The airline app doesn’t work correctly any more. Flights delayed daily and customer service rude! Then I tried to call to book, a 45 minute wait time quoted. I fly for work and am on the clock. I need things to be quick and smooth when I have to fly. I usually book my flight on the app on the way to the airport. Now I have to input every piece of information including my Hawaiian number! It’s no longer considered an island hop people. So if you got to go plan a whole day! I even tried to chat and been on read with no representative to answer me. Been 20 minutes.

### "experienced delays and cancelled flights"
Not Verified |  I have been flying for over 20 years and have never experienced the level of frustration I received from poor planning and poor performance of Hawaiian Airlines. We experienced delays and cancelled flights over multiple days. Now if I saw improvement in the results this would absolutely be a different review, but somehow Hawaiian Airlines managed to have the exact same issue on the exact same flights over multiple days! Being in operations where I work, if I see a problem once I try to make corrections. That fact that Hawaiian Airlines has the same exact problem 3 days in a row and doesn’t try to make any corrections just blows my mind. Good luck to you if you travel with Hawaiian Airlines.

### "Passive aggressive and rude flight attendants"
Not Verified |  Passive aggressive and rude flight attendants. Watched one get into a verbal altercation with a passenger, and behave in a smug manner after. Had another flight attendant talk rudely to me and give me attitude over my mothers RLS, which is incredibly unheard of and unprofessional. Low class behavior, made us feel like we are “annoying tourists” instead of people paying to have a nice vacation. Not returning to HA or Hawai’i, would rather spend my time and money somewhere people don’t make me feel like a stupid haole. Oh yeah and the food sucks, they fed us a cheese stick covered in bread. Nope bye.

### "do not recommend"
Buyer beware. I purposely booked air and hotel travel package through the Hawaiian airlines website, but it turns out it actually went through Expedia without my knowledge. Several issues: website had the option selected to pick seats (that was a lie). Received a pop-up message I could pick seats after booking, (another lie). I never received a confirmation email, and had to call in to get a confirmation the day before the flight. When I called in to get the confirmation I was told that I did not book through the airline website. They said I booked through Expedia. I was never able to pick my seats and flying with kids makes it very stressful not knowing where everyone is sitting. The gate agent apparently picks your seats for you. They will however offer to sell you upgraded seats which is pretty greasy. Staff are extremely rude and not very helpful. Seats were uncomfortable and the inflight entertainment system was broken and no WiFi. Very expensive checked bag fees, you pay for all checked bags. Pretty much everything about this airline is bad. 0/10 do not recommend.

### "total melt down today"
Hawaiian customer service total melt down today. After arriving two hours early for flight we were told there would be a delay in flight. About 1 hour before a 9:45 am flight we were told the flight would be leaving at 6:00 pm. We found an alternate route to Maui via Southwest. Hawaiian air customer service could provide no information on what kind of compensation we would receive. They had no clue of how to assist us with other routes we could take. When we had a lay over in San Jose we found out the flight was canceled. We called customer service to find out what would happen with our bags as we would be in Maui already. They could provide no information about our luggage and how it would be handled, and still no information about compensation. Total customer service melt down. Will be waiting in Maui for luggage and compensation. Not happy with Hawaiian Air.

### "Thanks for making a stressful travel day"
So my ticket was zone 3 Priority. My question was will they call a priority line to board or is it just zone 3. This agent yelled at me telling me my ticket says zone 3 over there! (I can read and write) I follow up with, it also says priority boarding so I’m just asking to make sure I board with the right group or doesn’t really mean anything? Zone 3 over there in an unnecessary loud yelling pitch once more. There is no reason to yell at any passenger. She has the wrong temperament for her job. I was Embarrassed and boarded my flight very upset in Hawaii of all places. Then, There were issues with plane and we were boarded and de-boarded 2x so we had to stand in line. Just my luck we get her again. Patiently waiting, finally our turn, We wait to be summoned to approach her desk after watching her handle all people before us just fine. She looks up and say do y’all have a question or what? After standing in line all that time, yes we have questions and and need a connection flight issues. She told us she doesn’t know anything we don’t have any option and just to sit tight, sorry. For Another 6 hours. This has been the rudest experience I’ve encountered and added unnecessary stress to a stressful travel day on their part. Now if I would have conducted my self with the same volume and shortness reminding her that I’m not a child. Don’t yell at me I’m standing right here, they would not allow me to board their plane. So I have to take the mistreatment and deal with it after spending my money with this airlines. And I'm sitting here looking at her in her computer helping every guest after me. She didn’t even look at anything in the computer to me! I love coming to Maui. We come every year and this is my first time flying with Hawaiian Airlines (Honolulu was my transfer flight) Never Again. Thanks for making a stressful travel day with Hawaiian airlines more uncomfortable and have me sitting here angry instead of relaxing to get through this next 6 hours in the airport. They announced they were helping with connecting flights over the speaker yet at her desk she advises calling the airline my ticket is with. So why did I stand in line 45 mins at 1 am.

### "incompetence of Hawaiian Airlines agents"
Not Verified |  Hello, it's a shame for my flight of March 13 at 12:01 Honolulu - San Diego, I show up with my confirmed flight boarding pass seat 14D and despite all that, I am told that the flight is full that I had to take the next flight without apologies or compensation nothing just take the next day's flight at 10:55 the HA58 was also delayed. I went back to Waikiki to take a hotel, I missed my car rental in San Diego, I also paid for the hotel night of March 13 in San Diego for nothing, round trip transportation Waikiki Honolulu airport, j paid more than $250 for the incompetence of Hawaiian Airlines agents. Bonjour, c’est une honte pour mon vol du 13 mars à 12h01 Honolulu - San Diego, je me présente avec mon vol confirmé boarding pass siege 14D et malgré tout ça, on m’annonce que le vol est complet qu’il fallait prendre le prochain vol sans excuses ni indemnités rien juste prendre le vol du lendemain à 10h55 le HA58 a son tour aussi retardé. Je suis retourné à Waikiki prendre un hôtel, j’ai raté ma location de voiture sur San Diego, j’ai payé aussi payé la nuit d’hôtel du 13 mars à San Diego pour rien, le transport aller retour Waikiki aéroport Honolulu, j’ai payé plus de 250$ pour l’incompétence des agents Haiwaiin airlines

### "does nothing to help their customers"
Not Verified |  The flight was good, departing and arriving on time. After the HA flight we boarded a flight on another carrier to Michigan, where we found out our luggage hadn't arrived. I called Hawaiian Air and was told by their customer service that it's the airports concern and I need to call there. As I've not experienced this before I followed their direction and after several attempts, reached the lost and found at Honolulu airport, who told me it is not their responsibility and I have to talk with the airline. I went back to Hawaiian Air and was once again told it's not their responsibility and I have to contact the airport. I now resisted this and shared what the airport had told me but the customer service rep was adamant that they don't help with lost luggage. I went back and forth to both parties one more time before filing a police report and filing a complaint with the FAA. If you take the time to read thru the FAA guidelines it is clearly the airlines responsibility to assist with lost luggage, but Hawaiian Air does nothing to help their customers with this. I was going to sign up for their credit card and intend to use them more often, but I will now do what I can to stay away from them.

### "they treat me like the low class"
I took advantage of the low fare that Hawaiian Airlines offered and then they treat me like the low class that the ticket represents. I had to check my own bags but I couldn't select my own seat. No one is available to help you check your bags because all the agents are standing at the boarding gate and sorting out the seating arrangement for the low budget flyers ... and that's how they assign their staff time. You then board in group 6 and scrap for baggage space in the overhead bins. You get what you pay for and you are treated like it too. Only positive of the trip was the movie selection, after you pay $4 for earbuds.

### "big change in quality"
Not Verified | Hawaiian Airlines used to be good; known for its friendly service and flexible reservations. However, I notice a big change in quality. The reservations person on the phone said that we could get a credit on a ticket we had to change but when I called to make reservations they did not honor the ticket. The staff also made us wait 3 hours on the plane due to plane problems. When I alerted them that they needed to allow us to get off the plane after 3 hours according to Federal guidelines, they got upset. No food or water during the wait. Poor service too.

### "refuse to honor a travel voucher"
Not Verified | They refuse to honor a valid travel voucher that they issued. Don't ever accept one for a reservation or seat change. I emailed customer service and spoke to three different people and none were able to or willing to help. The voucher doesn't expire until July 2023.

### "shockingly poor experience"
Not Verified |  Really shockingly poor experience! Our flight out of Maui was delayed and we ended up missing our connection to Lihue. There was no text notification (like we routinely get with Delta), and the PA announcements don't reach outside the immediate gate area so we didn't hear the page. They got us on another flight, assuring us that the last flight of the day usually waits on folks connecting. We relied on that, but our flight to Lihue did not wait the extra 10 minutes and we were left in Honolulu. They put us up in a seedy "hotel" I wouldn't board my dog in (room smelled like a dirty bathroom). Staff on board and in Honolulu could not have cared less, and frankly, I'll take less smiling and "mahalo" for efficient customer service.

### "Service quality is bad"
Not Verified |  Service quality is bad, found attendants to be rude in nature. Food choice for vegetarians does not exist and hostess will make no attempt to provide you with alternative. Web checkin - tried at all times thinking may be server is busy but alas no success.. Entertainment unit is hit or miss. Headphones provided are not so good and did not work when connected to infotainment. Overall seat size seemed smaller than other airlines.

### "Hawaiian Airlines, never again"
Pros: Cheap business class tickets. Cons: You get what you pay for! But I learned my lesson the hard way! Cabin Staff service needs to be much better for first/business class. Please stop calling it Champagne when you are serving prosecco! Ground service Horrible in JFK. I had extra baggage and needed to pay for it. It took four staff 35 minutes to process the payment after being passed on to three different check-in desks. Not a word of apology or regret for having me wait for 35 minutes because they did not know how to do their job! My flight was from JFK to KIX with a night stop in HNL  which I did not ask for). I was told they would not through check my luggage to KIX. I had to retrieve all my six bags in HNL, they do not have storage in Terminal 1. Have to drag luggage all the way to Terminal 2, and it's 20$ a piece for overnight storage. Fellow passengers came to my aid with the difficulty in handling my luggage at HNL but the Hawaiian Airlines staff just shrugged it off despite asking for help. The next day when checking in for my flight to KIX at HNL was told I needed to pay for extra bags again but eventually did not have to after some back-and-forth discussions. For Inflight entertainment, ipads are handed out with not much entertainment in them! The business class lounge was full in HNL with a large majority being Priority Pass members so I had to use one downstairs. the choice of snacks and beverages were unimpressive, when I finally made it on my second go. Hotels are not offered by the airline for the night stop in HNL! Moral of the story: Hawaiian Airlines, never again!

### "worst service I’ve ever had"
It was the worst service I’ve ever had! First they delayed my flight for 6 hours. Then at the airport the delayed a flight again for 1 more hour and said that our plain is coming from Vegas. Very nice and good to know, do they give trouble to plan a time? Others flight to Hawaii with other airlines didn’t get canceled! So disrespectful! I will never buy them again.

### "never be relying on Hawaiian again"
I’m very disappointed and upset. My husband and I bought round trip tickets to Hawaii and returning to San Francisco in February. The flight to Hawaii was great as always but on the return flight the day before I tried to check us in and it turns out that Hawaiian Airlines canceled our flight tickets - why ? I have no idea. I called Expedia because that’s who we booked with for our vacation package and they said the airline canceled us and that we would get refunded by them (Hawaiian Airlines). We were left with no flight and it was up to us to look for 2 flight tickets so we could go home. 24 hour before our return really? This is so upsetting because the flight was not even canceled it was just our tickets. Ended up spending more money, missing work and not returning home until 2 days after. I’m still waiting for my refund and till this day I don’t know why this happened when I booked and paid 6 months ahead. I will never be relying on Hawaiian Airlines again!

### "will not book again"
Not Verified |  Hawaiian Airlines changed my flight and lengthened my layover by 2 hours. When I called to change the flight to closer to what I originally booked and paid for I was told it was too late and I was misunderstanding. I have never had an airline customer service experience like this one where I was blamed for a schedule change on their end. Do not recommend this airline and will not book again.

### "Very good experience"
Not Verified |  Very good experience. Except for the 2-2-2 configuration this was a world class business class trip. Good food, drinks and friendly staff. On time departure and early arrival. Only minuses, no wi fi and limited choice of entertainment. Aircraft was old but well maintained.

### "You could not pay me to take one of their flights"
Not Verified |  I have been traveling for 30 years and can't express with words just how bad my experiences with Hawaiian Airlines have been. My wife and I have traveled to Hawaii every January for the past 15 years and every year I contemplate hiring a boat to take me from island to island rather than dealing with this lousy airline. My most recent experience, I had booked two one-way tickets (Maui - Kona and Kona - Honolulu). My plans changed and I only needed the Kona to Honolulu portion of the trip. Rather than being able to make this change online I used chat, text and three phone calls. After more than 2 hours, I was told by the agent that I had to cancel this ticket and then rebook it completely. I said, ok and asked the agent to rebook the flight for me. I was then told that they couldn't rebook it, but I had to use the credit voucher online. After waiting 48 hours, and no credit voucher appearing in email, I logged in and tried to find the credit. Another two hours of waiting for a chat agent, only to be told that I couldn't book this online and had to speak with an agent. Ok, I call the number....90 minutes later, I'm told that "because I called an agent, they were going to charge me $25 for each ticket for a processing fee. So, my ticket that had a value of $116 per person, and I was trying to rebook a new ticket for $39, and I was going to immediately lose the remaining value of the credit, was really only saving me $14 off of just abandoning the original ticket and rebooking online. I've never heard of anything so ridiculous in all my years of traveling. Unfortunately, they have a monopoly when it comes to inter-island travel so you have to use them which I guess is why they can get away with providing such lousy service. You literally could not pay me to take one of their flights out of the Hawaiian islands to their mainland or Asia destinations.

### "This is not 1980 Hawaiian Airlines!"
Horrific App/website experience that led to calls with a physical agent for 75 minutes on the phone trying to book extra people on the plane. If I didn’t call the seats wouldn’t have been confirmed (we didn’t know this) even though they charged us already. They wanted us to fax a statement over stating the booking was paid for and then call them back to confirm (going through the “system” takes a while to begin with. This is not 1980 Hawaiian Airlines! I won’t be using this airline anymore and I implore you not to either unless you want to spend your pre vacation stressed and hot under the collar!

### "given random seats and not together"
Not Verified |  When I had initially purchased my flight for my fiance' and I, I paid the extra fee for us to pick our seats, to sit together. Day of departure from Sacramento, we no longer had seats assignments. Furthermore, the in flight entertainment and wifi, never worked. The day we are due to fly back to Sacramento from Honolulu, again we lost our seats we picked when purchasing our tickets. We were given random seats and not together. Waited for over 30 minutes before they had an agent at the gate for help. Still we waited another 45 minutes

### "you had to pay for everything"
Not Verified |  I missed my first flight due to their electronic check in system not working and having to wait in the customer service for an hour and a half. The next day Waited for 2 hours just to get our new boarding pass. They tried to charge me $100 just to sit with my wife. At each section in the airport they had one to two people working with up to 50 customers waiting for help. Once we got to the gate they were hostile and undermanned. We tried asking questions about our seats and they told us to ask after they started boarding everyone. Once in the air they brought a food cart that you had to pay for everything, then after that you could get free drinks and a sandwich. No amenities whatsoever where given for free. Headphones, blankets, and real meals you had to buy. They provided movies but expect you to pay for headphones or bring your own.

### "Waited 7 hrs since 1pm"
Not Verified | Never again. The worst flight experience ever! Waited 7 hrs since 1pm and they still have absolutely no idea whether we will be able to fly tonight or not. Some says there is no pilot available!

### "don’t care if you are satisfied or not"
Not Verified |  I will never fly them again! I booked a flight from Las Vegas to Honolulu and I booked a flight with a different airlines to get from Honolulu to Australia. Right before departure they said that something is wrong with the engine and we have to wait to fix it. They took almost 2 hours and I didn’t see anyone fixing anything! Due to this, I missed my flight to Australia because of the time of landing! I basically lost around $2500 because I had book another ticket to Australia and also book a hotel room plus food for that night! I was trying to talk to the staff for more than 3 hours at the airport and they kept sending here and there without any solution! The service is so bad, they don’t care if you are satisfied or not.

### "no one cares to fix the maintenance issues"
Not Verified |  We had our flight from Sacramento to Honolulu delayed due to a technical issue as one of the engines didn’t start. It took them over an hour to figure it and in total 2hr delays. On the way back we had technical issues, engine stretch or something (different model). I am not sure how good their maintenance on this airplane are but it’s clearly a problem. We are not frequent flyers with Hawaiian Airlines but people who sits around us said it happens often. Just very sad how no one cares to fix the maintenance issues instead of going through this all the time! What’s the chances that both our flights in days difference had technical issues.

### "I will never fly Hawaiian again"
The Hawaiian website froze when I was attempting to book a ticket. I cancelled out of the site, waited to make sure I didn’t get an email saying the reservation went through, and several hours later went back to the site and booked the trip. The next day I got two emails with two different reservations. I called Hawaiian and the agent told me that they could cancel the ticket but not refund it. I asked if it could be used as credit toward a hotel stay and was told that it could. When I tried to redeem the credit the agent told me that it could only be used toward a flight. Hawaiian doesn’t even fly out of DFW so I lost $350. Had they been honest the first phone call I could have potentially used the credit some other way. I will never, ever fly Hawaiian Airlines again.

### "Don't expect any sort of service"
Not Verified |  My wife and I flew an inter-island flight from Maui to Honolulu in Nov 22. Although the flight was delayed the experience onboard was fine. Upon arrival into Honolulu one of our bags didn't make it. The man at the Honolulu Hawaiian airlines baggage desk was super rude and quite frankly it felt like he didn't even want to serve us. We filed a 'irregular baggage report' and did the standard protocol. The man at the desk said they would call first thing the following day and let us know our bag whereabouts. The next morning we received no call so decided to call the aiport as we where staying 1.5 hours from the airport. We were put on hold for 3.5 hours and then 2 hours where no one picked up the phone. The following day was the same! On hold for 3 hours and no answer. When someone finally answered they said they had found the bag and would send it out immediately. 2 days later we still hadn't received the bag and once again couldn't get through on the phone to anyone at the airport. We ended up driving to the airport where there were 3 staff working on the hawaiian airline baggage desk not serving anyone talking amongst themselves. When I asked why no one was answering their phone they all laughed. My bottom line! Don't expect any sort of service at all with Hawaiian airlines... especially if something goes wrong.

### "surprised at the poor customer service"
Not Verified | I'm not one to leave reviews but feel the need to warn people away from this airline. As someone who travels domestically and internationally very regularly I was surprised at the poor customer service and "gotcha" approach with flight changes. I made an error with booking inter-island transit and within 15 minutes tried to change it only to be told that customer service was unwilling to do so based on the "fare rules. mind you it was a first class ticket that had been changed once to this new island and by accident I got the wrong airport. This was disappointing and frustrating and, from my experience, not in line with industry standards for any other American or international carrier I have used (aside from deeply discounted budget brands). Do yourself a favor and avoid this airline. You don't want to be in my situation where an error caught in 15 minutes means you forfeit your $$$. So many other airlines fly to Hawaii and actually have some basic standards of customer service. The money grab really feels inconsistent with the beautiful culture of Hawaii. How disappointing.

### "Will never fly them again"
Not Verified |  Will never fly again. Booked a flight a year out and paid 345 each extra for extra comfort seats. 670 dollars. Went to check in the day before the flight and not only were my partner and I not even in the same area of the plane, we lost extra comfort. Called customer service and was told for over an hour our seats were gone and there was nothing they could do. Told us someone else had our seats. Then paid 270 per seat (540) to re upgrade and was told I would be reimbursed if I spoke with agents at Logan. They then told me I would have to call customer service. Kept going back and forth and both were useless, rude and zero help. Was told "don't worry" this won't happen 10 days later your seats are good to go. Checked in 10 days later and had same issue. They have literally stolen over a thousand dollars from me and just could not care less. Will never fly them again or recommend them to anyone. A terrible experience from start to finish.

### "I won’t fly with them anymore"
I’ve had so many problem with Hawaiian over the years that I had to write a review at this point. It started with them canceling my husbands and I’s flight during Covid and not offering any sort of voucher for a last minute hotel. If you can imagine, getting a hotel day of on Honolulu is the worst. Talk about cockroaches and a nasty bed. Not to mention being put on hold for 3 hours only to give up, call back later and be put on hold again for hours. That was in 2021. Later that year we purchased tickets and they were unable to check us in as though our tickets never even existed. que going to the “services” line in the Honolulu airport and coming close to missing our flight - not because we weren’t early but because the wait in the line was nearly out the door. And the employee barely knew what she was doing so everything took forever. If you’re unable to do the job properly you need more training. Now I go to check in in 2022 and they got rid of the check in lines all together and have kiosks and people walking around- you weigh your own bag etc. remember this is all at the Honolulu location. If you have an issue- just go wait in a line for hours and miss your flight. They got rid of free check in bags for military spouses (no other airline does this) the customer service said because they have “issues” with people sneaking bags or something - no, it’s clearly cutting corners. Active duty personnel is still allowed to have free checked bags but they have to go to the line that take 3 hours to simply have one checked bag. So they make you really contemplate if that free checked bag is worth missing your flight! Also all of this with no heads up with changed in policy’s. Unfortunately I already booked multiple flights with them the next month because they pop up the cheapest. But out of principal and their treatment of military and corner cutting I won’t fly with them anymore. Military and their spouses already have a hard enough time traveling around, paying for way more flights than normal people, so it’s clear how they feel about military. And before anyone says anything about military occupation, we all Know big corporations don’t care about that. They just want their $30 dollars, and to make sure they hire as little employees as possible. Also the seats are squished together so even as a small woman I’m shoulder to shoulder with people and can barely move. It was a nightmare trying to get comfortable

### "ruined the whole experience"
Before my flight I called Hawaiian airlines to get an approval to use my cpap machine on the plane each way from New York JFK to Honolulu. The woman told me I would have to upgrade my seat because coach does not have outlets but extra comfort does have them so I had to pay over $900 for upgrade for my wife and I to use my medical device. Only allowed 100 watts for a battery and that’s not enough to run a cpap machine. Flight from JFK to HNL no problem used the machine 5 star. Return flight from HNL to JFK I was told cpap machines are not allowed on the plane. I told the lady I was approved to use it. They called the supervisor and he said it is a safety issue I cannot use it. I said it is only a safety issue if it is used in the emergency exit, and this is not where I am sitting. Told him I was allowed to use it on flight 51 on the way to HNL. He said no I cannot use my machine on an overnight flight, my throat literally closes up from snoring. After reading Hawaiian Airlines rules it clearly says rule number 8 cpap is a medical device and allowed to be used. It's a shame this ruined the whole experience of flying with Hawaiian airlines because all the rest of the staff was great. Paid the for the seats so I can use the cpap.

### "It is so sad to be treated so inhumane"
Me and my wife had the worst experience on this airline. When arriving to Hawaii our baggage was lost and not one employee could care about our lost luggage. We contacted managers, employees and multiple people and not one person was compassionate, empathetic, cared or took the time of the day to follow up on this with us. I would not recommend flying this airline with our baggage still lost and us consistently being treated like just a number to them. It is so sad to be treated so inhumane.

### "Terrible customer service"
Not Verified |  Worst airline I have ever flown with. Chaotic, unorganised, unhelpful. Lost our bags twice. Said they would email or phone me when arrived. Still hadn’t heard anything after 4 days so turned up at airport and bags were sitting in a corner! Ruined my holiday. Terrible customer service. After traveling to 49 countries, this is the worst airline I have ever experienced. Would avoid whenever possible.

### "left the gate 15 minutes early"
Not Verified |  Worst experience of my life! Booked an 8:10am flight that left the gate 15 minutes early and left us behind due to TSA checks. We tried to board and they told us too bad it’s gone and out bags we’re already on the flight and gave us a number to call. We called reservations and went rounds for over an hour and a half! During that time they changed the flight prices on us 3 different times! After trying to get ahold of a manager and refusing to transfer we finally were forced to book the only flight they had. Cost us $2500 when it shouldn’t have been more than $100! Not only that but they took so long to get us situation we almost missed a 2nd flight! When we boarded the plane we were informed they don’t offer wifi which was a huge disappointment for a long flight! Emailed corporate to complain and they wrote me a sorry letter basically refusing to refund me and offer flight credits knowing I’ll never use them! Don’t waist your money on this airline they are the worst!

### "the worst experience"
Not Verified |  Absolutely the worst experience. I’ve had issues with Hawaiian Airlines for the past few months. Flights are delayed, bags and 30 minutes to be picked up. The only saving grace was the flight attendants. They seem to be much more empathetic with the situation.

### "customer service incredibly bad"
Where do I begin… arrived at airport before start of boarding. Booked first class tickets for the family in row 1 because a representative from their dial-in hotline said that’s where the bassinet would be. We decided to spend the additional money to ensure our 4 month old infant son (and us) would be comfortable. First, there was no first class boarding. Waiting in line with what seemed like every other boarding class. Second, arrived at our seats to discover there was no bassinet. The bassinet was the primary driver for the splurge on the 1st class seats… If I had seen the old ratty seats in the first class cabin in advance, I would have never opted to spend the extra money. Oh well… nothing the flight stewardess/stewards could do. They were incredibly polite. The plan takes off and everything sounds odd. After about an hour or two in air, we have to turn around due to mechanical failure. We were incredibly disappointed because it was virtually impossible to get our kids into the plane. We’ll it happens… Seemed like onboard crew was not given any information. Meals were served and unfortunately did not have much time to eat before crew had to clear everything for landing. We ended up landing back at LAX with emergency services crews everywhere. Quite literally a fleet of fire trucks. We disembark the plane and are instructed to stay by the gate. We stay there for quite a while. At some point, I notice the agents were no longer at the gate we exited the plan through but at a new gate with a new flight time and arrival time. I ask if this was our new flight and the response was less than enthusiastic. No explanation. No details. Seemed like they were looking to get back to their conversation and I was rudely interrupting. I go back to my seat and then the manager comes onto the PA system and informs everyone that the flight is delayed. I once again go to the boarding desk at the new gate and ask- “So, what are the options now?”. Answer now is “You’ll get a room, meal vouchers and then come back for a 1:45pm flight. I respond by telling them I would simply go home. I have 2 very young kids and it’s going to be incredibly difficult to I come back that early in the morning… what are my options? Answer was “well you can take the room and voucher or not… that’s up to you. If you want a refund, you would have to call. I forget the name of the department they mentioned. Once again very short and semi rude replies. Whatever, we’re now instructed to pickup our bags at bag. I call the hotline and more of the same. Essentially go on the early morning flight or travel 2 days later. No compensation for the lost time, lost money in other bookings, transportation, etc. not that I had asked but their general go to was “file a complaint”. In conclusion- planes are old and tatty. Food was by far the worse I’ve had on an airplane, and almost all levels of customer service were incredibly bad. I’ve never seen an airline with staff so uninterested in what they do. I do have to note their in-cabin crew was very nice. They seemed to have truly tried to help. Everyone else was god-awful. Remember… if this was my experience in first class, what would it be for folks in the other seats?

### "unable to sit with my husband"
I traveled using this airline for my honeymoon and I was unfortunately disappointed. Although the Hawaiian feel was fun and they provided much appreciated snacks/beverages, I was unable to sit with my husband on both flights to and from my destination even though we had purchased the tickets together. The seats are extraordinarily uncomfortable making the 5 1/2 hour flight painful. I will not be using Hawaiian air the next time I travel.

### "said this may have been a computer glitch"
I booked 2 flights with Hawaiian airlines (HA) directly through their website. I tried to check in and and baggage for my flights the day before when I received the email reconfirming my flight. It would not allow me. So I called. The customer service rep told me the amount I had paid for said flight was just to "place my flight on standby" and the 2 seats I purchased were not actually confirmed. He said this may have been a computer glitch because this never happens or sometimes with HA this happens because people want to pay their taxes for the flight at the airport. This has never happened before with any other airline I have used. I received no notice that my flight was not confirmed, instead I received the opposite that my flights were confirmed. If I had not called I may have gone to the airport to find out there were no more available seats on the flight (customer service rep told me this). This is crazy. I paid another $100 something for taxes. At first I thought it was a scam, but realized that didn't make sense because they had the correct flight info and my info before I have it to them. So thank God it wasn't a scam, but risked almost missing 2 flights on my honeymoon because of a "computer glitch" or failure to contact me to let me know my flight was not confirmed. None of this makes any sense. Customer service rep was very nice and worked with me. But extremely frustrating and still do not understand how this happened

### "Overpriced on luggage and unfriendly"
Not Verified |  Flight 167, terrible gate service. After 20 years of flying with this airline you just lost my business. It seems the gate people favor visitors over the local Kamaiana who are the main source of keeping your airlines open. Overpriced on luggage and unfriendly.

### "thank you Hawaiian for a job well done"
Boarding at JFK's Terminal 4 orderly and efficient. Seats comfortable for the nine hour flight back to Honolulu. The cabin crew was awesome with their food and snack service. The complimentary wine with the meals is a nice touch albeit the only course was a vegetarian pasta dish with salad and cookie. The snack prior to landing was good as well, especially with the mac-nut chocolate included. The flight itself was extremely smooth with very little turbulence along the way. Of the various airline pilots from different companies which I have flown, HA pilots make the smoothest landings, well appreciated. HA's entertainment could use more varieties of movies, and definitely a wi-fi system on board which HA has none. All in all thank you Hawaiian for a job well done. Hawaii truly does fly with Hawaiian.

### "Leaving all competition in the dust"
Leaving all competition in the dust. Despite being a single aisle aircraft, Hawaiian delivers on this route. Great seats and legroom are accompanied by warm efficient service. Warm greetings and consistent attention really make the difference. They served a very good substantial warm lunch with a separate dessert course. F/A’s were constantly making rounds offering top off’s etc. Only negative is no wi fi. Compared to the competition…well there is none. Tired of the tight spaces and dour faces on the other carriers.

### "attendants on Hawaiian just watch"
I fly interisland often in Hawaii and have flown with both Hawaiian and Southwest. SW has them beat by a long shot. SW flight crew actually assist with boarding on the plane, greeting you as you board, ensuring carry ons in the overhead compartments are placed neatly, this makes a big difference in shortening the boarding process. Flight attendants on Hawaiian just watch as passengers take their time wondering which compartments they should pick. This just prolongs the boarding process so if u have a tight connection it just makes it stressful. And you can't beat the price and service for flying SW. Sorry HAL, there's a new kid on the block.

### "literally offered zero service"
I will never choose Hawaiian airline anymore in my life. Both the ground and cabin staffs literally offered zero service! There were other couple things that happened and made me angry. But today I will particularly talk about a young male attendant who was on HA 21 from Seattle to Honolulu on August 20 morning. I asked him for a Coke while he was serving food and drinks, but then I politely asked him to exchange it for a zero. I used all sorts of polite words when I asked him, so I didn't feel I had offended him in any way. But he reacted to me with extreme impatience. He even stopped, looked at me and let out a loud sigh. I told him I was sorry when he changed it for me. But then the more I thought about it, the angrier I got, because it wasn't my fault at all, and he had no reason to be impatient with a small request from a customer. I can understand that he might have this irritable personality but I don't think that's the kind of personality that can work in the service industry. If he could read this post, he would know I was talking about him. I really want to hear an apology from him.

### "the seat was so bad!"
Employees were all friendly. They only came around twice for drinks in a 5 hour flight. Paid extra for leg room but the seat was so uncomfortable! Ticket was expensive and the ride was torturous, the seat was so bad!

### "flight attendants did nothing"
We called ahead of time and asked to make sure our 2 year old, who had his own ticket and seat, was seated next to his parents. When we got to the gate and asked the gate agent why our tickets were not together, they could not give us a good reason. The gate agents began barking orders to us as if we were the cause of the confusion. After we boarded, still without having at least one parent next to our 2 year old, the flight attendants continued to be rude and unhelpful. They said it was ridiculous that these seats were not together. We agreed but no one would fix it. It is absolutely stupid that we should have to request a second time to have one parent by a two year old who has a purchased ticket when we called ahead of time and were reassured our child had a parent by him. Fortunately, there were kind passengers that happily changed seats. The flight attendants did nothing except stand together in a stupor.

### "refused to cover any costs"
Not Verified |  My fiancé and I chose to fly Hawaiian Airlines for our first trip to Honolulu and had back-to-back issues with them. On our initial flight from Seattle to Honolulu, they lost our luggage. We were told by baggage claim services that we had to call the number we were given to talk to someone about what to do, but that our bags were most likely stuck in Seattle. After being on hold with the number they provided us for over an hour before even speaking to a single representative, we gave up with them. They eventually called us way later to inform us that our bags had been at the Honolulu Airport the whole time, but had been delivered to the wrong place. We finally got our bags back. On our flight back from Honolulu to Seattle, our flight with Hawaiian was so late that we missed our connecting flight. Hawaiian was so unhelpful and refused to cover any costs, accommodation, or anything. We couldn't afford a hotel and ended up having to sit at the Seattle airport for around 5 1/2 hours till family members were able to drive all the way to the Seattle airport to get us before we had to drive roughly three hours to our hometown. Such a ridiculously stressful experience, on top of which: my in-flight entertainment screen never worked on EITHER flight we had with them, there were zero vegetarian options for the free meal they provide for "dinner" (not everyone eats pork, Hawaiian! ), and the stewardesses seemed incredibly inconvenienced by the simplest of requests. Passengers shouldn't be treated this way when they pay a ridiculous amount to be on that flight.

### "Zero customer service"
Zero customer service regarding baggage claim report. It has been 11 weeks since my suitcase was damaged on the flight from Honolulu to Hilo. On the service phone you never get out of the waiting loop, e-mails are not answered. this is an impertinence. Where can I enforce my rights?

### "Stay away from this company"
Not Verified |  I just had a terrible experience with Hawaiian Airlines, after being their loyal customer for so long. My husband and I was offered multiple times a companion ticket discount of $100 but when I tried to use it online, it errored out, the website asked me to call their customer service and provided a phone number. I called in, explained that their website keeps error out upon using the discount. The rep told me that they "are aware of it", Reasonably enough, she offered to give me one time courtesy of not charging me $25 for using the phone service. Not until the price they offered me is ~$200 extra per person than the web pricing! Luckily, I did the math, and told her that, with the price they are offering me, I am probably better off buying the same tickets online without the $100 companion discount - What a trap! I insisted she to talk with her manager for at least matching the website pricing since I had to call in due to their website error. About an hour later, the rep did call me back, offering a much lower pricing than their first offer. I made the purchase. Only then, I noticed, adding taxes and everything, the actual discount I got is only $61 than my original website pricing, not the $100 discount as their "earned discount" offer of $100. Their explanation is: The base pricing for the ticket, since our phone conversation to get the $100 discount took so long (~3 hours), has gone up from $496.56 to $562! So, the actual cost for me to call in is more than the $25 phone change cost since their website didn't work. Yes, the website problem which should cost them in fact cost me instead! Yes, while they are claiming "No change fee" yet there is a $25 phone service charge upon anything you want to change, too! What a lying, cheating, blood-sucking company! They charge for every turn, every little thing including their mistakes, too (website error)! Stay away from this company, if you can! They are in blood-sucking mode right now!

### "poor quality offerings"
Phoenix to Honolulu. In order to enjoy a trip from Paradise home, one must pass through the gates of purgatory, which is another word for Hawaiian Airlines within the Daniel Inouye airport in Honolulu. For two seniors traveling with luggage, this was an excruciating experience. The three separate (and long) lines needing to endure just in order to check baggage was senseless. The walk from the main terminal to the gate to the departure area might as well have been from downtown Waikiki, which might have been more pleasant. And then there's the food onboard. Or more precisely, the absence of anything worthwhile to consume. Fortunately we learned our lesson on the outbound flight after going hungry for about eight hours. We packed a good lunch and snacks and were then able to bypass the airline's poor quality offerings.

### "providing well below average service"
Thank you very much for providing me with a horrible service and ruining my honeymoon. I used Hawaiian airlines for inter-island transfers and they were never on time, always late. I had a day trip to Maui and they started loading cargos after all passengers had completed boarding, thankfully it only took about 20 minutes or so. On 07/23/22, there was an issue on a plane and all passengers had to deplane and take another flight. i planned a day trip to Kauai departing Honolulu at 7am and coming back at 6 pm. however, because of the delay, now i have to cancel all booked activities. The airplane is still not departing (as of 7/23/22 8:40 am). One good thing about Hawaiian airlines is they are very consistent - they are very consistent in providing well below average service. They don't let you down when providing poor services. They are never sorry for anything. I have another upcoming island excursion to the big island. i hope not to get the same consistent service.

### "Such a bad customer service"
Kahului Airport. I was traveling with two kids and an infant. We got our bag tagged and only seen my infant’s paper ticket. Upon checking in my bag and my daughters car seat, the lady who assisted us kept yelling at me for a good 6 mins bc I didn’t see my ticket printed and it dropped on the ground. I was about to show her my e-ticket and she did not even bother and told me she didn’t need that and she demanded the paper ticket. She literally kept yelling at me trying to explain how she needed the “ticket” in order for “her” to scan. She told me to go back to the self service to check if I dropped my ticket in which she could have just easily printed it herself because she had already verified my ID. I went back and grabbed my ticket from the floor and gave it to her. She then told me she didn’t need it because she will print a new set of tickets. Such a bad customer service, rude and disrespectful AF. She shouldn’t be in a customer service industry with that rude attitude of hers.

### "no Vegan / Vegetarian food"
I recently traveled on flight HA030 from Hawaii to Seattle. We had to wait in a 2 hour long queue before boarding. My parents aged 75+ are diabetic. There was no Vegan / Vegetarian food option on the flight and the attendant didn't care about not having food for us on a 5 1/2+ hour journey. I will never fly Hawaiian Airlines again.

### "Terrible customer service"
Not Verified |  Hawaiian Airlines is great for flying, but terrible customer service. My wife has been on the phone with them about once every 2 months for the past year trying to get her name changed on her Hawaiian Airlines account. The customer service tells her to do the same thing every time and that she will be contacted within 24 hours. She never gets a return email, call, nothing. She just got off of the phone with them and the representative told her to literally just hope that it gets done this time. She asked to speak with someone else and was denied. This is literally never going to get resolved. Terrible customer service.

### "What deceptive business practices"
So utterly disappointed. I booked my ticket under the airlines website's promise of "no change fee". After calling to change my travel dates due to work, turns out there is a change fee. Furthermore, the fare differential to make the travel date change is higher than if I were to rebook a new ticket. That's just great AI driven pricing software. What deceptive business practices. Hawaiian Airlines has one of the very best cabin service in my opinion. Yet, their ticketing and customer service, which is farmed out to a 3rd world call center staffed by 5th world personnel, seems substandard compared to other airlines. Emptor Caveat. Buyer Beware. Behind that warm aloha spirit, they are still a money making machine first and foremost, customer service be damned.

### "Will never use them again"
Had the most unpleasant experience with checking in. There were three lines: one for first class, one said “main cabin” and the third one for dropping the bags. We waited in the main cabin line for 30 minutes because the airline representatives were extremely slow. And when it was our turn to check in, we were asked to wait because there were people in the first class line. Apparently, first class passengers get a priority in the main cabin line as well. We tried to ask but Hawaiian representatives very surprisingly rude. I’ve never had such experience with airlines in USA. Will never use them again.

### "the most reasonable carrier in USA"
First time to fly with Hawaiian and by far the most reasonable carrier in USA I flew from SFO-HNL on first class. The crew were nice and smiling and they offered welcome drinks an IPad for flight entertainment and a breakfast which was ok. Nothing special about it but adequate service over all. However the aircraft was old and the first class seat when fully recline is not comfortable at all for a sleep. Luckily it was a morning flight and didn’t need to sleep. The highlight was the friendly smiling crew of Hawaiian something is missing in all other US carriers. And being a full service airline domestically even though they fly from international terminals.

### "really good, clean and comfortable"
Not Verified |  My overall experience with this airline is really good, clean and comfortable. Best part is entertainment options are good especially with kids staff and all crew members are good too. One request to all airlines when someone traveling with kids give them seats that are comfortable for them with kids because some people are really rude during flights they don’t want any noise. They don’t understand that kids can’t keep quiet for 5, 6 hours sometimes it’s really hard for those who are traveling with kids.

### "Hawaiian is the absolute worst!"
Not Verified |  Have flown every airline and Hawaiian is the absolute worst! Paid for premium economy and was no different than economy. Same seats, same food and we were told we could not stretch our legs because the area in front of our seats was considered a walk way. Booked 6 months in advance and chose flight based on available seats. When we were boarding instead of the front row we reserved they changed our seats to the back. Unacceptable!

### "very friendly and efficient crew"
Ok. Nothing spectacular Inter island quick and painless. Honolulu to Los Angeles comfortable, very friendly and efficient crew. No WiFi Mediocre entertainment on a clumsy IPad. Food was well presented but awful tasting. Flight was on time Long (20 minute) walk from gate to baggage claim. Although bag was tagged priority it was almost last to come out. As I said, a mixed bag.

### "Recommend for short inter island flights"
Flow inter island from Honolulu to Hilo and back for a quick weekend trip. We came from the mainland and visited Oahu so we thought of visiting Hilo island. Flight from Honolulu to Hilo was good - at check-in, the name on the boarding pass didn't match as ID and TSA requested me to go visit Guest Services; they rectified the issue quickly. Boarding was quick and efficient. For a 35 minute flight passionfruit juice was served which was adequate. Flight took off on time, crew was very efficient in the service. Likewise for Hilo to Honolulu sector. Recommend Hawaiian for short inter island flights! !

### "Little about this flight was impressive"
We recently celebrated our 40th wedding anniversary and we wanted to fly to HNL, where we spent our Honeymoon. We purchased First Class R/T tickets on Hawaiian Airlines. Not much about the experience was impressive, and I wish we'd given that $7,000 to the Ukrainian war effort. The agent gave us the gate number but said nothing about the need to line up at the gate and be checked in for a wrist band to avoid having to get screened once we arrived in HNL. About 20 minutes prior to departure we realized that people were queuing up and receiving wrist bands, so we got in line. After having been in line for about 15 minutes, the same agent who had taken our bag at the ticket counter advised those of us still in line that it was too late to be issued a wrist band and walked away. Not only had all of the extensive online pre-clearance effort been a waste of time but we only ended up boarding the flight a few minutes before the doors were closed prior to departure. I was livid before we left the gate and worked hard to not let such a poor showing on their part ruin our vacation before we left the ground. Little about this flight was impressive. The lie-flat seats belong not in first class but in an intermediate class of service. They are 6 abreast in the cabin. The lack of wi-fi at this juncture is inexcusable. iPads for entertainment? Really? Were we eligible to use the first-class lounge? What about the frequent flyer miles? Where would we find them, and can we have Delta FFMs instead? And then there was the food. Two chicken thighs with the skin on in a forgettable sauce was in-edible for me, I never eat dark-meat poultry. That was the extent of the food until breakfast, which wasn't much better. There were no snacks served in between on a flight exceeding 10 hours. Had my wife not brought her extensive survival rations that she typically takes when she flies to Asia, we would have been starving by the time we got to HNL. The return flight was equally pathetic--essentially Chef Boy-R-Dee ravioli without the sauce. It was tasteless and so dry we couldn't eat it all, and it was not a generous serving. Breakfast: also pathetic, we stopped and ate at First Watch on the way home. Like the food, the service was forgettable. Actually, it was nearly non-existent. If you don't ring a call button you won't see a Flight Attendant between meal services. Beverage choice in First Class is quite limited. Hawaiian offers a level of service that resembles Southwest Airlines. Do not under any circumstances purchase a first class ticket. Neither their Agents nor Flight Attendants are trained to provide that level of service. Their cabin interiors are dated and not adequately maintained. There is no WiFi. In Flight entertainment is via iPad, which must be purchased in coach. There is little customer service available from the company - virtually nothing in real time. I've been waiting for a response from them via their website for over a month, which is why I elected to post this online. We liked the fact that we could fly non-stop between Orlando and Honolulu; for less money we could have flown on Delta and, given the lengthy maintenance delay on our return flight we would have spent no more time had we connected in any of their hubs. Bottom line: Don't expect Delta Service on Hawaiian Airlines.

### "comfort of lie-flat seats great"
Hawaiian’s location at Bradley Terminal at LAX is not good! Super long walk (20 min?) to gates. There are small carts available for part of the walk. Upon return, to get to baggage claim takes even longer and is very difficult with multiple escalators. First class on LAX-LIH was so bad (more like a coach seat) that we re-routed through HNL on return for lie-flat seats. Food was terrible, but service and comfort of lie-flat seats great!

### "the food was very poor"
Not Verified |  Staff are lovely but the food was very poor, you don’t even get a bread roll. I am a small person so I was ok but for a man not sure how they would go. However they were very generous when it came to wine.

### "flight's service was appalling"
Not Verified |  I flew to Hawaii from Las Vegas on Hawaiian Airlines. Only the ticketing and customer service are excellent. The flight's service was appalling. There was no options for vegetarian and vegan. I just napped on the plane from Honolulu to Las Vegas while they served dinner. They didn't bother to call me. When I inquired about food after 5 minutes, they abruptly informed me that no food will be served at this time. The strangest thing is that if I purchase with a credit card, they would deliver the food. This is inexcusable. During the journey, I only received a small amount of juice. The flight attendant was quite haughty and unprofessional. In general, they treat passengers as though they are travelling free of cost. In the future, I would not fly with Hawaiian Airlines.

### "they provided no service"
Not Verified |  Firstly, during the booking of the flight the reservationist confirmed that the tickets were for comfort plus seating. Upon arrival to gate, was advised that seats were standard cabin and would need to upgraded to comfort plus but unfortunately nothing was now available. We asked about upgrading to first class and was told we'd have to enter a bid. Sounded odd but this was the first time using this airline so not understanding. During the flight my seat was broken, reclined during take off and throughout the flight making it a very unsafe, uncomfortable and a frustrating flight. In additional to not having the seats we preferred, a seat that was broken, the stewardess had a open bottle of water with no cap and spilled water on my fiancée as she was attempting to give her trash wetting her entire left side blouse. She apologized but this only added to frustration. Upon arriving to the destination, we immediately went to check-in to advise of the trip and inquire about either upgrading to Comfort Plus, First Class or cancelling return flight. Was advised we'd need to contact reservations. This is the first time using Hawaiian Airlines, the first leg of our trip and would never use again especially considering the fact that when we called, they provided no service and didn't bother to do anything to fix the problem or accommodate our return flight.

### "Customer service is the worst"
Not Verified |  Customer service is the worst I have ever experienced relative to other airlines. Their "live chat" is worthless and its near impossible to rebook a ticket. You can't do it yourself if it involves more than one city which is absurd. Changing a ticket booking because the airline canceled flight is a basic level of service that I should be able to do from my phone. If you are going to force me to have a representative to rebook my ticket then provide representatives that are available! I spent days waiting on phone lines and "Live Chat" rooms for such a simple task. If the tickets weren't so overpriced, I would of dumped the money and rebooked with another airline. I have no issues with the actual planes, flight attendants or workers of Hawaiian airlines but the company needs serious restructuring of its customer facing services.

### "it was literally like pulling teeth to get a refund"
Not Verified |  I very rarely leave reviews as I feel it is easier to say things that have gone astray than to talk about the good things. However, when I booked a flight then cancelled it - it was literally like pulling teeth to get a refund. The agents for Hawaiian Airlines seem ill prepared and undertrained to handle any situation. Needless to say, this experience has made me tell everyone I know about what to expect when booking with this airline.

### "our flights had been canceled"
They wouldn't let us fly to Hawaii because our COVID test was 80 hours ago so we missed our flight. Bought 2 one way tickets on Alaska airlines which was great. Then when leaving on Hawaiian our flights had been canceled. After an hour fixing that we were seated next to a screaming kid. We asked for ear plugs and the FA said sure but never brought them. So for 5 hours we would doze off and be awoken by a screaming kid. My first trip to Hawaii ended as the worse day of my life.

### "destroyed its customer service credibility"
While staff are generally friendly on board Hawaiian Airlines flights, customer service for anything not in person is unforgivingly terrible. You will spend hours to get the most basic support like rescheduling a ticket. There call center lines occasionally out source to some foreign countries with people who barely speak English and it’s very disappointing. Hawaiian for then last decade used to be my preferred airlines, but with the death of island air and corporate greed caused by COVID you're better off flying Delta or Southwest. Very disappointed with how this company has destroyed its customer service credibility over a few thousand dollars? Corporate greed at it’s finest.

### "Terrible experience"
Not Verified | Honolulu to Kahului. Terrible experience trying to get refund for canceling travel for medical reason. We thought the mask mandate would be over when we booked our flight. Due to high blood pressure and retina vein occlusion and some loss of eyesight my husband cannot wear a mask for 14 hours. We thought the mandate would be over by now so called to cancel. The will not give a refund or rescheduled. Reschedule has to be in 3 months which we cannot get back by then and hope for mandates to end by then either. We were charged almost $400 to go one way for two of us between HNL and Maui. Refund for situations that you cannot control are non-existent and prices rather high. No consideration for doctor report of risk for flying extended time with mask.

### "I love Hawaiian airlines"
Honolulu to Los Angeles. The trip from LAX to Honolulu was superb. The food was amazing, the service was wonderful, and the lay-flat seats were glorious. I am grateful for their mask and vaccine mandate as it made me feel safer since this is my first time traveling again since Feb of 2020. The trip back from Honolulu to LAX was good, but this time the food was disgusting. They are supposed to have some serious chefs that do their food and I would have given them kudos for the first trip. But the food coming back tasted about as good as it looked. It was supposed to be coq au vin (wine-braised chicken) with green onion chickpea cake. Well, the chicken was the stuff you leave after stripping away the meat from the chicken - the left-over giblets with gristle, fat, and skin. Yuk. The green onion cake had absolutely no flavor at all. You might as well have eaten a piece of the polyester pillow. And those little bitter mushroom things that looked like worms? What are they thinking? Seriously. A true chef understands that there must not only be flavor, there must be a visual appeal. This meal ruined the entire trip and tasted about as good as it looked. I nearly got sick to my stomach. My mother (who usually eats anything) also thought it was repulsive. YUK!! Overall I love Hawaiian airlines and I would fly with them again but they need to get a grip on the food. To Hawaiian Airlines: When you try too hard to give people the "fru fru" stuff you miss the ball altogether. Give us some meat with veggies and a vegan option and call it good. No need for the weird stuff. And you'll save some money by avoiding expensive disgusting ingredients too. Stick to the basics. A happy tummy is a happy customer.

### "Worst customer experience calling them"
Not really specific for the flight information provided above, but when I tried to travel the next time (tried to book / cancel). On my previous trip, the flight was delayed by 12+ hours. Due to this, we received travel credits of $300 each for the next flights. Now trying to use this credit to book the trip, and wasted hours and hours due to it. Booked a flight that is 2-3 months away from now to KOA (Kona airport), so I thought the ticket price would be pretty stable. We booked the flight through the Hawaiian website, used up all the credit to save up so we ended up paying $118 each (it was $418 - $300 credit). The next day, we saw the price dropped to $358 per ticket, so we contacted customer service (the call was on hold 30+ min) to either get our price matched or cancel the flight. The customer service representative said I can get $418 full refunded to my credit card, which really didn't make sense so I confirmed it multiple multiple times and the associate confirmed that that is going to be the case. After a week, I only see $118 posted on my card. Contacted them again waiting 30+min again, they said they did refund $418 to the card and asked me to contact my credit card bank to confirm the refund amount. Did that and American Express confirmed that they only see $118 from Hawaiian. Called Hawaiian again, holding 30+ min again, and finally, they transferred to the supervisor (which took another 30+ min). Finally, the supervisor says they cannot do a full refund since $300 was charged by travel credit, and they can re-send the travel credit via email. I complained about my wasted time and also told him to please educate the customer service associate about this non-refundable travel credit information so people like me don't have to waste their precious time, and the supervisor just hung up on me without any answer! I don't know when or whether I'll be receiving my credit, and I really don't want to call them again for the credit not received yet, but I may have to. Worst customer experience calling them, never had a clean flight with them, plus they are usually more expensive than other airlines, so I'd highly highly recommend flying with some other airline.

### "attendants were all very nice and cheerful"
Used Hawaiian Airlines for a day trip on Tuesday 02/15/22 from HNL to OGG to visit hubby's family there. Hawaiian Airlines use all of Terminal 1 in HNL airport. Announcements were made frequently regarding flight status and gate updates, really good. Boarding is quite organized and people were called to board by zones. The airplane for flight HA 216 was N488HA, a 23 years old B712. We opted for the over wing emergency exit with extra legroom. The seats are very standard plastic backed type and at the emergency exit the tray tables were located in the armrest. However since the trip only takes minutes we don't really have the need for the tray table. We only bring our backpacks for the flight and were able to put them under the seat in front of us. The overhead bins are on the small side, and based on its size can accommodate slimmer carryon only. We depart around 15 minutes later than schedule (which is a big deal for the 20-30 minutes inter island flights like these) however we land around 5 minutes ahead of schedule. The flight attendants were all very nice and cheerful, and within a short 20-25 minutes flight were able to serve us drink (water or a delicious POG juice cocktail - Passion fruit-Orange-Guava) and collect all the trash within minutes, and we are ready for landing.

### "enjoyed our flight with them"
We flew Hawaiian Airlines back to HNL after a day trip to Kahului to visit hubby's cousin there. The flight HA 395 OGG-HNL was using N484HA, a 23 years old B712. The incoming airplane arrived early but there was still another airplane at its designated gate; and after waiting for a few minutes they were able to use a different gate so there will be no delay. A relief, since we have to catch a flight out from HNL later that night. Boarding was quite orderly and we were boarded by zones. The flight left on time and arrived in HNL around 10 minutes early. The FAs in this flight were very nice and cheerful, and they have good interactions with the passengers. Within 20-25 minutes flight the FAs were able to serve water or juice for passengers, collect all the trash and getting ready to land again. Hawaiian Airlines is a good airline to use for short island hop trips like this, and we enjoyed our flight with them.

### "Never will I fly Hawaiian Airlines"
Never will I ever fly Hawaiian airlines even if they let me fly for free! Our family was stop at the boarding gate because we had shopping bags and purse, saying they only allow 1 carry on 1 personal items. So if you went shopping they count that as a personal item so you can’t bring it on the plane. Doesn’t everyone go shopping for souvenirs? How is one suppose to bring it back? How about food n snacks if you carry the snack in your hands it’s also consider as a personal item. Even my small Fanny pack was consider a personal item so I ask what do they want me to do they rudely reply as “that’s for you to figure out!” While rolling their eyes. Never will I fly Hawaiian Airlines.

### "Very friendly efficient staff"
Still 2-2-2 seating and no wi fi but other than that a great flight. Very friendly, efficient staff served a nice meal and snacks later on along with drinks and regular cabin pass through checks. IFE is clumsy and limited but fine for five hours. Seat is comfortable and does recline. They need a more world class front cabin but the aloha goes a long way

### "never book with Hawaiian again"
Booking with Hawaiian is a nightmare. Tried booking on the website using our Hawaiian miles but couldn’t because of a website error. Had to call and book the reservation instead. Took 3 hours just to get through to someone. Finally was able to book the reservation only to see that my card was charge 3 times. Called again, waited 4 hours, tossed around from operator to operator each one telling me they were unable to refund. After 12 hours finally got to someone who told me they could request a refund for me. Fine. Two days later I see they charge me 2 more times! And the nightmare continues. Once again calling and being told they cannot refund me. I will never book with Hawaiian again.

### "HAL got us where we needed - eventually"
We had booked a multi-leg trip through Delta that used "Partner" Hawaiian Airlines (HAL) between islands. For their part, HAL got us where we needed - eventually...but not without a lot of wasted vacation time and unnecessary anxiety. 1) An hour before check-in for the next day's flight to Kona we get a text from HAL that our flight was cancelled. Okay, cutting slack for COVID or whatever reason (none was given) we were still worried about how to continue the next leg of our trip. We had no place to stay if we couldn't travel, and expensive reservations waiting the next day. They gave us a Toll-Free number to "call", after hours of trying, all we got was busy signal and we never got through. There was no way to rebook on HAL website, since ticketing was through Delta. So, spending 4 hours on hold getting through to Delta we rebooked for a later HAL flight - but had to pay fare difference, even though it wasn't our fault we had to make a flight change. 2) Arriving at the airport, HAL was a mess. Although our reservation included checked bags, they insisted we had to pay because, "we're not Delta Airlines. I get that, but we paid Delta - who already paid HAL for our seats and baggage. 3) Finally getting on the plane, there were a ton of open seats. My guess is the earlier cancellation wasn't COVID related, just saving expense to consolidate flights. We were in Economy seats and after boarding, all Exit Rows were open. On any other airline, we've been allowed to move to open seats, but not on HAL. At first, the flight attendant said we couldn't sit there because of Exit Row requirements. I responded, "as long as we meet Exit Row requirements, why can't we sit there? His response, "more money. I get it, they market them as Premium seating. After cancelled flights, additional charges and vacation time lost, the least HAL could have done was let us sit there. The Customer Service value would cost them nothing. No. Who sat there instead? Uniformed HAL employees, probably being repositioned. I'm not begrudging that staff deserves to be treated well, but aren't we the paying customers? Through everything it seemed the message HAL was sending was, we don't need you - you need us - so live with it. Easy fix - Obviously, HAL had our cell numbers, because they texted us that the flight was cancelled, due to low occupancy. It would have been easier for them to simply put us on another flight and tell us of the time change. Better yet, since there were only about 30 people booked, they could have called us. Rather than have us keep calling their toll-free and never getting through, one of their agents could have called us (same amount of time on the phone for their agents). We paid a premium for everything on this trip, costs were about 30% higher than in the past. We knew that going in. The cost of more than a half-day of lost vacation time and toll of having your itinerary cancelled mid-trip - priceless.

### "Impossible to reach customer service"
Impossible to reach customer service. They canceled my flight but I can't reach anyone to receive a refund. When I did finally get someone on the phone, the call was disconnected before a refund was processed. They didn't call me back and the wait to speak to a representative no matter when I call is almost two hours long. I've tried both chat and text customer service options. They responded over 36 hours later when I was asleep and closed the thread before I responded a couple hours later. This has happened three times! Not even given a chance to respond and I still do not have a flight or a refund!

### "shouldn’t have to take two hours to recheck bags"
Not Verified | Worst airline. I had a 4 hour layover and needed to recheck my bags since i was transferring airlines. I spent an hour getting to Hawaiian Airlines check in since is in a different terminal? I guess Hawaiian Airlines with international flights instead of the domestic where i landed. I got there with my 5 bags from my extended trip and the check in was closed! Apparently they close 30min after each flight and open 2.5 hours before each flight. So I'm stuck here till 11:30pm for them to reopen. It shouldn’t have to take two hours to recheck bags. It’s ridiculous.

### "The kiosks to check in were closed"
I fly regularly both international & domestic. I booked a quick inter island flight from Kauai (to Oahu where I live). For internet island travel the boarding pass says to check in 30 minutes before. My flight was at 7:45 so I was dropped off in front of the Hawaiian Airlines check-in at the Lihue airport at 7:15. I wasn’t checking a bag so literally just needed to complete the 30 second check in on the kiosk. The kiosks to check in were closed. When I went up to the counter the lights were off & the two agents were walking around the counter. They said “the counter closes at 7:15, no one was here. You can’t check in now.” I said “it’s literally 7:16 right now, I was here trying fo check in but your kiosks are closed.” The agent speaking to me was very rude saying “well we closed at 7:15, you were supposed to check in 30 minutes before your flight.” (which is what I was doing). When I asked what I could do she shrugged saying “we are closed, come back tomorrow.” I have never seen an airline close all it’s windows before the last flights leave and they should definitely put this on your boarding information and say 45 minutes or 60 minutes since they don’t disclose that they close beforehand. I had to pay for a ticket the next day & I think it’s completely unacceptable that this airline closed before their last flights take off and they were definitely closed before the 30 minute window and were not helpful to reschedule me. I will be using Mokulele from now on for any of my flights since there’s no aloha from this company.

### "Hawaiian airlines are the worst"
Not Verified |  I had to change my kids tickets due to the new covid variant and the airlines charged $400 first time when the kids wanted to stay longer to participate in the community project and then yesterday they charged $700 to change the ticket as I did not feel comfortable leaving my kids at the island due to the new covid variant. Other airlines are so flexible at this time but Hawaiian airlines are the worst.

### "worst experience on this airline"
I had the worst experience on this airline. I am 18 years old and have flown quite a bit, both internationally and within the US. I am a female and I was on my period. I had run out of some stuff and needed to get to my sister who had some feminine products in her bag. She was on the other side of the plane all the way to the back. I quickly made my way back there trying to not get into anyone’s way. When I got there the flight attendants were getting ready to do the food runs so I moved out of their way. When I was ready to go back they were in the way so I sat in an empty seat to talk to my sister. I was then told I had to go back to my seat. I informed the flight attendant that I would as soon as they weren’t in the way of the isle. She argued for a bit then finally left it alone. As soon as the isle was clear I went back to my seat but was stopped by a flight attendant physically blocking my path and stopping me with her hand. I told her I wasn’t going to walk through there again and just was getting something from my sister. She then accused me of going back and forth over 3 times. I corrected her and she continued to complain about what i was doing even though I was not causing any problems. After the flight my sister told me she had also had issues with a different flight attendant. That makes 3 different attendants who were rude. When we got my sisters bag out of baggage claim it was soaked and the metal badge had been ripped off. They honestly were so rude and unkind it was shocking. I have never written a bad review because I try to assume people are doing their best, but this was just awful. I will never fly with them again.

### "totally unprofessional and arrogant"
Worst service I have experienced! The check in agent notified me that there was a $30 fee per bag, no big deal, I said “you’ve got to be kidding me!”. Apparently, he thought I said something else and immediately got in my face, yelling, screaming, threatening etc.. Then proceeded to tell me my credit card, which I used 10 minutes prior, was bad, obviously trying to jerk me around and embarrass me in front of everyone else in line. I am a business manager, if one of my employees treated a customer in such a disrespectful manner, they would be fired on the spot! I will never use Hawaiian again nor recommend them to anyone! I do hope that management from Hawaiian Airlines makes necessary changes so that others do not have such a horrible experience. They are totally unprofessional and arrogant with the way they treat their paying customers!

### "worst customer service ever"
My family and I were going to Honolulu in November. I purchased 5 tickets costing $1870 in August and tried to get a refund in September, 40 days before our flights were scheduled for. Hawaiian Airlines said they canceled the flights but the money would be credited to my account and needs to be used with the next year or forfeit your money. If that isn't the textbook definition of extortion then I don't know what is. All their tickets are non-refundable. You need to purchase a 3rd party insurance to protect your travel which I have. But why should I use the insurance when I didn't use the Airlines services. My hotel and rental car refunds were returned in one day. The customer agent lied to me and said when you purchase the tickets it says refundable or nonrefundable which it doesn't add she called me a liar. The worst customer service ever. I've written numerous complaints to Hawaiian Airlines all with returns saying they will not refund my money.

### "Very disappointed with the treatment we received"
I’ve flown Hawaiian Airlines for the first time twice now in the last two months. Flew first class both times and I will say the flight attendants and service were wonderful both times. The check-ins not so good! Both airports we ran into extremely rude check-in clerks. At Ontario’s check-in we had a male clerk that was extremely rude. He wouldn’t even look at our paperwork showing we’d been vaccinated and tested negative for COVID-19. Wasn’t about to help us and told us we’d have to get out of line to download our results even though one of our results had been downloaded. Isn’t his job to help? On the way back at Honolulu airport the clerk looked at us like she had doubts we were in first class even after showing her our boarding passes. Had the nerve to asked us twice and looked down her nose at us. I’m not sure what the problem is with their customer service, but they definitely need to work on it. I’ve worked with the public for over 45 years and know this is not how you treat your customers. Very disappointed with the treatment we received from them at their check-in counters.

### "Do not book on this airline"
Not Verified |  We had to cancel our trip to our timeshare due to Covid restrictions (pretty much wear a mask everywhere and stay in your room). Governments new mandate 8/21. Hawaiian said due to Covid cancellations they will hold your ticket for your next trip. What they don’t tell you, is that they only waive the change fee, and you have to rebook within one year of your original booking date. In my case that was March 1, 2021. (With our timeshare we are only allowed to book 1 year in advance) Also, they will collect any additional fees if there is a change in your ticket cost. No accommodating for Covid/Government hotel/timeshares etc shut downs for restrictions. Do not book on this airline. I’m now out $500.

### "how bad this experience was"
We arrived at the airport in Maui 4 hours before our flight was scheduled to depart to Oakland. It looked like they decided to have every flight for the day leaving all within a 2 hour window due to the extreme amount of people trying to check in. It took over 1 hour just to have 1 bag scanned through to check for fruit / agricultural items. Then we sat in line for 2 hours just to check in one bag. This line moved at a snails pace and only had 2 employees checking baggage in. I have never seen such a slow process in my life. It literally took around 10 minutes per person. There was no sense of urgency from any of the staff at any time. The lines grew so large that they stacked up down the street. I have 3 small children who had to stand in the heat the whole time.. Then we had to stand in another line to go through security. There must have been 500 people wrapped around the building. I had to beg another family to let us cut in line because our flight was about to leave and would have had to stand in line for at least another 3 hours. We somehow made it 5 minutes before boarding. The worst part of the day was the male flight attendant (Dark spiked hair, glasses, approximately 35-40). He must have been having a bad day because his customer service was terrible. He was rude, grumpy, pushy, conttoling, and had a poor attitude. He constantly baggered people about wearing their masks even though this was during the time they kept serving food and drinks. What are we supposed to do? Cut a hole in the mask for a straw? Overall just not the kind of person I would expect to be a flight attendant. I could tell that the other female staff members did not like working with him. Doesn't seem like someone that should be working in customer service. The flight from Oakland to Maui was wonderful. I work in customer service and depend financially on receiving good surveys. This is actually the first time I have written a negative review on anything online in my entire life, I never complain unless in person. So that should tell you how bad this experience was.

### "procedure to again deplane us"
Our 2 year old baby was required to wear a mark during the boarding of our flight from Honolulu to Boston. We, the parents, fully cooperated with the personal by putting on his mask, but he refused to use the mask because he was hungry and drinking his bottle in this moment. We made clear to the staff that he will be wearing his mark as soon as his finish his bottle but even though we were asked to deplane and stay in Honolulu at our own expenses. Our flight was rebooked to the next day. During the check-in and boarding time, we were given a special treatment by not only being allowed to do online check-in but also by being closely checked by the staff if our son was wearing the mask. As the feeding time of our son mashed with the boarding time, we faced a same situation as the day before. Our son woke up asking for his baby bottle. We gave the bottle already sat in the airplane. It resulted in a clear procedure to again deplane us (as we were threated).

### "We ended up having to buy three new tickets on United Airlines"
Never again! We arrived at the airport at 12pm for our 2pm flight out of OGG. Check-in had already been done the day before on the HA app and we also paid $30 for a checked bag. The situation at the airport was complete chaos. Huge lines apparently just for bag drop off. Self check-in kiosks were not working properly and not printing out bag tags. We ended up having to wait on one of those lines. But before that (and several times more during our wait) we talked with someone from the HA staff and explained our situation: I have a heart condition and need to be medicated every day. Losing our flight (even though we arrived at the airport 2 hours in advance) could have drastic consequences. The staff person guaranteed us that we would board the plane and that the flight would wait for us if needed. Again, we were guaranteed multiple times that the flight would not depart without us. At 1.50pm we finally reached one of the bag drop off desks… but the HA assistant suddenly left the desk and said she couldn’t help us. No one apparently was available to help us so we waited a few minutes until finally we went to another line and asked to be helped - it was 1.55pm. When we were about to check our bag (which had been already paid for) the new HA assistant told us that the boarding for our flight was already closed and we couldn’t board. I explained my health condition and what we had been told before by other HA staff - that the plane would wait for late passengers due to the chaotic situation at the airport. Unfortunately, the HA people were still not able to let us board our flight and, even worse, were not interested at all in offering any kind of alternative to help us go to San Jose (or San Francisco) on the same day. Finally a "manager" came to help us but, of course, she was also completely useless. Her excuse was that all passengers are advised to arrive 3 hours before their flight, for a domestic flight! She said everyone received an email with this notification. Obviously, we didn't get anything remotely similar to it. At the end, she apparently was got tired of dealing with an upset customer and decided to ask for security to get us removed. Right. We ended up having to buy three new tickets on United Airlines for that night - in other words, we paid an $1k+ more, waited in OGG for 7 hours and arrived home one day after. I lost one cycle of my medication - hopefully there won’t be other serious consequences. The lack of concern, ridiculous handling of bag drops at the airport and total misinformation by the HA staff are all reasons for our disappointment. Because of HA, we had to buy three new tickets on a different airline.

### "worst airline I've ever flown on"
Avoid at all costs! After boarding we were informed that there was a problem with engine. Spent 2 hours inside the plane and were deboarded. Right after that it was announcement about 14,5 hours delay! Finally around midnight we took off. The flight attendants and gate agents were very rude. It was very cold inside the plane. I was lucky to get a blanket, but my husband was not. When he asked for the blanket, the flight attendant offered him to purchase, no free blanket any more! It was 11 hours of torture, literally. The food was not edible. I am not a picky eater, but what they served was not a food, it was a garbage. The worst airline I've ever flown on. Never again.

### "Super disappointing"
I had booked about 2 months in advance, then three weeks before my flight I was double checking travel times and noticed that my connecting flight in LA had changed and was no longer possible to connect. I called in and was told that a change had been made to my flight, that there was no alternative flight I could be booked on and my only option was a refund. I wondered "where was the call when you changed the flight? If I hadn't called in I could have shown up in LA with no flight to Hawaii. And there was no “we're sorry for the inconvenience please enjoy______” (fill in the blank - maybe some free air miles or something? I've been a Hawaiian air miles member for over 10 years). The impression the customer service rep gave me was that she was just waiting for me to accept the refund so she could say her rehearsed "I do really apologize is there anything else I can assist you with? line. The refund takes 7-10 business days so I couldn't even use my money to book a replacement ticket with another airline. Super disappointing.

### "should have never booked with them"
Not Verified |  I have to change my flight dates because of a situation at work. No compassion or understanding or willing to work with their customers. Which I think they should appreciate given that the pandemic happened and airlines are hurting. I said I was willing to pay the difference to change the dates and all they want to do is say no and not work with someone in a tough situation. Even tried to upgrade. This is whole thing ridiculous and I should have never booked with them. They are forcing someone to spend more money to because they are greedy for not being able to make money last year. This is a scam and an insult.

### "never fly with them for future trips"
We were halfway to Vegas when the captain announced that we were flying back to Honolulu due to a medical emergency. First, already annoyed that they couldn't just divert to LAX, which was an hour away, opposed to HNL, 2.5 hours flying back. When we arrive back in HNL, we're told to deboard so the passenger can be cared for and the plane can be refueled/cleaned. We were given an estimate of an hour. Well it is now 2 hours and we should have already re-departed. Now there has been an "incident on the jet bridge" and we are still waiting to board. So in my opinion a re-route back to our original destination, a 7 hour delay, rude and grumpy flight attendants and gate agents, and no compensation or meal vouchers offered, are all valid reasons qualifying for a 1-Star review and I will never fly with them for future trips.

### "wouldn’t recommend them to anyone"
I recommend anyone even thinking about flying on Hawaiian airlines please don’t make my mistake. I’ve seen them harass military members and just because I was military they literally told me that I’m not welcome and cancelled my flight. I did get a creditable refund but even trying to get that utilized is ridiculous. They are unprofessional and wouldn’t recommend them to anyone. I’ve flown on virtually all airline companies and this is by far the worst. Please spend an additional $20-$50 and avoid the hassle.

### "Hawaiian Airlines is the absolute worst"
Avoid at all costs! This airline will change your flight time and then force you to take the flight or forfeit the flight cost, even if you can’t make the new flight time! This airlines is a scam! I’ve been to 45 countries and flown dozens of airlines and Hawaiian Airlines is the absolute worst. Pay the extra money to fly another airline so this doesn’t happen to you!

### "lie about their benefits"
I am a Pualani Platinum passenger (I fly every week) on Hawaiian Airlines. This airline, who market themselves as selling the warmth of the Hawaiian Islands is actually a heartless, cut throat business which in practice can care less about their customers. They literally lie about their benefits (such as being able to upgrade on line if seats are available in first class within 24 of your flight). Once I was flying and an engine caught fire. We had to make an emergency landing and stay in Maui for hours. Hawaiian issued $50.00 credits to the passengers on board. When I tried to use it the credit it was denied. The culture is one of profit only, customers. I've had enough and will now fly Southwest.

### "Since when did Hawaiian start lacking this much?"
Not Verified |  This was not a good flight. First of all they didn't have earphones for the passengers to watch their inflight movies. Or they ran out. Whatever the case, how are you a major airline and not have what is needed for the flight? Then it was cold, but guess what. They had no blankets! Come on now really?! Since when did Hawaiian start lacking this much? They finally served a sandwich for the 5.5 hour flight. A sandwich with lettuce, tomato and no meat. They need to go back to the days when they actually tried. Because this was not the best experience for my wife and I.

### "worst trip we have had on Hawaiian"
Not Verified |  Really the worst trip we have had on Hawaiian. Perhaps Covid was part of the problem, but the cabin crew was not concerned with the passengers. Seemed almost irritated that we were there. We had pre ordered a special meal. No explanation and no special meal, either. Maybe things will change after COVID, but right now we would not fly Hawaiian again.

### "disgusting food served"
Not Verified |  I have flown Hawaiian Air a number of times over the years and considered them top notch in all categories. My recent flight was different. I still admire Hawaiian’s efficiency and courtesy, but the food is a different story. I realize the COVID-19 era is challenging, but there is no excuse for the utterly disgusting food served. On the flight to Honolulu from Los Angeles, the meal was a warmed sandwich: a huge grinder bun with some cheese slopped on it and a sun dried piece of tomato. It was inedible. On the flight home, they served what was called a chicken sandwich. It was another bun with bits of chicken in a sauce of some kind. My husband, who will eat anything, took one bite and declared it “nasty,” I looked at what was inside and threw it away. There has to be some acceptable alternatives. Try harder!

### "They simply refused to honor 3 of the 4 vouchers"
Not Verified |  My wife and I booked our honeymoon through Hawaiian Airlines, through a third party. Due to covid we were unable to travel and had to cancel our flight. When contacting the third party, they said I should cancel the flights through Hawaiian Airlines. We called Hawaiian Airlines, who said we couldn't be refunded, but offered vouchers for a later trip. I accepted the vouchers. When I called Hawaiian Airlines to rebook the flights, they said that 3 of the 4 vouchers had been refunded. I received no refund. When I asked who authorized the refund they would not tell me. When I asked why they would give me vouchers and then cancel them, they refused to answer. When I asked why only 3 of the 4 were "refunded" they also refused to answer. They simply refused to honor 3 of the 4 vouchers totaling $1321.85. Don't fly with them, they will steal your money.

### "now been changed to a connecting flight"
Not Verified |  My original flight was a direct flight from Las Vegas to Maui, my flight has now been changed to a connecting flight in HNL without my choice. When I originally purchased the direct flight, it did cost more than the connecting flights that I am now on. I was willing to pay more for a direct flight due to obvious convenience and an earlier arrival time. I strongly believed that I should have been compensated for the following inconveniences: 1. The connecting flights are cheaper, and just on principle, we should receive the difference. 2. My experience dealing with the above changes: a. I get the change email, I try to contact via text, wait 2 hours for someone to text me back, once they do, I ask my questions, with hardly any answers, other than “due to current demands the direct flight is gone till May.” b. Due to the lack of help via text I decided it would be better to call someone. I waited on hold for another 75 minutes. I got someone nice enough to answer my questions and send me to this form. I filled out the form once, it did not send and erased what I originally put in this box plus a ticket number that I now have forgotten and cannot look up due to my flight change. c. All this just to find out that you choose my flight for me and even if I did have a choice, and I found something cheaper, such as the day before or after, you wouldn't automatically refund the difference!? 3. Inconvenience the actual flight change inflicts upon us. a. The original flight got us to Maui at 9:30 AM, new flight arrival is 3:30 PM, which takes away 6 hours of our vacation. b. The rental car that has already been booked now needs to be changed and may incur a fee. c. An early check-in at our hotel that we paid extra for, which we will not be refunded for. d. The added stress of finding a connected flight Customer service did nothing when I reached out to them about this, I also cc'd the CEO and he had no response as well.

### "it is terrible customer service"
Not Verified |  Hawaiian Airlines changed our flight during COVID to have a connection and doubled our total travel time. We intentionally booked with them to avoid connections (we're trying to limit our time in airports to not get COVID). They had an alternative direct flight on the same day that departed from a nearby airport. We called to ask to be switched to this flight, they said if we made that switch we would have to pay a $400 switching fee per person! I spent an hour on the phone with them, and they said that it was within their rights to switch the route on us. Though technically this might be true, it is terrible customer service to refuse an option that would avoid connections as we originally booked (and actually would be better for public health). Really terrible experience - I would recommend that they reconsider their customer service during COVID.

### "Medications taken from checked bag"
Medications taken from checked bag had no letter for TSA. and if they did take they would have asked me when I landed. This took me some time to make sure I did not mail to myself with other things. I made sure I did not make a mistake. So this was over the 24hr. Required to call police and file. So end the end I am out 3500 in medicine. This is quite upsetting. Do not fly with this Airline.

### "been wonderfully accommodating"
Not Verified | Ticket to fly to Honolulu for daughters college graduation from HPU in March of 2020. With the COVID-19 restrictions sadly we could not go, Hawaiian Airlines has been wonderfully accommodating from giving a voucher at first (to now daughter is being transferred to states, she is a Flight Engineer in the Navy also) now they are refunding a full refund.

### "essence of excellent customer service"
My adult son has cognitive delays, although he looks pretty normal, he gets lost very easily. Like drive to the store, go shopping and then is unable to find the car afterwards lost. So we called Hawaiian airlines to request assistance when he had to find his way through PDX to return to Honolulu. The agent on-line said to ask for a gate pass and then we would be able to accompany him to his gate. When we got to PDX and requested a gate pass we were informed that they were only available to military and children. So a supervisor was called. Mimi was wonderful. She was understanding and offered to escort him to the gate herself after he passed through security. All was well and he was able to get to the gate safely. Big shout out to Mimi at Portland airport. She was the essence of excellent customer service.

### "Greedy Hawaiian Airlines"
Not Verified | Honolulu to New York. This is a review of the airline policies - booked future travel RT for 2 to NYC in May - everything cancelled due to pandemic. Greedy Hawaiian Airlines is refusing to refund and transfer miles back to mileage account. Offering vouchers good until 12/31/2020. Uncertain whether we can even travel before the end of the year. Swapping spring trip for a winter trip? We are very senior and have to plan our travel carefully - when we are able to travel. Hawaiian Airlines is using the pandemic to make a grab for our comparatively scarce resources because they (think) they can.

### "Terrible customer service"
Not Verified |  Terrible customer service and lack of policies in place to handle the Covid-19 outbreak. Spent over 3 hours on the phone trying to navigate their travel waiver policy. Ended up having to pay fees that were supposed to be waived. Inflight entertainment was whack. I feel like their policies put myself and my pregnant wife at risk. Won’t ever be flying with Hawaiian again and I’ll pay extra to ensure I will never have to.

### "my preferred airline"
Hawaiian Airlines is my preferred airline. This was a full flight to Hilo and the female flight attendant was very friendly and served the passengers with a smile. The 2 other male flight attendants were not that friendly and seemed like they did not want to be there. In flight needs to be more friendly .

### "rude service by one staff"
Flight is okay but very rude service by one staff. I had to check in at the counter in Tokyo and the staff was the rudest I’ve encountered. They helped other customers first and made me wait. There was a look of scorn on the woman’s face. I have no idea why this happened. Japan Airlines has the friendliest staff 99% of the time, so this was a shock. The other staff was kind and helpful.

### "It’s a total ripoff"
Not Verified |  Maui to Sydney  via Honolulu. Asked for flight from Maui to Sydney on Hawaii Airlines. Booked me on HA (first leg) & Jetstar (second leg). Was led to believe had to fly Jetstar to Sydney ... found out today this is not true ... was lied to by somebody - could be that Flight Hub and/or HA makes more money by booking passengers on Jetstar. When found out there were HA flights to Sydney was told by Flight Hub that could only rebook on another Jetstar flight with still a day layover in Honolulu. To book both legs as HA makes existing tickets NON-refundable (ie, worthless). Have no choice but to rebook since Jetstar luggage restrictions are not medical condition friendly (have lots of bag weight due to medical stuff). Nobody stepped up to fix ... not Flight Hub ... not HA... not Jetstar. We worked our whole lives w/o any long vacations and now that we finally go on one we are sick to our stomachs and it hasn’t even started. Someone should have pointed this out or asked the right questions of us ... they are the travel experts - we are old but inexperienced in this travel stuff (lost about $1000 dollars so we’re not talking about a rebook or cancellation fee. It’s a total ripoff ... these companies should be avoided.

### "charges baggage fees each way"
Phoenix to Oahu. Even if you buy a ticket that says you can change your flight, you will be charged the fare difference and a $200 fare fee. You try calling in and they charge you the fare fee of $200 pus an additional $25 fee plus the difference in the fare. When you ask them to accommodate you, they say it is above their scope. It is a simple change in their system to change the flight and they try to say that it is specific in the ticket upon purchase- it is not. This is my first time flying with them and it will be my last. My boss bought my ticket and it is the only reason I am on Hawaiian Airlines. Hawaiian Airlines charges baggage fees each way - checked bag fees are $30 for the first bag each way (that is nuts) when Southwest you can fly to Hawaii and receive a free bag checked and change your flight without a fee, simply pay the difference of the fare. Lastly, even if I wanted to cancel my flight and I paid for the ticket that had the option to do so, I would only receive a travel credit and upon using that travel credit would be charged a $200 fee. Seriously amazed how this airline is still in business with all these rules. I am so disgusted they charge so many fees for no reason especially when there are so many airline options that people can choose from.

### "check you will sit together!"
Not Verified |  
Auckland to Honolulu. We are a family of three, my husband and I were travelling back home with our two year old, we checked in four hours before flight time, so you would think you would get good seats, or even sit together? They seat us in different seats (behind each other) but that is not the point, we are a family we don't have to request to sit together? there were three seats and four seats in the center isles and we could have sat there together, this was our worst flight ever, having to move a toddler back and forth between me and my husband was just terrible! I would not recommend, but if you do go as a family or even a couple double check that you will sit together! didn't think I had to do that

### "customer service was horrible"
Sydney to Boston via Honolulu . The entire experience with Hawaiian Airlines was absolutely shocking. The seats we uncomfortable, the entertainment selection was low in comparison to what one would normally expect for long international flights, the ear buds provided didn't fit inside the socket properly which made it very difficult to listen to music or watch a movie without physically holding the cord in place. The aircon was freezing cold and dry, causing my nose to bleed through the flight and for at least 2 days following. When I asked the crew for another blanket because they weren't able to do anything about the temperature, I was told I could only use the one so the entire flight (all 4 flights that I had booked in fact for the one return trip) was miserable. I have never in my life had plane food that was as horrible as the food on Hawaiian and they had no options to give you. I didn't eat any of the food provided. With all of this in mind, it would have been nice to think that the staff may have been a little extra courteous to make up for the short comings of the company, but they seemed disinterested and almost too used to the complaints they were receiving to care any more. When we reached our halfway mark and had to transfer planes, there was next to no direction given on where we were meant to go or where to leave our luggage for the next flight. We ended up running to catch our next flight and were told to leave the luggage on a spot in the middle of the airport without any security whatsoever. After running and just making it to our next gate, we were told that the gate had moved so we, again, ran to the next gate so as not to miss the flight. After finally arriving the the appropriate gate, we found out that our flight had been delayed by several hours. I understand that delays happen, but the way it was handled and with the rest of the flight in mind, it was disappointing. To top it all off, when we finally arrived to our last destination, we were told that our luggage had, of course, been lost. They gave us provisions to pay for basic necessities but could not guarantee we would see our luggage again, which held all of our wedding clothes and decorations inside which, they let us know, would not be replaced if the luggage was not found. This was a horrible way to start what was a long awaited vacation and the start to our wedding. When we tried to speak with them at the end about all of the troubles, they were only willing to offer us a ticket to fly with them again for an amount that wouldn't get us anywhere, we would need to cover the rest of the cost of the ticket and didn't want to hear another word about it. The customer service was horrible along with everything about the flights that we had with them. It was the first and last time we will be booking with them. We are disgusted.

### "cabin staff were amazing"
Honolulu to Phoenix. I have flown Hawaiian severs times within the Islands and several times to the US mainland and this experience to Phoenix was consistent with those flights: amazing cabin crew and onboard food, with poor ground service and management choices that make Hawaiian not a premium airline which is unfortunate for the excellent cabin staff. When compared to southwest, Hawaiian charges for checked bags and even enforces a 50 dollar fee for business class to the mainland for baggage above 50 pounds when both American, Delta, and United check 70 pound baggage in business. The ground staff seemed angry at the passengers and were not helpful. However they did seem understaffed and had to deal with many passengers who were confused of where to go so this was probably more on management creating their poor service. The lounge was basic. On-board, the seats looked modern and sleek but lacked padding and were not very comfortable. Better than a recliner on a 737 to and from Hawaii but not as comfortable as united 777’s to Hawaii (although it does have the advantage of not sitting 4 in the middle like united a domestic 777). The cabin staff were amazing. They addressed every passenger by name and were fantastic. They also thanked each individual passenger for flying with them before landing. The food was very good. Average entertainment delivered through an IPad. Summary of what was good: great cabin crew and food. Average: the seats and entertainment. Poor: ground service and lounge. Hawaiian does not compete with LCCs to Hawaii and because of small things isn’t a premium airline like what they want to market themselves because of some management choices. Can’t call United, Delta, or American “premium” airlines either but are better because of small things in business class so long as you with the draw and get a good flight crew with them.

### Hawaiian Airlines customer review
My flight was from Seattle to Maui to Honolulu to Auckland. I had only one reference number for the tickets. I’m planning to stay in the airport overnight as I had a long layover. Weeks prior to my flights I talked and emailed the customer service in their website. I asked them where I will claim my 2 checked in baggage. They all said in my final destination which is NZ. To my surprise they check out my bags in Honolulu and I can’t come back inside the airport coz they said my flight is on the next day. I almost didn’t have place to stay that night carrying my suitcases because hotels cost a big amount and mostly fully booked. Most of their employees I encountered were rude, arrogant and unprofessional. They even told me that their customer service doesn’t use emails. I told them I have communication thru email from their website and I called them for confirmation. One more thing, my flight was not comfortable. The plane is to cold. You need to buy a $10 blanket. Never again..

### "never fly another airline"
Maui to Seattle. We will never fly another airline to Hawaii. I was not seated in first class but it sure felt like I was. Nicki made sure I had everything I needed as well as got me hot water, cup of noodles and my free mai tai. Asked us how we were and was so pleasant.

### "characteristics of aloofness"
Auckland to Honolulu. I've flown Hawaiian Airlines twice, once each domestically and internationally. Never again, if I can help it. The queue times at the gate aren't particularly long, as the flights are boarded efficiently. The meals are fine, in my experience. The entertainment options have some interesting public interest sort of programs about Hawaiian life and culture. But the staff, whether at check-in, the gate or on the plane, work efficiently, they're robotic. Meaning, they seem to exude the characteristics of aloofness and just being miserable. They're doing their jobs obligatorily, so obviously, and they just don't seem to enjoy serving customers. I don't have an explanation as to why, as they're shuttling passengers to and from paradise. Maybe Hawaiian doesn't treat their staff well?

### "the inflight service is very basic"
Honolulu to Sydney with Hawaiian Airlines. We purchased seats in the quiet comfort row as I was travelling with my wife and 2 children aged 5 and 1 to ensure we had space to let them sleep and allowed for more leg room. Boarding was smooth and staff friendly. However the inflight service is very basic. The major problem is the inflight service. They serve a meal as you reach cruising altitude and then another just before landing. This leaves around 6 hours of no food or refreshments or something to break up the 10 hour flight. They do offer additional food to be bought which a lot of passengers were taking up due to the time gaps between meals. This was a day flight so not alot of people were sleeping. The staff occasionally walk around to offer water but it was up to individuals to be proactive if they wanted anything more. Given the time between meals, it would be good to see them bring drink options through the aisles as the attendants mainly were sitting around chatting (at least I perceived this). When you compare to other airlines, it just appears unprofessional. The staff were pleasant and friendly but it was just the level of service I would say is sub par. Meals were very ordinary and there is no choice of meal either so be prepared to eat whatever they have, ie no vegetarian or kids meals etc. The big appeal was baggage limit i.e 2 X 32kg checked luggage and the extra comfort, you really do get extra leg room. They provided an amenity kit but I didn't have.much use for it. Inflight entertainment was ok but not a large depth of films/shows considering its 10 hrs there and 10 hrs back.

### "a terrible experience"
San Francisco to Kona. We planned a Hawaiian trip a couple of weeks before the Christmas holidays. We booked Hawaiian Airlines through a third party website, paying a premium price for the tickets as a result. We did not realize that it was main cabin basic - which the cheapest class on the fare list. We had a terrible experience with the onward and the return journey. It seems that the airline has no regard for customers that have this class of tickets. They treat them as if they are doing them a favor and are very rude. They treat you as a zone 6 - which is the last to board. During our onward journey, they told us that we cannot carry our cabin bags as the flight was full. We were ok to check-in all of the cabin bags except one as it had costly camera equipment. The ‘agent’ as they call them was so arrogant that she told that she would re-book us on another flight if we were not ready to check-in that bag too. I then asked what if the equipment gets damaged, she was haughty and said we could claim it later! I am astonished by the disregard she had for customers. We had an equally bad experience on our return journey too. The airline does not allow you to choose seats during check-in because of the class. I had injured my leg and needed assistance, so we called in the customer service to request them to seat us together. They told us that they would service the request at the gate. At the gate, the agent again said he would process our request when it comes, and it was placed last (mostly because of the fare class). He then said that by the time he got to the request, all the seats were taken and could give both aisle seats. Once we boarded, another agent came and made us change our seats, seating us far apart in spite of telling her my situation. She also was haughty and said to us that we were not assigned seats in the first place! We wished we had never flown this airline. The agents have an attitude towards so-called `cheap` ticket class - I wonder why do they even have it in the first place if they loathe them. I will never again fly with this airline.

### "asked me to pay the NZeTA "
Honolulu to Auckland in May 2019. Traumatic experience with Hawaiian airline. At the time of Check in they asked me to pay the NZeTA of USD12 but I was in possession of a working holiday visa to New Zealand that allowed me to be free of NZeTA. I showed them on the website of New Zealand government that I was exempted in case of possession of the Working Holiday Visa. He did not want to hear me telling me to pay not to talk. In Auckland I explained my situation, what happened in Hawaii with them to New Zealand immigration, they were surprised.

### "This is total rubbish and disgusting"
Not Verified |  Honolulu to Seattle. I will never fly Hawaiian Airlines nor I will recommend anyone to fly this Airline. We have a little one under 2 and we called Hawaiian Airlines customers service to confirm. During that time the customer service agent assigned our seat in the middle row. I asked specifically to have a window or aisle seat. When we boarded we realized the customer the service agent assigned us in the middle. The flight was full so the gate agent couldn't change it either. This is total rubbish and disgusting. Never again I will fly Hawaiian Airlines.

### "thumbs down to Hawaiian Airlines"
Hawaiian Airlines is awful! Most of their US based locations do not have a club lounge and when you arrive to Honolulu to transfer to another flight they do not honor your first class upgrade. Also, the boarding process is awful. You pay more but you board after about 25 to 50 people. So, save your money and do not book with Hawaiian Airlines! You get treated way better in other airlines. The staff at the lounge in Honolulu was extremely rude. So, thumbs down to Hawaiian Airlines.

### "it’s always been great before today"
Not Verified |  Two of us bought round trip tickets for Oahu with the same confirmation number. Flew from Maui to Honolulu at 6.10 am. Return was for 6.30 pm. Mid trip, Hawaiian Airlines changed my confirmation number mid trip! I could check in my boyfriend but not me. Then Hawaiian Airlines gave me attitude after talking to two reps. All they could do was try (3 times) looking for my confirmation number. I had to spell it out about 6 times. Then they couldn’t even check me in. Said I had to go back online. That is the worst process and stupidest customer service I’ve ever had. I have flown Hawaiian Airlines several times, and it’s always been great before today.

### "unprofessional and horrible customer service"
Not Verified |  Honolulu to Boston. Horrendous experience. My flight was delayed and after waiting on the plane for hours, they changed my flight. They gave me a different itinerary so now I had American Airlines for my second flight. Once I arrived at my layover destination, American Airlines tells me they cannot find my ticket. They call Hawaiian and Hawaiian says I’m supposed to take Jetblue even though the paper they gave me says American Airlines. They refuse to do anything about it. I did not even get an apology for their mistake. They told me I had to take it up with Jetblue. Extremely unprofessional and horrible customer service. They do not care.

### "provided minimum customer service"
Not Verified |  
I flew with premium economy seat from Auckland to Honolulu. (11 hour journey). The leg room and the seat was reasonably good. I was so shocked when I saw how small and tight the economy seats behind me were. (Seats and leg room are much smaller than usual.) Food was just a pack of cold sandwich and juice for the whole journey. Flight attendants basically disappeared in between food time. No conversation, not many smiles on their face, no interaction with passengers. They provided minimum customer service. During my return journey (back to Auckland). I was not feeling well and had a temperature. I decided to upgrade myself to First Class so I could lay down and have some rest. The upgrading process was done over the counter at the airport. Staff: no smiles but got it done very quickly. Returning flight: Seat was able to fully decline to a flatbed. The service was so different from those premium economy or economy. Flight attendants made conversation with those first class passengers with a smile. What a surprise! Food is average but of course it is considered to be much better than the cold sandwich and packed juice. I fedback to the flight attendant that my blanket smelt awful and requested to change to another one. It smelt like it hadn't been washed for at least more than a month. She replied me saying that there was no spare blanket around, so she couldn't do anything. Giving me that kind of "Take it or leave it" attitude and just walked away. I was so disappointed. They called it "First Class cabin". I was feeling so cold the whole journey. Bear in mind that I was not feeling well and this experience was really poor. Yes, I agreed that the cost of their airtickets are slightly cheaper than other airlines but I would not fly with them anymore. I rather pay a bit more to get at least reasonable service.

### "marketing ploy to get passengers to buy"
New York to Honolulu. The flight left on schedule and the flight was same as the one we had from Honolulu to New York few days prior. One thing I did notice was that they first went through the the drink and food cart to sell them. Then, they went through the second time providing the meal with complementary alcoholic beverages and drinks. I got little confused at first on the first run of the of the food cart with the accompanying announcement thinking I had to purchase the drinks and food until the the meal cart came through. Probably a marketing ploy to get passengers to buy. Anyway, given that US domestic services offered by all airlines including the big three operate on budget airline model of charging for everything, it is to be expected if you live in the States. Other than that, for other aspects of the flight my previous comments stand.

### "big disappointment was the IFE"
Sydney to New York via Honolulu. First time flying on Hawaiian Airlines after more than 20 years of not flying with them. Flight leg from Sydney to Honolulu was full. Unique part of the airline is the Hawaiian culture it promoted in the background music, style of food offered during the flight, and the flight attendant uniform. Having lived in Honolulu during my early 20's with many local friends, it does bring back memories. However, staying on the subject at hand, the seats were average quality, food was better than average for the most part, alcoholic beverage was free, and the service was as expected of an average carrier. One negative is the time between serving and picking up the tray is too short. If they have another 10-15 minutes that would have been comfortable time given for a meal. The one big disappointment was the IFE. The selection was limited and you could not play until after the plane had taken off and the IFE was stopped about 30 minutes before landing. They could learn from carriers like Air NZ, Emirates, Qantas, and Virgin Australia and update their system to play IFE from the moment the passengers board to disembark when they land. After all, they are competing with some of these carriers from Australia to US. As we were transferring to another A330 in Honolulu to New York, the baggage transfer information was provided on the plane and it was easy to locate the counter after the Customs. We left Honolulu on time and the flight to New York was pretty much a repeat of our journey from Sydney to Honolulu.

### "fly another airline if you can"
Las Vegas to Kona via Honolulu. My wife is terminally ill. In May 2019, I purchased two first class round trip tickets from Kona Hawaii to JFK NYC for medical treatment. I paid $8800 for these two tickets. I had to cancel for emergency medical reasons. I was issued a voucher for the $8800. In July, I attempted to use the voucher to buy tickets for the same route. The online price was $8800 but they wouldn’t accept the voucher. I had to call customer service. I was told that the same tickets that I was looking at online would cost me $17,000 because I was using a voucher. I decided to go to Las Vegas on Hawaiian and then on to NYC on their partner airline, Jet Blue. They told me that I couldn’t use the voucher to travel with Jet Blue. I asked for two first class tickets r/t from Kona to Vegas and back. The cost for these two tickets was $3400. Hawaiian told that I could only use the voucher once and that they would be keeping the remaining $5400. When I asked why, I was rudely told to “go read your contract”! The trip from Kona to Vegas was mediocre, the food on the menu some foreign unpronounceable dish. I asked for bread and butter but they didn’t have any. The return trip from Vegas to Kona was horrible. I arrived at the airport an hour before takeoff, at 08:30. Hawaiian told the rental car shuttle bus driver that they didn’t have any wheelchair available. I went into the terminal and there must have been 10 wheelchairs at the Hawaiian check in kiosk. After getting my wife in the terminal, when I went to check in, at 08:45. I was told that they had released my two tickets and the aircraft doors were already closed! I immediately said “it’s 45 minutes before takeoff” and the attendant replied “you are not going to make it through TSA” and “your luggage will never make it in time”. She checked us in and notified the boarding gate that we were on the way and that our tickets should be reinstated, it’s was now 08:50. The SAS personnel at McCarran Airport were outstanding. They rushed my wife in a wheelchair, through TSA, on the tram and around the terminal to the boarding gate. We got there at 09:05 and they had just started board the main cabin. The flight left on time but again the meal was some unpronounceable name. I asked for bread and butter and was offered a croissant. When we got to Honolulu, it was raining, This time Hawaiian provided a wheelchair but I had to push my wife through the terminals. The connecting flight was delayed for almost an hour and the boarding gate had been changed but no announcement was made. Upon arrival in Kona it was pouring rain. My wife was transported off the aircraft and I was asked if I would mind pushing her wheelchair through the rain to baggage claim. So if you are thinking of flying first class with Hawaiian, save yourself a lot of money and fly in the main cabin. As a matter of fact, fly another airline if you can. The service is the same but the tickets are a little cheaper. As for me, I will never fly on Hawaiian Airlines again.

### "a very positive experience"
Not Verified |  Los Angeles to Kona. I expected much less. First time on Hawaiians new narrow body aircraft across the Pacific. I had a very positive experience. Very comfortable seating (far better then Delta or American or United on similar aircraft). The service was excellent and the food was actually delicious. Had a great staff and experienced aloha from start to finish which isn’t always the case. I will definitely take this flight again. Only complaint, Hawaiian stubbornly refuses to install Wi-Fi. That's just stupid.

### "still recommend this airline"
Not Verified |  Oakland to Kauai. Flight was pretty pleasant although we were sitting in the rear of the plane, which is not my favorite spot o the plane. You needed to download the Entertainment app, though , and then you had to buy the movies. I would still recommend this airline.

### "cancelled with insufficient notice"
Long Beach to Honolulu. Our flight was cancelled with insufficient notice, no explanation and in order to reroute us, we were charged $150.00. Also had to pay extra for car rental!

### "unreliable planes"
Not Verified | Sacramento to Honolulu. Soon there will be an alternative to flying Hawaiian out of Sacramento to Honolulu nonstop - Southwest will start in January and I will never fly Hawaiian again. Why do I detest Hawaiian so much? Because of their high prices, outdated and unreliable planes (frequent mechanical problems), packed seating, terrible entertainment (only option is their horrible Hawaiian music videos, which never vary noticeably), shameless hawking of their credit card to a captive audience, self-congratulatory preening because they serve a (terrible) "meal" in coach, and to cap it all off, undeviating penalties that hammer you whenever you need to alter a reservation.

### "flight attendants did not interact with the passengers"
Maui to Sydney via Honolulu with Hawaiian Airlines. This 12.50 pm flight left Honolulu on time. Once we were in the air we were instructed to close all the window blinds and the meal was served immediately. The flight attendants then turned out the lights and disappeared for the remainder of the flight. (In the main cabin, in any case, perhaps the experience in business class was different.) They have a lounge built into the middle of the plane, and they spent the entire flight taking turns slipping in and out of it while ignoring the passengers. Meanwhile, we spent the entire 11-hour, daytime flight in the dark, with window blinds down and all the lights turned out. I felt like the intention was to make it feel like night time so everyone would sleep and not be a bother. Other than breezing down the aisle with a water bottle a couple of times, the flight attendants did not interact with the passengers in the main cabin until they came around with the second-service sandwiches - one hour before landing. Seven and a half hours into the flight I caught up with one of the attendants as he was unlocking the lounge for his turn inside, and asked him about food. Without looking at me he said he didn't know what time it was but the food was usually served 1.5 to 2 hours before landing. He then turned his back and slipped into the lounge, locking the door behind him. An hour and a half before landing there was some activity in the galley but still no food. By this time it had been 8 hours since the meal, with nothing offered in between but water. I went back and asked if we were going to be getting our sandwiches and I was cheerfully told it was coming. Half an hour later - one hour before landing on an 11-hour flight - they passed out sandwiches, then started through with the drink cart. The automated overhead message saying food service was ending due to proximity of landing came on while they were doing this. So, basically, for an 11-hour daytime flight the flight attendants served the meal immediately, turned out all the lights and disappeared until one hour before landing. They spent the entire flight taking turns in their private lounge and otherwise staying completely out of sight, then reappeared for the second meal service as we were about to land. I know the flight attendants are there primarily for safety and the customer service part of it may seem, to them, secondary. But for passengers, whether a long flight is bearable or unbearable rests largely on the quality of the crew. I felt in this case they planned the flight for their own convenience and comfort and didn't care about their passengers even a little. I would never book a long flight on Hawaiian again, and I wouldn't recommend this airline to anyone.

### "carbohydrates in the breakfast"
San Diego to Honolulu. We boarded the plane on Sunday August 18 2019. Everyone was very nice. Until we encounter a rude flight attendant. I called for her attention very politely. She, on the other hand, was annoyed by me even calling her over. My question was how many carbohydrates were in the complimentary breakfast. As a type 1 diabetic is very important for me to know. Well, she was extremely rude, no intention to even try to figure out how many carbs the breakfast had. Again the entire time she seem annoyed. But later we saw her being completely different with the family in front of us. She was nice, talkative and polite. I am extremely upset that the do not provide the nutritional facts for food which legally they should.

### "it has strongly improved"
Honolulu to Kahului. After previous hard experiences with inter-islands Hawaiian service, I must confess that it has strongly improved. Baggage rules are now clear. Ground staff is ready to help you to comply with them. Boarding was not chaotic anymore. As usual FA were helpful and smiling. Maybe Southwest Airlines completion on this monopoly market is resulting in a positive effect.

### "we got to board early"
Not Verified |  My mother and I flew from San Francisco to Honolulu in the Extra Comfort Seating. We got to the airport early and dropped off our luggage. Staff at the check-in counter made it easy to check us in and give us our boarding passes. The boarding started on time and we got to board early thanks to our extra comfort seating. The plane was OLD. The IFE was very unresponsive and there were no personal air vents. We took off perfectly on time. After takeoff, the cabin crew came around with various items for purchase, such as snacks, earphones, and blankets. The IFE selection was small but had some new movies. The cabin crew came came around with complimentary drinks and a free meal, one of the big positives of Hawaiian Airlines. I ordered and POG (Passion Orange Guava) juice and was given a sandwich with mushroom and mayo on white bread, which tasted pretty good. I thought the meal/drink service was finished for the time being but then the same cabin crew came back and offered me the can of POG juice. The cabin crew often came around with water. As the flight ended, another drink service commenced and cabin crew handed out customs cards for Hawaii and offered everyone free maps of the island of Oahu. After landing, it took a while to find our luggage out of the baggage claim, but we eventually found out and were on our way to Waikiki beach.

### "you'll get nothing and like it"
Honolulu to Phoenix. Given the competition, I am surprised people even fly Hawaiian. Premium economy gets you 2 things, a seat with a few more inches and boarding just one zone earlier. Even United (historically the worst) gives you free drinks in that class. The A330 has no passenger controlled air vents and the smallest overhead luggage bins on a widebody I have ever seen. The crews on Hawaiian definitely lived up to the island credo of "no worries", which translated into, you'll get nothing and like it. Food, drinks, information, etc. I have not seen that level of unprofessionalism on a flight since the last time I flew United many years ago. Hopefully now that Southwest is coming to the island, they will figure it out.

### "Hawaiian Airlines is not up to it"
My family and I were booked on the July 14 2019 flight New York to Honolulu which was scheduled to depart at 10 AM. The cabin crew had arrived on the HNL-JFK flight 26 hours earlier. There was a blackout in Manhattan on the evening prior, although power was fully restored by midnight. This had supposedly affected the ability of some of these personnel to get sufficient sleep. Nevertheless, they all turned up to work on the morning of 14 July. However, at about 9am, the pilots decided they had had insufficient sleep. HA found some replacement pilots by about 11 am. However, at that point, the cabin crew decided that they had also had insufficient rest hours. They wandered off for their 10 hours rest, which commenced when they reached the hotel, around midday. The rest of us were pretty much stuck at JFK for the duration. So we had some time to look around, including wandering over to terminal 4 to look at alternatives (Delta, it didn't work, but that's a whole other story). For what it's worth, and I looked extensively at the airport and online, I am not aware of another flight leaving JFK that day that was delayed due to the impact of the blackout on crew. The HA JFK ground personnel, who all had to pull a ~19 hour shift (and were great) handed out lunch and dinner vouchers and then $300 discount vouchers for future flights. Arriving back at the terminal around 11 pm, it seemed likely from the shopping bags they brought that at least some of the members of the cabin crew had spent some of their additional 10 hours in Manhattan productively... The flight departed after 1 am on Monday 15 July, more than 15 hours late. They then set up the crew sleeping quarters in 45-46 C-G, and left the fasten belts sign illuminated for most of the flight. We arrived in HNL at 5 am local time with the crew gregarious and friendly and the passengers weary. I personally had by that time been awake for 30 hours and had to stay up all day to get back on time. A family we met on the flight advised that the same thing had happened to them on a BNE-HNL flight - they were actually flying on the vouchers they received that time. Issues for HA to consider: 1. How is it possible that even with a blackout, your cabin crew did not have the opportunity to get 10 hours rest in the preceding 24 hours? Do you not have early check in arrangements with Manhattan hotels? Why are other airlines able to handle the impact of a 5 hr blackout on crew? 2. If your crew aren't going to play ball, or the flight isn't leaving for any reason, please advise your customers as early as possible. 3. Your passengers are mostly heading out on vacation. Surely it would cost HA a lot less to pay your cabin crew a "hardship bonus" or overtime rather than absorb the cost and PR impact of stealing a day of vacation from 250 passengers, for something less than a pretty good reason? 4. HA and its personnel appear to have an attitude well suited to island hopping, but not well adapted to the rigors and challenges of long haul operations. So HA should stick to island hopping. Under no circumstances would I ever again use Hawaiian Airlines for anything else. It is a fact of life that flights can be delayed. Reasons can include weather, emergencies of various kinds, mechanical issues, etc. The mission for long haul operators is to get aircraft in the air despite the challenges. Hawaiian Airlines is not up to it.

### "Very disappointed"
Not Verified |  Very disappointed with the quality of offerings. No WiFi, only beef option for breakfast going. Returning again no WiFi. We did not get offered water although some passengers did. Had to ask for a soda. Although I made reservations more than a month ago, my wife and I did not have seats together until I went to the ticket counter. The agent booked us through to Phoenix (connecting in LA) he did not have my wife and I together.

### "difficulties on the return flight"
Portland to Honolulu. The flight to HNL was without any hiccups. The flights were on time and the staff was friendly. My difficulties came on the return flight. I had made a separate reservation for my Dad and his dog to fly on the same flight I was booked on, with a stop in Maui. I called reservations to attach the dog to the ticket because we were going to put in on as luggage. I spent an hour on the phone trying to get this complete. The staff on the phone made no indication that a stop in Maui would be any sort of problem. Upon checking in at HNL, it went as smooth as I could have expected. The staff checking us in inquired with someone about what notes needed to be made in order to ensure safe delivery for my Dads pet with the stop in Maui. She was satisfied with the answer, so she sent us along. In Maui, I received a phone call indicating that the plane to Portland could not support the pet, so I'd have to go back to HNL, where I just came from! Because the dog was being handled so much he was getting too anxious, thus we needed to come down to meet him. This was after a gate attendant tried to get us on a flight back to HNL. She was kind enough to offer a food voucher (which I could not use because I spent all of our time in the security line). We settled the dog, waited in the security line, for the second time that day and made the flight just in time. What a waste of time and communication. My Dad with breathing and walking difficulties was being taken from one side of the airport to another, a lot more walking than he anticipated, along with the stress he's feeling in regard to his dog. Back to HNL we go and make it in time for the direct flight to Portland. I was not offered any kind of compensation, acknowledgement of the mistake nor did I feel that anyone cared about the distress this caused during this whole fiasco. I had paid for Extra Comfort seats and for the two different people in Maui was trying to do the rebooking, they did not notice this until I pointed it out, twice. So, had I not mentioned it, there was a possibility that I would have got economy seats and I would have lost that added expense. I could not lose my cool because I didn't want my Dad to stress more. I have never encountered such an experience. I felt like this was something I should have known ahead of time rather than an oversight on the airline's part, not once, but twice. With the rising cost of their airline tickets and all the 'for purchase' items, it's becoming harder and harder to make the trip back to visit the family that I do have left there. The crew on the aeroplane was friendly and checked in often. I have flown a pet before and this horrific visit was a far cry from my first. I was relocating my Dad and this day actually made him question the decision, saying, maybe this wasn't a good idea. I kept my cool and did my best not to show my frustration.

### "never use this airline again"
Los Angeles to Honolulu. We are from the UK and this was our first time using Hawaiian Airlines  and we were very disappointed. We paid 80 Dollars each to upgrade to Premium Seats and although the interior of the plane was light and airy and clean, we thought the service was shocking. The temperature was so cold everyone was putting on sweaters and jackets. When we mentioned how cold it was to the cabin crew they offered us a blanket for 10 Dollars each. We think this was a deliberate ploy in order to sell blankets. No meal was provided just light snacks, fair enough, and we were offered complimentary drinks, my daughter and I both requested Diet Coke and were given one can between us and asked to share it - unbelievable penny pinching. We would never use this airline again

### "cabin staff marginally more friendly"
Not Verified |  Honolulu to Auckland. Return leg following previous review of outbound leg. This was an improvement on the outward journey. Cabin etc fairly identical though a newer aircraft. Food was better and cabin staff marginally more friendly. IFE was ok and departure/arrival times were as predicted. Beware the 10 min delay to be gassed with insecticide at AKL airport - this appears to becoming a more frequent addendum to the experience and I would stress, this is nothing to do with Hawaiian Airlines - though they could have advised us there would be a delay after landing.

### "negative thing is inflight food"
Sydney to Honolulu. Hawaiian Airlines A330 was spacious and new aircraft. Seating configuration was 2-4-2 in economy class. Boarding was swift and was before time, we push-backed before the departure time of 9.40pm. Aircraft was clean, spacious and cabin crew was smiling in Hawaiian style. I liked that the flight captain instructed the passengers to keep the window shades down to keep in mind that the other passengers would be sleeping. Generous baggage allowance of 32kgs per checked bag and 2 bags were allowed per person. Both the sectors’ flights departed and arrived before time and the baggage was loaded on the carousel swiftly at Sydney while arriving back into Australia. Check-in staff at Honolulu airport was very helpful. We only carried 23 kgs per bag (had 4 bags each) as the ticket was on Virgin Australia, however the staff said we can carry 32kgs per bag (total 4 bags). Even without requesting, he inserted “interline transfer” tags on all our 4 checked bags and due to this, our bags were the first ones to arrive in Sydney. This erased my worry of time delays as we only had 2hrs and 20 mins at Sydney before our connecting flight to Melbourne. The only negative thing is about inflight food on both Hawaiian Airlines flights. On departing from Sydney, we were given a small snack pack consisting of less than one sandwich, a non-edible chocolate cake piece and few cut fruits. Morning breakfast tray was very small and was equally bad. On the return flight to Sydney, afternoon lunch was boiled noodles with few veges, cut fruits and grated cabbage in vinegar. Just before arrival into Sydney, we were given a very tiny bag consisting of 1 small sandwich and small sized apple. I know that US airlines are not customer friendly, but on these medium to long-haul flights, food trays should be good. Food service was the only part which took down Hawaiian Airlines. Hopefully they improve on this, considering their flight tickets are expensive.

### "cant even stretch my legs out"
Lihue to Oakland. I am extremely annoyed seeing as I paid for an extra comfort seat and I cant even stretch my legs out because of the non-movable wall located in front of my seat. I'm 6 feet tall and have terrible knees. What's the point of paying for comfort if I'm better off just paying for an econ seat.

### "Cabin crew not great"
Not Verified |  Auckland to Honolulu. First time in Economy class for a while so possibly a bit biased. The seat adequate and nothing more. Reclined seat in front unexpectedly claustrophobic. Cabin crew not great to be honest, appeared disorganized and not friendly at all until leaving the aircraft. Food was dreadful on any scale for a 9hr flight. Otherwise ok and on time.

### "I would avoid Hawaiian Airlines"
The new non stop Hawaiian Airlines route between Boston and Honolulu cost me more than $1,900. It started out at the boarding gate with about six employees looking everywhere but at their customers. Only one overwhelmed woman had a clue. It seemed that they were too busy training their other employees. Holding a first class ticket I expected that when it was time to board there would be an announcement . Nope. Instead they called that they were boarding anyone who needed special assistance. Ok. Like people who are elderly or in wheel chairs get to board first....this wasn't the case...They let about 25 kids and their parents board in coach first ..while I waited and waited. I'm sorry but 30 people sitting in coach should not take priority over your first class customers except if someone is actually handicapped. Bad start. After boarding I was offered a drink. The seat was nice although no one greeted me to tell me how the the seat worked. No one greeted me by my name. There are only a handful of first class passengers. Jet Blue Mint first class greets you as soon as you board..by your name and they take the time to show you how your seat works. (Jet Blue Mint cross country is as little as $499.) Next came the flight attendant who requested I order my food for the entire 12 hour flight including what I wanted to drink. Ok but I'm not sure at 9am what I want to drink 10 hours latter. I ordered the "Veggie" option. When the first meal arrived it was a soggy quiche, stale bready croissant, unripe boring melon and get this..a glass of red wine. She put the food down and disappeared. Next came the 13 inch iPad entertainment they passed out. They had a few good movies and I watched The Green Book and Bohemian Rhapsody. I was hungry again after the poor quality breakfast and was informed that all they have is potatoes chips and the next meal won't be served until an hour before we arrive in Honolulu about ten hours later. But a flight attendant came thru first class selling box snacks. Really? $1900 dollars one way and they are selling me a snack because I'm still hungry? I passed. A little while latter I walked back to Premium Comfort and asked the flight attendant there (because the first class flight attendants had blocked off their station with a table of potato chips and disappeared for most of the flight) if I could possible get something to eat. Her cold response: "You are in first class go up there. OK so I go back and ask the flight attendant if I can have a snack box. She says "I'm busy now changing over the flight deck, I'll just be a minute". After listening to her and a male crew member laugh and talk for at least 15 minutes I determined that she completely forgot about me. I went up and asked again. She apologized and brought me a complimentary snack box that had a few chips and two bites of hummus in it. I was never offered anything to eat again until about 10 hours later when the main meal arrived. I looked across at the "veggie" meal that my fellow passenger was eating and thought oh boy that looks mushy and I think I ordered the wrong thing. Not to worry because when she brought my food she brought me the wrong meal and I was given a dry semi cold piece of chicken and stale bread with one piece of butter. No one ever came by and asked me if I wanted anything else. I would avoid Hawaiian Airlines in the future. Its only good for the seat. Service dialed in, food poor. First class? Not.

### "seats in economy class are really cramped"
Not Verified |  I have travelled on most of the major airlines all over the world and by far this is the worst airline I have come across. This was my first trip to Hawaii on Hawaiian Airlines. The seats in economy class are really cramped. They just want to make money out of anything and everything. They asked for $10 for a simple blanket. Entertainment system sucks. They ask you to download their stupid entertainment app, which of course, worked only with in-flight wifi. And, lo, you have to buy packages if you want to watch anything. I have never had experience with any airlines so far that asks money for in-flight entertainment. The snacks they offer have no choice. If you ask them to replace the meat item with a veg then you will get a simple answer - this is all we have. C'mmon do you expect anyone that boards your flight, to eat meat? I am not going to fly this airline ever.

### "Constant delays"
Monopoly at its finest! Constant delays. I flew 6 weeks in a row without leaving on time. Every single time my flight was delayed by at least 30 minutes. Thankfully Southwest is offering Kona to Honolulu flights in May. I'm never flying on Hawaiian Airlines as long as another option is available. Sick and tired of always flying in late to Oahu.

### "monopoly on air travel"
Kahului to Honolulu. Horrid. They have monopoly on air travel here in Hawaii and they are behaving as such. Agents barely speak English,  and god forbid you need to make any changes to your reservations. Planes are filthy (inter-island routes) and so are their terminals. I used them to fly to South Korea and even their trans-oceanic flights are way below their competitors level in service and overall experience.

### "responded by apologising profusely"
Not Verified |  Well, Hawaiian have now investigated their screw up for 2 weeks and responded by apologising profusely and given me a $400 e-Ticket with strings attached. That it takes 2 weeks to investigate an admitted huge and obvious screw-up of this magnitude, shows how little Hawaiian really cares for its customers. Having said that, they completely fail to appreciate why they screwed up. After 2 weeks, they think it was a training problem. It wasn’t. Their employees (all 4 of them including 2 supervisors) followed their policies and procedures, so training won’t change anything. The screw-up I experienced had nothing to do with training. It was entirely a management and cultural issue – Hawaiian’s staff were not and are not empowered to make the obvious right decision within a 2 hour period because they fear the consequences of acting without authority so much, that they very deliberately and knowingly to my face increased my inconvenience by some 10 hours. That Hawaiian Airlines considers a $400 eTicket credit to be adequate compensation for its 3 very substantial failings that resulted in such extraordinary frustration and massive inconvenience, highlights for me, and I'm sure most others, how little Hawaiian Airlines values its customers and how little it invests to seek to make amends for its staff’s very deliberate lack of care for its customers. If Hawaiian Airlines genuinely wanted to prevent a re-occurrence of this monumental screw-up, this matter would have been escalated to senior management, specifically the CEO, which is the only area of any organization where substantial management and cultural issues are able to be successfully addressed. But they didn’t; so they’ll continue to screw over many more customers.

### "rip off and no benefits"
Not Verified |  Los Angeles to Lihue. Paid for Extra Comfort. What a rip off and no benefits. No movies unless you get a app on your phone. If you want a pillow or blanket they want to charge you $10. I talked to the guy at the gate and he agreed about a ripoff ad suggested I write in. I did and never heard back from them. $320 total cost for the upgrade. Don't bother, go Delta and get movies, free pillow and blanket. Free cocktail.

### "the flight was delayed"
Not Verified |  Honolulu to Los Angeles. This is only my second time flying in this airline. First time the flight was delayed for 3.5 hours. The second time the flight was delayed for 45 minutes waiting on a crew member. They got us all on the aircraft before they let us know. Would've been nice to wait in the terminal instead of waiting in the cramped airline seats.

### "Very disappointing service"
At my travel agent's recommendation I flew Hawaiian Airlines (first trip to Hawaii) so my bags could be checked in all the way through on my return Big Island / Honololu / Sydney flight. Very disappointing service on Sydney - Honolulu flight, and almost as bad return. Grumpy cabin crew who did not seem to even want to be there, very limited meal selection, very hard to get attention or service. It was more like a 10-11 hour domestic flight than an international travel experience. Glad I bought the US$125 "premium" economy upgrade though. Inter-island Honolulu - Big Island and back were fine. I would not fly Hawaiian again and wish I'd flown Qantas.

### "getting my suitcases last"
Honolulu to Seoul. I have flown Hawaiian Airlines many times. As a Pualani Platinum member I was able to compare my experiences every flight. Customer Service wise, ground staff are average and flight staff varies (some flights were great, some very disappointing). I travel First Class most of the time. Seat comfort and space is just alright, food is average. My major complaint is the baggage service. What’s the point of having a priority tag on your suitcases being in First Class or Platinum Member if you will receive it last anyway since they will prioritize connecting passengers? This is mostly on flights landing in HNL and mainland US. Other airlines I have flown with, when I have priority tags on my suitcases and/or flying premium cabins, I get my suitcase as soon as I arrive the baggage carousel. With Hawaiian Airlines, since most passengers are connecting to different islands or somewhere else, I always end up getting my suitcases last or almost last! That is very frustrating since you disembark first and gets to the baggage carousel first and you will be left there when almost everybody have collected their baggage. I really do not see the point of them putting priority tags for First Class passengers if they are not connecting anywhere and get their bags last anyway. It happened every single time and it is just really frustrating! I mostly travel long haul and all I want is a fast way to get home after a long flight. But no, my suitcases will come after all the economy connecting passenger baggage! Sorry Hawaiian Airlines, but compare to Emirates and Korean Air that I traveled in First Class, their First Class service really feels like First Class on everything especially giving you priority on mostly everything! To me, priority means “PRIORITY”!

### "Do not get conned by this airline"
We purchased first class tickets for our 30th Anniversary trip. The flight over was what we expected, with comfortable seats, quality food, and good entertainment. The flight back, not so much! The airplane was downgraded to a smaller class, and we were given $300 vouchers at the gate for the 'inconvenience. If you are ever in this situation, do not accept anything short of a full refund. The seat was broken; wouldn't recline without standing and pushing it back manually, and the leg rest did not work at all. The good was gross - there is just no other word for it. The flight attendants were not helpful in any way at all. The voucher can only be used for 12 months, is not transferable, and is a waste of paper. Do not get conned by this airline.

### "my bag too heavy"
Kona to Honolulu. The airline staff is clearly misusing its monopoly position for travel in hawsii. I was travelling with a trolley of +/- 12 kg and allowed cabin size. When boarding a check in agent lifted my bag and said "too heavy". I asked for a weight check on a scale but she refused and literal when i say it is too heavy it is too heavy? You have two options to check it to Honolulu or Narita. Totally unacceptable customer service and clearly an employee that does not have any competence in working with customers.

### "definitely fly with them again"
Honolulu to Hilo. I flew Hawaiian on their B717 last March. I knew that the B717 was not a large aircraft and the flight was only 40 minutes long so I was not expecting much. I was pleasantly surprised by the service and seats. The flight attendants were very fast if you asked for something and they were kind. The seat was pretty comfortable and there were only two seats on my side of the isle. I will definitely fly with them again.

### "service is so poor and slow"
Phoenix to Honolulu. The service this airline provides is so poor and slow. Starting with the customer service and pricing on my flight. My husband and myself both opened a Hawaiian airline credit card to take advantage of their 50,000 air miles promotion. I got my miles but my husband didn’t and when we called the customer service number the representative couldn’t give us an explanation as to what happened to his air miles. When we were in the airport the representative took approximately an hour to help two people in front of us. The experience we have had with this airline has been so stressful and unpleasant I’m planning on cancelling my credit card and never giving this airline my business again.

### "in-flight service was also good"
Los Angeles to Kauai. My wife and I went on a vacation to Kauai by Hawaiian Airlines. The flight time to the island from Los Angeles is 5.5 hours. The overall experience was very good. On a scale of 1 to 10, I will rate it as 9. The scheduled departure time was 8:00 AM and it departed exactly at that time and arrived at Lihue Airport also on time. The aircraft was new and the cabin was quiet inside. The inside was clean. The cabin crew were very courteous and professional. The in-flight service was also good. On the way to Kauai, they gave a light breakfast and soft drinks. In addition there was also coffee. On the return flight, which departed at 2:30 PM, they gave us chicken sandwich, which we could not eat as we are vegetarians. This is the only drawback i could find and that is the reason I am giving 9 instead of 10. The arrival at LAX was on schedule.

### "I was not allowed to board"
I was not allowed to board this flight because the Hawaiian Airlines representatives at the Honolulu Airport refused to recognize my US passport, which listed my name as given name first, then family name, as matching a reservation made in the Asian way, as last name first followed by given name. If Hawaiian Air wishes to continue offering flights to Asia, it needs to educate its staff about alternatives to the way names are listed in the US. Much of the world recognizes the last name first. Further, the woman at the counter was nasty, rude. I demanded to see her supervisor, who was unaware of naming conventions. For international flights, I would not recommend this airline.

### "worst flight experience"
The first issue, the flight from Sydney to Honolulu. Couldn't go online to check-in until 24 hours before the flight, when I did login no seats available! I had been auto allocated a seat, same booking but my husband had not! At the airport the next day my husband was finally allocated a seat at the back of the plane row 47, I was seated in row 22! This was rectified just prior to boarding, not the best seats but we were seated together so this was appreciated. The return flight was a nightmare. They had automatically seated my husband & I in seats 25E & 26E, not together & stuck in the middle of the middle rows. (I have had bowel surgery so this option would have been extremely irritating to whoever sat next to me in seat F) No economy seats available so I was forced to pay an extra $125 USD each to sit in their 'economy premium seats' the only ones left 14c & 14d. Seat 14c, at the front of the section so not much legroom as there is a wall in front! 14c is on the aisle halfway in front of the door leading to the bathroom & service area with a constant flow of passengers passing & knocking me as they passed. The seat was broken & would not recline, so no sleep for me. On takeoff there was one meal selection, teriyaki chicken! The snack prior to landing was half an egg sandwich & half a ham & cheese sandwich. I'm fairly certain those sandwiches were more than one day old! Various other issues, service below par, water was not offered during the flight, well I should say the staff ran through the aisles with cups & water but they rushed past so fast most passengers missed out! To top this off I asked for a gin & tonic, they don't have gin, only scotch or vodka, I opted for a white wine instead which was terrible! So only water for me. Did I enjoy my flight, no! Did my husband enjoy his flight, no. Overall, this was the worst flight experience we have ever experienced! Incidentally, we have flown to Hawaii 12 times in the last 10 years. We have flown Hawaiian at least 4 times previously, last time in 2016, same trip and was happy with all details of our flight. Not this time!

### "delayed hours or canceled"
Honolulu to Lanai. 75% of flights I've taken or tried to take have been delayed hours or canceled all together. The worst part are the continual mechanical issues on this small aging fleet. Just several days ago the cabin filled with smoke and had to divert back to HNL. My advice, fly into OGG Kahului Maui, Uber or taxi over lo Lahaina and take the ferry. It may be more costly but you will feel safer and could very well beat the time you will lose during idle at the gate. You might even see some whales and dolphins on a side benefit.

### "Will never fly again!"
Sacramento to Honolulu. Terrible plane. Old. Bathrooms didn’t lock. Watched several people walk in on others using the bathroom. Plane was dirty. Update your planes. Played hula dancers the whole flight on the one TV in the cabin. Will never fly again!

### "never recommend this airline"
Honolulu to Portland. I originally bought my ticket for a 1:15pm flight that would have arrived at 10pm which was perfect timing for me as I needed to drive home another 2hrs so I'd arrive home around midnight. At first, it got changed to 1:30pm; no big deal, whatever. In the airport, it got delayed another 45mins; alright, okay, I can get over that. Then the departure time was changed to 6:15pm, 5hrs after the original time I purchased my ticket because the plane we were supposed to take wasn't functioning properly and we had to wait to switch planes with all new flight staff. We arrived to our destination at 3am. I did not get home until 5am. The compensation? A $20 food voucher for the airport we were stuck in that almost everyone the flight found useless as everyone was prepared fully to be on board with snacks and drinks ALREADY paid for (we had started boarding before it got delayed 5hrs) and most stores closed early so if you didn't grab the voucher and run somewhere quick, too bad for you. Then, you find out in flight, they had the gall to make you pay for a blanket! I'm sorry, if someone wanted a blanket, they should have been given one. It was a flight which turned into a red-eye and at the very least, blankets should have been given out. You had to pay for literally everything, at least give the people who were trying to sleep a blanket! Here's another issue, this 5hr delay caused my partner to need to call out of work the next day as they were my ride home. They lost a whole day's pay now. I had anxiety medications for flying and when I saw we were boarding, I assumed it was safe, so I took them and then when we were delayed, I was screwed out of my anxiety medications for the actual flight. I will never recommend this airline and will never fly with it again.

### "Flight left 4 hours late"
Maui to San Diego. Flight left 4 hours late. The food served was inedible. The aircraft when entered was like a refrigerator, when asked for a blanket, they needed a credit card to charge for it. Boarding the plane was like amateur hour. Group 1 over here, group 2 sit, group 3 over there. Nice colorful uniforms and lots of Alohas, but not much training. The plane was new and OK when it finally arrived. The flight was cheap but will definitely find a better airline next time. You can download their App and pay for movies on your phone, other than that no entertainment options. Very difficult to arrange seats if you want to sit together.

### "great friendly cabin crew"
Koa to Seattle via Honolulu. I had very low expectations as we were flying just ahead of Hurricane Lanes approach. I was expecting disorganized delays and everything was actually perfect. Our short inter island flight was the same as always and our flight to Seattle was excellent. A great friendly cabin crew gave us excellent service as we comfortably sat for five hours. Although the seats aren’t extra wide they are comfy and go fully flat. The food was quite good and the crew really excelled which lately is not a given on Hawaiian. The flights were on time. All together a wonderful experience.

### "isn’t that comfortable"
Honolulu to Sydney. Extra comfort isn’t that comfortable at all. Very limited choice of movies. The little food given was terrible. Staff did not seem very enthused in being there and nobody wanted to help in getting me to my connecting flight being I missed it due to the Hawaiian Airlines flight getting in late. Never again!

### "totally unimpressed"
Not Verified |  Kona to Honolulu. My flight was cancelled but there was no one providing any information at the airport, no one assisting customers, no announcements of any kind period. We made a flight only from sheer luck. I met a man whose flight was cancelled the night before. His luggage was not returned to him and he had two young children. They spent the night in a small motel and were scheduled for an 11AM flight that was then also cancelled. No one was helping him. I am totally unimpressed with what we call customer service at Hawaiian Airlines.

### "Don't bother with the bid up"
Honolulu to Los Angeles. Don't bother with the bid up. Did it but not worth it. Glad I ate before flight. They had 2 meals to choose from tofu and beef stew. The lie flat is great to experience but they have a long way to go with their meals. They are not a food allergy friendly airline. The ipads are great however in coach you have more options of things to watch

### "worst experience ever"
Honolulu to Maui. This was the worst experience ever. I will never fly with Hawaiian Airlines again and I think no one else should either. First off the employees are very rude. I was asking one AO some questions and he told me to go ask "questions at another gate". I was on standby all day until the last flight out and for the most part no one said anything throughout the process besides how many other people were on standby. One employee was so loud when speaking to the customers, almost as if she hated dealing with customer's but that's her job. My husband and I are employees of another airline we paid for our tickets but was told by the male employee who previously told me to go away that we were on the bottom of the list because we are employees of another airline and booked through our flight benefits. We were later told by really nice AO's something different. In the past I flew with many airlines and overall this is the worst experience Hawaiian Airlines did not even offer food vouchers to their customers. To whom every is thinking of flying with this company I suggest you think long and hard.

### "No logic!"
Not Verified |  Honolulu to Kahului . We were booked at 9:50pm and were at the gate early. We requested to take the 8:45pm flight instead and we had no checked in luggage. The 8:45pm flight wasn't full but we were denied. They said there are fees associated with the change. Really? I guess there isn't any more bending backwards for customers. No logic!

### "staff were outstanding"
Flew Las Vegas to Auckland via Honolulu June 26th 2018 and returned July 19, 2018. A wonderful experience on all sectors, the cabin staff were outstanding, and the flight deck were very informative on the conditions expected throughout the flight. Hawaiian music and videos welcomed us onboard, and set the mood for a very enjoyable flight. I usually travel Air New Zealand out of Los Angeles or San Francisco but decided to try Hawaiian as they fly out of Las Vegas. I am so glad I did and would like to thank all of the crew, both cabin and flight deck for a job well done! The only complaint is with Honolulu airport. It is certainly overdue for a complete overhaul.

### "never had such a poor experience"
I was beyond disappointed with Hawaiian Airlines. From the horrible customer service, rude flight attendants, planes that are so outdated and falling apart that nothing works on them. The terrible fees they charge. I left a carry on bag and when I tried to get a flight attendant from our flight to help me out with it I was met with a rude attitude and told I would just have to call the next day because she needed to meet her friend who was picking her up. When I asked if there was someone else she said there was no managers or staff or anyone in the entire airport that could help, I find that hard to believe considering the fact that our baggage hadn't even made it to baggage claim when I notified her that I left somthing behind. She made no effort to try to help at all and was clearly bothered by me even asking. The flight attendants on the plane weren't any friendlier either. When boarding the plane I was told my carry on wouldn't fit because this was a really old plane and the bins are small and hopefully my bags would make it cause that's reassuring. For the amount of money I spent to fly 7 people I would expect a lot more. I am doubtful I will get any help tomorrow regarding my carry on left behind. I have flown with many other airlines and never had such a poor experience.

### "only got offered $50 refund!"
Las Vegas to Kahului via Honolulu. Their customer affairs department that handles issues is only accessible via on-line submission form, and they're just going to send you the same response, no matter whether it resolves your problem or not. If you call - they will tell you there is no way to talk to consumer affairs department, and just keep sending them messages. We boarded a plane and were sitting on the plane for 1.5 hrs with no idea of why we are not taking off. Nobody was able to give us any information on what kind of “issues” are those. We had to get off the plane and only after numerous inquiries and concerns raised one of the staff told us it was an issue with pilot’s communication system. 2 hours later from the original departure time, we boarded the plane again, and took off. The plane was freezing cold and I was told I have to purchase blankets if we’re cold, and they can’t change the temperature. Other people were freezing too, and there was nothing done about it. Additionally, there were electrical issues and our monitors weren’t working for a long time. They said we will all get unlimited entertainment package for our inconvenience, but it never happened. 20 min into the flight one of the passengers had medical issue. Within minutes this man collapsed in front of our eyes and they started performing CPR on him, alternating with oxygen mask. After the plane started flying back we got an announcement that it was turned around. Back at Honolulu we were waiting for at least another hour for all of the medical procedures, and police investigation, before we could get off the plane to switch the planes. By the gate we were told to wait in line for food vouchers and new seat assignments. It was chaos to say the least as all of us were trying to get food at only one restaurant that was opened by the gate. There was not enough fast food left after first batch of people went through it, and ordering food was impossible as they said they won’t be able to make enough for everyone in time. It was past 9pm at this point, and we have been traveling since 10am. We boarded a new plane which was an older plane and it was freezing again! And we were sitting on a plane for an hour with no announcements or letting us know what’s going on. Later they were waiting on a second pilot. Why were we rushed to get on the plane with no time to eat, if the pilot was not even there? Entertainment systems were still locked, and we got offered no comfort, drinks or anything after everything we have been thru. Back home, their luggage process got screwed up with mixing bags from different flights, and nobody from the staff knew what's going on. After all of that, we only got offered $50 refund! Absolutely ridiculous! And there is no way to talk to someone, and all we get is that consumer affairs approved $50 and good luck with that.

### "poor customer service"
Las Vegas to Honolulu. Halfway through our family vacation, in Hawaii, my father passed away. When I contacted Hawaiian Airlines to change my flight they wanted $400 to do so. I was blown away by the clerks attitude we were working with, so insensitive and would not cooperate in any way. It was cheaper for me to purchase a return flight than to change my existing flight. My wife thought that she would appreciate my empty seat, she would be more comfortable on the return flight with the kids. She checked in my seat for which I could not get a refund or any consideration. A smelly beach bum tried sit in my seat. My wife told him that it was not his because we paid for it! The stewardess told my wife it was his seat because they resold my seat to him. WOW! Talk about double dipping into our pockets. I am so upset at how Hawaiian Airlines has treated my family and great lack of customer service or consideration. I can never use them again and I would not recommend them. By the way they charge for just about everything. The dinners that we had going out and coming back were horrible. A terrible value in general and poor customer service.

### "Very disappointing"
Not Verified |  Honolulu to San Diego. Very disappointing. When we arrived to airport there is no guidance from Hawaiian Airlines staff on we’re we should go or line should we go. The staff can’t control the line and throngs of customer. It doesn’t guide customer which line to go. There is also no directions on going to check point and we’re to go to gate line. Not enough staff help. Very poor communications. If I have opportunity again to come back to Hawaii, I will avoid taking to Hawaiian Airlines.

### "want  to thank all staff"
San Francisco to Kahului. I want very much to thank all staff of Hawaiian Airlines for the BEST experience on my first time flying. The courtesy, and assistance, meal, and cleanliness from check in to landing to and from. I could not express enough the joy I had and comfort.

### "Not happy with the change"
❌ Not Verified |  Kahului to Molokai via Honolulu. Not at all happy with the change in our scheduled flight. Originally we had plenty of time to pick up our luggage from another and recheck-in with Hawaiian and be taken directly to Molokai. The two airlines were booked on separate itineraries. The change moved not only the time from several hours to about 1.5 hours, but also we had to stop in HNL and change planes. I called Hawaiian Airlines customer service about what to do and got 'maybe this, maybe that', in other words, no help. Arrived at the originating airport from Mainland to The Islands early, that airline was more than helpful, even though separate itineraries, that airline was able to check our bags through to final destination

### "I was surprisingly disappointed"
Maui to Phoenix via Honolulu. When booking my families tickets I decided to pay extra to fly Hawaiian because I had heard positive reviews of the airline before but I was surprisingly disappointed. On both flights I was excited about getting a window seat but on both flights the window seat did not have a window but rather just a wall to look at. The in-flight entertainment app did not work and the flight attendants skipped past both me and my brother when handing out food. During the flight I saw that all the bathrooms near me were occupied and saw a bathroom sign that said it was unoccupied towards the front. After walking to the front bathroom a flight attendant blocked me with their arms and told me (quite rudely) that I was not allowed back there. Overall, I would not recommend Hawaiian airlines to a friend.

### "sipped our Hawaiian cocktails"
Together with my parents we flew from Honolulu to Kona in Business Class/domestic First. Taking into account that the price difference between coach and Business Class was $50, and that luggage is included, I would most likely pay the difference again. The seat was a big, comfortable chair with enough leg space. We sipped our Hawaiian cocktails and enjoyed the splendid view outside the window. A snack was served (small bag of pretzels); I think here Hawaiian has room for improvement such like fresh fruits or a snack basket like the mainland carriers use for such short flight.

### "disappointing flying experience"
Honolulu to San Francisco. Hawaiian Airlines is going downhill. The lines for bag check in and for security — for TSA Pre too— were around out of the terminal and around the block. Gee, HNL is Hawaiian Airlines’ hub; one would expect that they would have their check in act together on their home turf. Not. Almost missed my flight. The food selection in flight was incredibly limited, and Hawaiian did not even offer the option to buy a meal. Really? On a 5 hour flight? Hard to believe. The flght attendants are also starting to catch the disease normally associated with other airlines: Surly-itis. It took 45 minutes for my bag to appear in baggage claim. Altogether, a disappointing flying experience.

### "a terrible experience"
Las Vegas to Honolulu. What a terrible experience this flight was, keep the temperature in the plane at a maximum of 20 degrees Celsius just to make people ask for blankets which they sell with 10$. After take off they started to sell food without informing that in another 40min they will serve the food in the tickets -  they ask for money on earbuds and movies. After complaining they offered a 100 usd travel credit despite i told them that i am living in Europe.

### "staff has very little concern"
Sydney to Honolulu. I took a trip to Hawaii for the first time ever for my honeymoon with my husband. The island is beautiful and the people are lovely. Unfortunately the staff and customer service wasn't. We were left hungry both on the way and back as they couldn't provide a vegetarian meal even though I had checked double times both ways. no effort was made to provide substitute food and the staff has very little concern. The 9 hour flight was a struggle and we will not be flying with them again. After complaining we received 100 credit with the airline. Not sure how this helps me?

### "got good value for" money
Honolulu to Auckland. First time flying with Hawaiian Airlines and I must say we got good value for money. Air New Zealand have been fleecing New Zealanders for years on this sector for years so it's great to see competition. The cabins are very airy and simple, seat room in economy was ok and the seat was comfy enough. The cabin crew were very friendly and had a nice Hawaiian relaxed style. Communication from the flight deck was excellent re flight times, turbulence etc. Meal service was good as was bar service. Despite the cheaper ticket price, Hawaiian is a full service airline and you're luggage is on the piece system, good for bringing back you're outlet shopping! We will definitely fly Hawaiian next time we go up to Honolulu and further.

### "Terrible in cabin service"
Phoenix to Honolulu. Terrible in cabin service on the way to Hawaii and the way home. The cabin was so cold, we were offered blanket for $10 but when we went to buy one they didn't have anymore so we froze the whole 6 1/2 hr flight. The food was terrible also, so we were cold and hungry by the time we arrived. After voluntarily checking 2 of our bags when asked, due to limited baggage space due to a totally full flight. The appreciation we got for that was a totally cracked suitcase with no explanation.

### "predatory and exploitative"
New York to Honolulu. I had the gate slammed at my face after my wife and I spent close to 40 mins at the TSA line. We were roughly one minute late. We explained to the Hawaiian Airline staff at the boarding gate what happened and they reported that they could not let us board the plane due to "security reasons". The plane waited on the tarmac for 20 more mins after our experience before taking off. Within this period of trying to negotiate, 9 other people who were late came up to the gate with the same TSA complaint. We noted and reported that other airline staff tried to help get their passengers quickly through the TSA lines but Hawaiian airline staff did not. We were asked to rebook our flight, only for us to get a quote for $2200 dollars for (2) one way ticket from New York to Hawaii for my wife and I - twice the cost of my return ticket. This was predatory and exploitative. We were upset but paid it as we were attending an annual medical conference in Hawaii and had paid for extra courses as well which we did not want to miss. I should have flown United, Delta or American Airlines. My friends who did had a better experience in terms of friendliness and consideration of their ground staff and cabin staff. We spent 20 extra hours trying to reach our destination and paid dearly for the one minute delay in getting to the boarding gate. Please avoid this airline at all costs. We are in the times where airlines are trying to redeem their image. Unfortunately Hawaiian does not give a rat's behind about customers and diplomacy as long as you have paid for your tickets.

### "bad customer experience"
Honolulu to Maui. We came early to airport- there were early planes with empty seats even though the flights were empty - we requested they told -they will charge extra dollars and behaved very rude. Total very bad customer experience - will never travel in this airline

### "absolute worst customer service ever"
Can I rate it a zero! The absolute worst customer service ever. I had a total of 6 flights scheduled during my honeymoon in Hawaii. The total cost of all the "island hopping" flights is about $600 dollars. I needed to change my flight because of blizzard in the eastern U.S (NY to DC) that has 2500 flights canceled. They are a partner of United, my carrier to Hawaii and you should be able to change due to inclement weather. I needed to push each flight back one day. After waiting on hold for one hour they tell me they want to charge me about $400 to change the flights (75% of the cost). They said maybe to try having a United rep call to change the flight. I call back with a United Rep. They want to charge me $400 for the flight. Speaking with their customer service reps is a miserable experience. All offshore reps which doesn't always have to be unpleasant but I felt like I was speaking to the mafia with these folks. Every other hotel and airline I called to reschedule due to this snow blizzard were nice and had no issue changing. This airlines customer service is rotten to the core. Stay away.

### "The most horrible experience"
Los Angeles to Kauai. The flight was scheduled for 8am. They let people in the plane, we were waiting for 1 hour inside the plane (it was really cold and when i asked for the blanket they said its extra cost). Finally they let us out and said its gonna be a delay, because engine was broken and they were trying to fix. Mechanics were trying to fix it for the good 6 hours, airline was promising every hour that soon we will depart. After all they couldn't fix the engine and something else was damaged on the plane (it was really old, scary how they let such old planes to operate). After 6 hours at the airport and official note from the airline that the flights is canceled i went to Hawaiian ticket counter and they issued new tickets for me and my husband for the next day with another airline, and thanks god i checked it by the evening and found out that reservation wasn't existing. They issued the ticket wrong. The company is hard to get a hold of, i had to wait 40 minutes calling from 2 different phones at the same time. Finally the representative answered and she said that they can't refund money for the flight or to change it The result, 6 hours in the airport, 2 hours on the phone, no money back nothing. The most horrible experience of my life so far with the airline.

### "the best airline I've flown to date"
Flew San Jose to Honolulu with Hawaiian Airlines. Probably the best airline I've flown to date! From the moment I boarded the plane, I was captivated. The atmosphere spelled Hawaiian hospitality, and I felt at peace. The food could have been a bit better, but hey, can't complain about complimentary meals!

### "sub-par service"
Flew Honolulu to New York City. Hawaiian Airlines, please do not advertise the electrical outlet on your website for your extra comfort seats if they don't work properly. And when asked about why it doesn't work, to have a discourteous flight attendant make up an excuse and lie to me. Why am I paying extra for this sub-par service. Please train your staff properly. Readers, please spend your money on another airline.

### "dismissive and downright rude"
Flew Maui to Honolulu. Hawaiian Airlines is the worst airline I have flown to date. The airline staff at the airport in Maui and customer service representatives lack empathy, are dismissive and downright rude. After hours of waiting for a “delayed” flight the airport representatives became irritated and rude to all of the customers in the airport. The airline customer service representatives added to the poor customer experience with their poor attitude and lack of information or knowledge to remediate my concerns.

### "I will fly Hawaiian again"
I travelled on Hawaiian Airlines from Honolulu to Maui on 4th February 2018. It was the last flight of the night so it arrived in Maui around 22:40. It was a very short flight of about 35 minutes. We were given a Guava juice drink (see photo). A nice flight all around. I will fly Hawaiian again.

### "has been a complete mess with rude service"
My family of five was scheduled for Flight HA 11 from San Francisco to Honolulu with a departure time of 8.55am. At around 8.16am, there was an announcement regarding the flight being delayed for 7 hours with a new scheduled departure of 4.30pm. When we were all moved to a different gate, we stood in line for about 20-30 minutes when another announcement came on asking everyone with the delayed flight to take a seat and that accommodations would be made. We sat and waited for a while and around 9.40am, I noticed people who had been on the delayed flight were able to check into the another flight, 41. So I went to wait in line to ask if we could be accommodated. After getting to the counter, the employee who assisted us, said it was possible and stated she needed everyone up at the counter. I signaled to my family but as we were boarding, I realized my husband wasn’t there. I called him and he had gone out of the gate area thinking we would not be accommodated. My kids and I came back out of the tunnel area and I apologized and told the agent we would wait for the 4.30pm flight since my husband wasn’t there. At this, she became upset and yanked the tickets from my hand and all three of my kids’ hands angrily. I apologized again and she made a comment stating “This is why I asked if everyone in your party was here.” I responded that I thought we were. She then raised her voice stating that “you guys are the reason why this flight (41) is delayed”. As upset and frustrated as I already was about a 7 hour delay on our original flight, I had been patient but could not believe my ears when she accused me and my kids of causing a delay in the flight when 1) there were still individuals going into the tunnel at the time we stepped out and 2) after our original flight was delayed for 7.5 hrs and we were told to sit down and they would take care of accommodations. I can understand there can be flight delays but it does not justify the workers being hostile. I did respond that it (causing the delay on 41 even though that wasn’t the case because she was still checking in someone else) wouldn’t have happened if the original flight wasn’t delayed. Also, at this time, there were still other customers who were going into the tunnel area. This is my family’s first time flying with Hawaiian Airlines and it has been a complete mess with rude service. When there are flights delayed for 7.5 hours, I would think that the airline would better train their employees to understand the frustration of its customers instead of blaming them for causing another delayed flight or yanking tickets out of kids’ hands when there are additional people boarding after.

### "we have been delayed for 2 hours"
Due to fly Hawaiian Airlines from New York JFK to Honolulu. The staff are not nice, we have been delayed for 2 hours and they keep anouncing that we will delayed for 15 minutes. They never update us as to what is happening and we are just standing looking stupid waiting to find out what will happen next. Cabin crew just keep running around getting their breakfast.

### "a very bad experience"
San Diego to Brisbane via Honolulu. Was a very bad experience. Honolulu has a very old airport that cannot handle the traffic causing numerous delays and problems getting to the gate and going through security. It took 2.5 hours to check in! One of the worst airports in the US. We were stuck on the taxiway for 45 minutes after landing in HNL due to no gate available. The food was awful and they do not offer options based on dietary needs or a second choice for food. They do not give frequent flyer points or status credits if you booked a sale fare. That was an unpleasant surprise. Plus the planes are very old and cramped. Far less leg room than other airlines.

### "Travel with caution"
Honolulu to Sacramento. Travel with extra time on your hands. Three out of four flights coming home from HNL have had delays. Lost something to do with the motor one the first flight. This flight was from Maui to San Jose, California. We were forced us to turn around about an hour out from Hawaii and land at HNL. That caused everyone to spend several hours in a very separated airport terminal. Away from any real food. But we were given snacks and waters! Second flight went fine. Our third flight was delayed over seven hours at the airport. We arrived at 5 am when we should have arrived at 10 pm the night prior. Hawaiian never compensated us for the delay. They have continued to lose our paperwork, strange. Our last flight (fourth), was delayed two hours due to a malfunctioning piece of equipment. Which they fixed and got us underway. I learned the after the first run-in with the Hawaiian staff. You won't win at the airport. They can be rude and dishonest with the best of them. A small riot almost broke out in the airport due to all the passengers be kept in the dark over the "status of repairs". They had pieces of the plane that were the size of a small car laying on the ground with zero maintenance staff anywhere. They even went so far as to bring a standby pilot to sit in the cockpit and act like something was going to happen. Hours went by with no repairs and no answers. That's when it got out of hand, passengers yelling at the staff for answers. They finally were forced to put everyone in a hotel for the night. The next morning we reboarded the repaired plane and another mechanical issue forced us back to the gate. Several people just got up and left the flight. After all that, they still managed to lose our luggage. Still never received compensation for the damaged bag either. They keep losing that paperwork as well. Travel with caution.

### "decline in quality and service"
Portland to Honolulu. I used to love traveling back home to Oahu on Hawaiian Airlines. Key words: "used to". I am not sure when their decline in quality and service happened but it's a real bummer. I had my trip back home planned for over six months. My boyfriend decided to tag along and bought his ticket a month before. Not knowing Hawaiian declined, I boasted how great of an airline it is. I wanted his first trip to Hawaii to start off great and felt confident he'd have a great ride. We arrived to HNL within 15 mins of each other. This was the first time I rode home on United and it was great! I ran over to the Hawaiian terminal with a fresh lei in hand so I could give my bf a proper Hawaiian greeting as he walked out. After giving him his lei I asked how his flight was. terrible, this was the WORST airline I ever rode on! They had no entertainment on the flight, no complimentary meal and everyone was terribly rude! I didn't believe him and joked that maybe he got on the wrong plane. On the way back home after a great week on Oahu, his flight was delayed and then delayed again for another two hours after they boarded. I thought for sure his flight was a fluke with Hawaiian. Well, here I am today. Christmas Day 2017. My father called last night to let me know my grandma would be passing. Hawaiian Airlines was the only airline with a seat on the earliest flight out so I booked it knowing I'd be in comfort. Lo and behold, the flight was a half hour delayed because their caterers had trouble getting the food on board. Then they finally board us! Nope. I am sitting here almost two hours later, as they decided to fuel up and de-ice after boarding passengers. Why would any airline make its customers wait on board in cramped chairs when we already have a long flight ahead? So, I decided to bide my time by watching some entertainment. No! I guess my bf wasn't lying all along, there is none! Bad on their part, now my only source of entertainment is to write this (what should be 0) one star review. In addition to their decline in quality, a single bag check used to be free. Now $25. Haven't had my in-flight meal yet but I'm wondering if I'll have to pay premo-prices for the food the caterers probably dropped all over the place when they had a hard time loading it up and delaying the flight. As I'm typing this they just announced another hour delay. Here's to three hours wasted! Let's hope Hawaiian Airline's delays don't make me late from seeing my grandma one last time! Time to sign off. The lady behind me is starting to panic from feeling claustrophobic.

### "don’t use this airline"
Honolulu to Las Vegas. First they changed our flight to leave earlier, with a layover in Honolulu for four hours. And to make it even better they lost our luggage. And they also cannot scan the barcode for our luggage because Hawaiian airlines does not offer that. However they give you a barcode for your luggage when you check your bag, but it doesn’t work. Whatever you do don’t use this airline. The team on the flight make you feel like they don’t even want to assist you. Worst experience ever! It’s 1am in the morning and I am trying to make a claim to find my bag.

### "Very slow and unfriendly service"
Flew Hawaii to Los Angeles. Very slow and unfriendly service from Hawaiian Airlines. They treat customers like products, not people. Service agent at the departing gate did not show up until less than one hour before plane departure. Because Hawaii airport is overflowing with tourists / passengers, the airline doesn’t care how much they annoy people because there will always be demand. Fly with caution.

### "crew aggressive and indifferent"
Honolulu to Sydney. Flight from SYD-HNL was reasonable only because they had a great crew who were young, happy and willing to help, the return flight though was the complete opposite, old crew who were aggressive and indifferent to passengers, a real contrast a perhaps Hawaiian need to look at removing staff like these to improve customer experience. Seats were very cramped with very little leg room and the meals were both very small and tasteless (rice was solid like a rock), Hawaiian need to understand they have not only Qantas and Jetstar running this route but Air NZ and Fiji Airways so they can't rely on their name when their product is so poor.

### "refuse to accept this type of rude behaviour"
My wife and I have just returned from a US holiday flying from Honolulu to Sydney. During the flight I had to go to the toilet. The toliet was occupied so I attempted to go to the other side of the plane. The male flight attendant was in the galley so rather than disturb him I waited for the toilet to vacate. He then told me rudely to stop "mulling" around that area, so I started to go back to my seat, but then he said the other one was vacant. After using the other toilet I had no way of getting back to the other side of plane so I attempted to go back through the galley but then he critisied me again for going through that area and spoke "rudely" to me (in front of other passengers). I absolutely refuse to accept this type of rude behaviour, to a paying passenger from a flight attendant. The female attendants were not rude but this male attendant needs to have a close look at himself and this behaviour towards passengers. We will never fly Hawaiian Airlines again.

### "Hawaiian was fantastic"
Hilo to Honolulu. Hawaiian was fantastic! We made a mistake in our booking and didn't realize that we had scheduled our return flight from the big island out of the wrong airport with united airlines. While united wanted to charge us $4000 to get us home, Hawaiian worked very hard to find a different route home for us even though we hadn't been using their airline!! They even checked our bags all the way to Toronto for free because they wanted to help! I have never had any airline treat me so well! It's just a shame that we can't fly Hawaiian for all of our flights! We are so pleased. Their ticketing agents were amazingly helpful!

### "airline staff were very curt with us"
Flew Kauai to Los Angeles. I wish I could say Hawaiian was any different from any US-based airline. Customer service is pretty mediocre, bordering on rude at times. Our flight did not include individual TV screens, only shared TV screens that showed things like a Hawaii city council meeting and public access type television programming. The food was inedible - lukewarm breakfast sandwiches with fruit that tasted old. The airline staff were very curt with us. At one point we asked about early boarding because we had a child with us, and the desk agent snapped that it wasn't our turn yet. Okay, that's why we were asking. We had to check in our stroller at the gate and when we arrived at Lihue, it took us 20 minutes to find an airline staff who could tell us where the stroller was. We were told they'd bring it to us, then it turned out to be behind the desk. We flew Hawaiian because we figured it would be better than United, but it's really the same level of bad service just disguised with a lei.

### "not check in due to being late"
Kona to Honolulu. I was told I could not check in due to being late. I was not aware of this policy and never before when I flew with Hawaiian Airlines was I denied my ticket to fly. There is no policy about checking in on time on your itinerary so the only way you can find out about this bad news is if you get it first from the desk. I was then printed a ticket for a flight an hour after my original flight, and when everything was done, I went off to TSA line and got to my original gate in 2 mins. I arrived at the gate 20 mins before boarding even began and I was denied entry on board by the Hawaiian employees. They were not being friendly at all and wanted to just go on their "lunch break" at 6:28pm. Very unprofessional of these people. I was also belittled by one of them when claiming that is my plane that I should be on and they were asking me in a very condescending way if I want my ticket back as I gave it to one of the ladies for confirmation. I was and am still disgusted with Hawaiian Airlines and their customer service. I feel cheated that I had to still pay them for the pet cabin too because I had my pet in her kennel all the time waiting eagerly to get home. They email me later asking how my flight was and on the bottom it had their checking in Policy with different information then what I was told by all the employees.

### "Old, uncomfortable and small planes"
Flew Hawaiian Airlines from Maui to Honolulu. Old, uncomfortable and small planes. Unhelpful check in crew. The night before my flight I got an email saying that there would be a delay on my flight and I would miss my conection to LAX. After making calls and rechecking the situation, apparently the email was a mistake, there was nothing wrong with the flight. After being mistreated at check in where the attendant didn't help to arrange the seats for me and my husband to sit next to each other, the airplane, very old by the way, had a technical problem causing departure delay. Not satisfied with the service provided by this company.

### "Crew were friendly and efficient enough"
On time flight Honolulu-Sydney with Hawaiian Airlines. Crew were friendly and efficient enough. Beverage supply was very good as were the meals albeit of the smaller size. Aircraft was in good condition and appeared to be of the newer A330 kind, however, the fact that the screen is fixed to the seat back in front makes for difficult viewing if the person in front reclines.

### "Hawaiian left me with a good impression"
Flew Hilo to Lihue via Honolulu. This trip was two very short flights, less than an hour in the air total, but Hawaiian left me with a good impression. The seats and plane interiors are nothing special, but for flights this short it doesn't matter - I've flown long haul with them and on those flights they're great. On this trip, despite checking in all the way to Lihue, for some reason my bag was only checked to Honolulu. I wasn't told this when checking in, so I arrived at Lihue to find my bag hadn't come with me. This was annoying, but the way Hawaiian handled it couldn't have been better. I was on the last flight for the night, but when I rang at 8am the next morning, my bag had already arrived. Then, a couple of days later, I noticed the fee I had paid for checked luggage refunded to my bank account, without me even asking. Every company makes mistakes sometimes, but if they all handled them like Hawaiian did, the world would be a much nicer place.

### "there's hardly any leg room"
Overall average airline experience flying from Sydney to Honolulu. Check in: automated counters weren't working, so everyone had to be manually checked in, took around 30 mins of waiting. Service staff at the counter couldn't even manage a smile. But was a smooth process despite the minor flaws. Boarding: boarded in zones, worked well, was slightly delayed due to the incoming flight being slightly delayed. Staff kept everyone well informed. Couldn't ask for more. Inflight: air crew were very casually dressed, fitted with the Hawaiian vibe. Weren't as tight and efficient as Thai airways or Etihad. Still the staff were friendly and seemed like they cared about passengers having a good experience. There was no power port on the plane, only USB charging for low power devices. The seats were uncomfortable with very thin cushions, the seats recline quite a bit but there's hardly any leg room. I'm not a tall person but my knees were mashed into the seat in front most of the flight. They provided a pillow and a blanket as well as headphones and earplugs which are necessary as this aircraft was very loud. Meals: dinner was a casserole/curry with rice and beans which was pretty good. There was some coon cheese, and a dairy milk. Staff offered a large range of beverages. Breakfast was a bit dissappointing as there was no hot meal, I got a yoghrt, a bread piece with jam and butter and a cinnamon muffin. Overall was acceptable for the price

### "strength is in their hospitality"
San Francisco to Maui with Hawaiian Airlines. Happy to see a big improvement in the front cabin after a few years of decline. The newly designed cabin is randomly available on domestic routes, always available on certain routes and will be a standard in the next year. Although it seems like they spent as little as they could. Entertainment is via a large iPad attached to a pole that pulls out like a tray table. Odd but it's fine. The meal was quite good for domestic first class as well. The strength, when it is there is their bright light that can shine from Hawaiian people. Both attendants today were in the most Hawaiian way, gracious warm and great at their job. I hope it's a trend. Seats and entertainment matter but Hawaiians strength is in their hospitality. When it works, it's world class. When it's off you notice the less then great cabin. One more thing and it's big. No Wi-Fi and no plans. Big mistake, bad calculation on their part.

### "pay $80 more to sit together"
Maui to Seattle. Bought tickets 5 months for me and my wife. While checking in 24 hrs in advance I get a seat assigned and my wife does not. They were under airport control. Reached gate 90 mins before departure and we were asked to either take last row or pay $80 more per ticket to be able to sit together. Seriously? 15 years of flying and this is the first time. Airline food overall is average but Hawaiian airlines has below average food. It will ruin your Hawaiian experience - also they don't allow you to use wireless headphones, so you are forced to buy their earphones.

### "it is the worst airline"
Honolulu to Sydney. For me it is the worst airline. I had trouble to use the self service check in machine in the Honolulu. The customer service officer yelled out useless instructions as I am a kid making a mistake in the classroom. She was not even bothered to walk 5 steps down to have a look. When I eventually got the instruction to go to the counter for check in. I asked to keep the original seats but the guy said no seat left and give me two seats in the middle "D" in row 36 and 38" regardless my mother is 80 non English speaking and I need going to bathroom as the health issue. And later I rang the head office the reply was classic " I am sorry for your experience this time and hope you fly with us again" the no matter what you said it was a long silent. After this do you think I will fly with this junk again?

### "poorly run, unreliable, unresponsive"
Honolulu to Sacramento. This packed flight left more than two hours late because of a mechanical problem, arriving in Sacramento after midnight rather than 9:55 pm. We eventually were told, after takeoff, that the delay had something to do with the brakes. But we were kept in the dark until then. In the air, finally, we were told by way of apology that adults could have white or red wine without charge. But when I asked for white wine I was poured maybe two ounces - considerably less than half of one of those small plastic cups. We were also told that, also by way of apology, that after (so-called) dinner the movie Moana would be shown to the entire plane on the public screens and via loudspeakers. This two-hour kids' movie was thusly imposed on everyone who didn't have a noise-canceling headset. I've flown this route on Hawaiian a number of times because Hawaiian is the only carrier that does it nonstop. I've come to detest Hawaiian as a result. It is poorly run, unreliable, unresponsive, expensive, penny-pinching, and self-regarding. Stay away if you can.

### "She went above and beyond"
I recently flew from Oakland to Honolulu and had the best flying experience ever! I give 100% credit to an amazing Flight Attendant. When we first got seated, there was a gentlemen who had taken a seat that was reserved for another customer. The gentlemen wanted to sit closer to his family who was in the middle isle but the customer who purchased a seat on the isle did so because she was breast feeding and had to pump during the flight and wanted easy access to and from the bathroom. The gentlemen sat in her seat and rudely wouldn't move. The FA noticed what had happened and did an amazing job resolving the situation for the customer who rightfully purchased her seat for accessibility. She did so in a very professional manner. Later in the flight the same FA asked if my wife and I had been to Hawaii before and we shared that this was our first trip. We explained that we had been trying to go for 18 years. We asked her for local recommendations and she later came back with a personal list that she created which today we spent the day visiting many of the destinations she recommended and candidly made our trip the best trip ever. As a Director of Sales for a large organization, I am constantly working with my staff to focus on the customer and deliver awesome customer experiences. Today, this FA made my wife and I huge promoters of Hawaiian Airlines. She went above and beyond to serve customers and did an awesome job doing so!

### "experience ruined"
Will not fly with Hawaiian Airlines again. Booked day flight specifically for views between Kauai and Maui, they changed us from a window seat to the last row even though we booked and confirmed a month ago. This is the flight I was most looking forward to in the islands, experience ruined. Took forever to board, had to wait for another Hawaiian air flight to depart for 30 min on tarmac despite arriving on time. You have other options nowadays, take them.

### "I would definitely fly them again"
This was my first time flying with Hawaiian Airlines so I was very excited. It was a short, inter-island flight from Honolulu to Kahului. We departed on time and were in the air for only about 15 minutes. This meant that their was no in-flight entertainment but that was expected and it didn't pose any kind of problem because the view outside the window was enough entertainment for me! The flight was most enjoyable. The cabin crew was very kind and friendly. They passed out water or juice but also took requests from passengers if they wanted a different beverage. They also handed out a travel guide of Maui with a map and a list of activities to do. I had never experienced this on another airline so this was very touching. Landing was very smooth despite the wind and turbulence. I was very impressed! This was very good experience and if I ever return to Hawaii I would definitely fly them again!

### "We'll never fly them again"
Los Angeles to Honolulu. Terrible customer service. I accidentally booked my wife's ticket under her maiden name. They wouldn't let us change the name on the ticket. They forced us to purchase a new ticket and cancel the old one, the price difference was $750 (they will let you change a single letter for $200). What a scam. She almost missed her flight (her daughter was already on the flight). Basically they robbed us. Awful people, awful airline. We'll never fly them again.

### "kind service attitude"
Flew on Hawaiian Airlines flight HA897 from Honolulu to Beijing. I was very touched by the ground staff service. I am Chinese national (currently studying in Singapore) and my passport was stolen in Hilo. It was urgent to get back to China, get my new passport done before returning to Singapore, in order not to miss so lessons. However, there is no Chinese embassy in Hawaii. HA understood my special case scenario and allowed me to fly back to China without the original passport. In the airport, the HA ground staff as well as HNL airport ground staff were very kind and found a way to help. They took the initiative to contact the immigration checkpoint in both USA and China, they tried their best to let me board the aircraft. I was anxious about it and they consoled me and told me I would be fine. I managed to get back to China safe and sound. I'm was very impressed by the kind service attitude, otherwise, I would have to opt for a more troublesome way which is to fly 5 hours to LAX and visit the embassy there.

### "not an enjoyable experience"
Flew on Hawaiian Airlines flight HA137 from Kona to Honolulu. This airline uses the old B717 for all inter-island flights. Only water is served and the crews were very cold towards passengers. The announcement was unclear on this old aircraft. It's not an enjoyable experience but I would not say I don't recommend HA for this route, because the only airlines operate this route are HA and Island Air which are around the same standard.

### "I recommend Hawaiian Airlines"
Inter island flight from Honolulu to Hilo. This rather short flight is operated by a 20-year-old Boeing 717. The aircraft was old and there were no personal IFEs, but the seats were more comfortable than what I imagined. Only drinks were served on this short flight. But overall the experience was not bad, the check in, boarding process was smooth and the cabin crews were very helpful. HA offers 14 flights a day on this route. I recommend Hawaiian Airlines, especially to day trippers. As you can book a package tour, which gives you a one day return ticket from Honolulu and you can tour the volcano national park in Hilo.

### "staff were constantly stubborn"
Honolulu to Auckland. My flight with Hawaiian Airlines was first of all delayed 2 hours, soon to be followed by constant 30 minute extra waits with no explanation given or this. After a final 2 hours waiting to hop on the plane (a total of 5 hours after the official departure time) we were told that a piece of motor was missing and the next available flight is in another 3 days. No information was given as to refunds or transfers, food vouchers or accommodation for people who are simply tourists in the country and have no money. Nothing at all, beyond this the staff were constantly stubborn and had no answers to any questions.

### "economy food of child-size portion"
Loa Angeles to Sydney return via Honolulu. Efficient check-in and boarding. On-time departures and arrivals. Generally clean cabin and okay bathroom condition. Forced viewing of commercials Economy class food of child-size portion and poor quality; no choice for entrée; no tomato juice; breakfast verges on inedible. Long gap between dinner and breakfast on a 10-hour flight. Frequent announcements to promote transactions (snacks; credit card; duty-free, etc.). Very limited viewing selections which are exactly the same on every one of the four flights that I took. Aisle seats on the two sides have reduced leg rooms due to a power strip that runs under those seats.

### "no lounge access at LAX"
Los Angeles to Honolulu. Dismal service and even in first class have to wait to 1 hour check in (only allowed 4 hours before the flight). There is no lounge access at LAX. Hawaiian Airlines need to learn how you do business and first class! What a joke. Ground staff are pretty miserable too.

### "good functional airline"
Honolulu to Sydney. Good functional airline to take you from point A to point B. Service was adequate but not to the same standards as Singapore Airlines, Emirates or Qantas. The food provided was minimal with just a chicken/rice dish option and a sandwich just prior to landing. Check-in was functional.

### "ground staff more and more unfriendly
Kona to Kahului. I fly Hawaiian Airlines pretty often, the ground staff are getting more and more unfriendly. They fly the oldest planes in the industy. A good example what a lack of competition on some routes does to the overall motivation to provide a good service. I feel bad for those of the crew who try to provide a good service.

### "not a very pleasant journey"
Not a very pleasant journey with Hawaiian Airlines from New York to Honolulu. My 10 hour trip was very boring, since almost all entertainment (movies, tv shows, music) was provided only when extra money was paid (3.99$ or 7.99$ for movies). There was one very small meal at the beginning of the flight and an even smaller snack at the end of the flight. You had to pay extra for all alcoholic beverages (8$) and I even had to refill water myself numerous times, since flight attendands were mostly hanging out in the service area. The plane was comfortable enough and clean, but it was rather cold inside with no wifi.

### "a budget airline at best"
Flew Brisbane to Honolulu and return with Hawaiian Airlines. Flight out was very uncomfortable. When the person in front of you puts their seat back all the way it's very claustrophobic. This happened to me 5 mins after take off and I had to endure it for the whole flight. Seats too close together for long haul. We got a sandwich shortly after take off which was barely edible. Breakfast was scrambled egg potato cake and a rasher of bacon with tomato. I ate as I was so hungry but it wasn't good. The aircraft was 4 years old and was clean. The screens for the TVs are old. Singapore where using these screens 15 years ago. All in all not a very enjoyable flight. Return journey was even worse. Had to go back to concourse after taxiing out due to malfunction in air conditioning unit. Left to sit in aircraft for 1.5 hours and not even offered a drink of water. Aircraft was much older this time and very dirty. I could scrape black dirt off from around the TV screens. Crew looked a little scruffy I have to say but friendly enough. Food was pork with rice then a sandwich later in the flight. All in all was expecting much more from this airline. I would say this was a budget airline at best but then I think I would be doing a disservice to budget airlines.

### "meals were really nice"
Sydney to Honolulu with Hawaiian Airlines. Flight HA451 seat 29J on a 1 year old Airbus A330-200 aircraft. Being an international flight your ticket price includes baggage, pre seat assignment, meals dinner and breakfast, drinks, entertainment, blanket, pillow and amenity kit with head phones. The seats have the usual economy class legroom and width which was okay for the 10 hour flight. The entertainment screens in the back of the seat were a nice size on the newer aircraft. Main streams movie choice is limited and somewhat dated but you can find easily find something to watch. Cabin service was friendly and efficient. There are 9 cabin crew on the aircraft which is less than Qantas so you do notice a slower response time to requests as the crew are busy. Meals were really nice, no choice but that was fine and really tasty. The tray was full with a salad, cheese and crackers and chocolate. Pictures below are of dinner and breakfast box. Drinks and then dinner service was right after takeoff while breakfast was 1.5 hours prior to landing. Maybe a little bit too long considering when dinner was served. Snacks can be purchased between meals. Overall a good flight and airline.

### "had a very pleasant experience"
Our check-in process with Hawaiian Airlines was very easy. Had no trouble. We had decided to fly into Los Angeles to catch our first flight experience on Hawaiian. I've had awful experiences on American, Delta, and former US Airways. All were awful and had heard about the incredible flights with Hawaiian. Our needs were met and we were comfortable waiting for our 1.00pm departure to Maui. The flight was quite smooth. Quiet and comfortable. Our inflight meal was excellent. We were not expecting a meal service due to our previous experience with other US carriers. The crew and pilots were attentive and courteous. We had a very pleasant experience and vowed to never fly anyone else out to the islands. Hawaiian will have our business from this point onward. We only wish they flew in Texas where we can hop and enjoy a longer ride with Hawaiian.

### "worst airline with worst service"
The worst airline with the worst service I've encountered. We flew Sydney - Honolulu and paid extra for 'comfort class' seating to quickly realise none of the entertainment units worked so we ha to move. Waste of $$. Yesterday we set off to Sydney from Honolulu and 4 hours into the flight the captain tells us we are leaking fuel and we had to return to Honolulu. 8 hours later and back to Honolulu. Disembark and wait another hour for buses to arrive to pick us up, arrive at hotel and told they'll only pay for one nights accomodation - even though we can't get a flight for another 4 days. Given conflicting information by call centre and hung up on. Waste of time, money and ruined our holiday.

### "generally poor service"
Flew Hawaiian Airlines from Lihue to Honolulu. Generally poor service. Check-in at airport is unlike any other - a process so confusing and with so many restrictions that it would be comical were it not so stressful. Boarding process is a cattle call. Flight attendants are very nice and helpful, but the seating, refreshments, etc. are poor.

### "seat was comfortable"
Flight from Honolulu to Los Angeles with Hawaiian Airlines. Departure with some delay, but the plane was very clean and the seat was comfortable. Cabin crew always available and nice. Food was average. Only problem was the Inflight entertainment which was only available if you paid for it.

### "major let down was the food"
Honolulu to Sydney and return Brisbane to Honolulu on Hawaiian Airlines. Both flights were on time. The cabin crew was somewhat friendly, seats were comfortable and the entertainment was good (AVOD with dozens of movies). The major let down was the food. The main meal on the HNL-SYD flight, served shortly after take-off and the only option (no choices), consisted of some overly sweet chicken dish and was barely edible. At the end of the flight to SYD we were served 2 sandwiches which tasted ok, certainly better than the first meal. On the overnight return segment BNE-HNL we only got a pack of mystery meat sandwiches which were truly disgusting plus some ok single-choice breakfast before landing. Additional snacks were available on the flights but had to be purchased. Hawaiian Airlines could be a great airline if they just got the food right. I flew on a really cheap ticket so I can't really complain but if I had to pay the regular price I'd rather fly another airline with similar prices.

### "very disappointed with the upgrade"
The upgrade was $75.00 each way to Hawaii with my 79 year old mother for a funeral. Flew from Los Angeles to Honolulu. On the way to Hawaii my mother had to sit on the pillows because the seat was old and had no cushion left in it. We had no water or juice when we boarded. We had plenty of leg space because we were at the front of the upgraded seats in row 11, but the seat was not wider and did not have any extra arm space and did not lay back any further than a regular seat. The food was the same as the regular cabin, it was not upgraded. On the night flight we were given noodles with a red sauce, spinach, mushroom slices and cheese, nothing you would want to eat again. A small salad, and a cookie that was about 2"s long in the shape of a pineapple. On the same plastic tray as economy seats. On the morning flight on the way home was a cheese and egg sandwich that was inedible with some fruit and a chocolate covered macadamia nut. The latest movies you had to pay $7.99 each for, they are free on other upgraded flights with other airlines. I was very disappointed with the upgrade, they should be ashamed to have offered this service.

### "we were less than impressed"
My partner and I decided to fly what Hawaiian Airlines call First Class for a 12 day vacation in Honolulu. Last year we traveled extensively around the world in Business Class with Korean Air and Qantas. Flat beds were the norm, with amazing service, plentiful quality meals and hot snacks, a wide variety of wines and a large entertainment library on both airlines. The only positive with Hawaiian Airlines was the fact that we were able to access the Qantas Business Lounge prior to departure out of Sydney as Qantas is the handling agent for Hawaiian. The Qantas Business Lounge is superb. Now back to Hawaiian Airlines, when we boarded, (seats 1A and 1B), we were less than impressed from the start. The seats were antiquated, with very little space between rows and with no electronic function. There was no locker for our jackets and upon seating we were handed a menu and asked immediately what our selection would be for dinner, not much time to peruse the menu but the selections seemed appetising. When the meals were delivered, on a tray, similar to most airlines economy class they were disappointing, small portions and the hot component on both different choices coming out lukewarm. We were offered red or white wines with no explanation of variety or country of origin. The snacks offered during the flight consisted of a small bag of crisps and a cookie. When I asked for a small bottle of water, I was asked by the Flight Attendant didn't I get one earlier in the flight, when I replied yes but I would like another they reluctantly gave me one. During the flight we discovered that the seats would only recliner a small amount, making the 10 hour journey most uncomfortable. We still encroached the space of the passengers behind us despite the limited pitch. My seat squeaked, and my partners leg rest would not function. Having spent a considerable amount of money, ($7500), on two return tickets we feel totally ripped off. Hawaiian Airlines First/Business Class is similar to most international carriers Economy Class. Do not waste your money on such an inferior product.

### "excellent, friendly service"
A long flight from New York JFK to Honolulu made less tedious by excellent, friendly service. Regular cabin offers of water, very important on such a long flight and with a smile. The "extra comfort" seat is not really premium economy, but offers extra legroom; that and power is really the only benefit. Three criticisms:  Hawaiian makes much of the fact that it's the only US airline still offering comp food, true, but not great quality. The seat-belt sign was turned on at the slightest bump, then left on way, way after any turbulence was way behind us. Cockpit crew need reminding to turn off the sign. Excellent selection of classics and new movies, TV etc on the IFE, but touch screen not responsive (no other controller) and in-flight earphones a rip-off. Hawaiian should make it clearer that pax should bring their own.

### "dismayed by the poor service"
Honolulu to Kona. Check-in lines out the door, delayed baggage twice during our 3 days break and they won't take responsibility when they have done the wrong thing! We were recently dismayed by the poor service of Hawaiian Airlines during inter-island flights which we had booked as first class passengers. On the first from Honolulu to Kona we arrived from a flight from Australia and proceeded directly to the domestic flights area, queuing in the astonishing line for first class more than 20mins before it closed. I've never experienced a premium class service that had a queue as long with just two staff. When we arrived at the front of the queue there was still 10mins before closing time but one of the women serving walked away and a man came to take over and had to log in etc. This process took all the time remaining and not once did he look up and ask when our flight was. I regret not being more assertive at that point as the service was dismal. We then took our bags to the bag area and proceeded directly to the gate where we were told we shouldn't have been checked in and that our seats had been given away so we were now to be separated in economy seats. Not the end of the world, but laughable given the massive premium we had paid for first class tickets and not ideal given one of our companions was heavily pregnant and wanted to stay close to her husband. When we arrived on Kona we waited nearly 30minutes at the baggage carousel and after not seeing our bags, we enquired at the desk. Again we were told that because we were late (we were not, Hawaiian Airlines have a staff drought and inefficient processes) our bags weren't carried on the flight and so were arrived in Kona after 24 hours of travel with no clothes for another 3 hours! On the return flight we found the same lack of efficiency and even though we arrived more than an hour before the return flight from Kona to Honolulu, both My husband and I had our bags not arrive until the next flight. We had to wait in the airport again until the next flight arrived. Thank goodness we didn't have to get straight on another flight. We were not the only ones. It appears this is the Hawaiian Airlines way of doing business and it is 1 star. Even if you have paid for 5 star! And they say the best they can do is refund $70 of the ticket price.

### "they are pretty clueless"
Flew Hawaiian Airlines from Hilo - Honolulu return, to pick up another flight. We have no choice when it comes to leaving this Island than to fly HA. Over the years, I have seen an improvement in ground handling and paying for Premier Club does mean Hilo airport is a little more acceptable: the flight to HNL is fast and straightforward. Returning is where Old Style HA comes into it's own. Returning from Japan, there is a need to recheck baggage and get boarding passes. It appears that is too much effort for ground staff. Yes, clicking to print a pass, instead they want you to go to another desk and when you do finally board, old style FAs are so full of having a job they do not care a bit about "Customers". In short inter Island, the minimal, begrudged service can be coped with for such short flights (and no other real choice) but I will never use them to fly further afield, they are pretty clueless.

### "limited inflight entertainment"
Economy from Papeete to Honolulu with Hawaiian Airlines. Not impressed with Hawaiian's service on this medium-haul, international red-eye flight. Limited inflight entertainment was available for purchase. Dinner consisted of a small sandwich and a cookie. There was no meal choice, so those with dietary restrictions were out of luck (myself included). I was also surprised that no breakfast was offered prior to landing in Honolulu. Of course, there were also no amenity kits. Flight attendants were approachable, but they were definitely not polished professionals.

### "food was pathetic"
New York JFK to Honolulu with Hawaiian Airlines, who are slightly above average for an American carrier, but far from a five star carrier. All flights on-time, staff were approachable, and the planes were clean. Unfortunately, there were no free films or games available on the long-haul flight. The airline boasts about being the only US carrier to offer free meals on domestic flights, but the food was pathetic. I've had better food on short-haul flight within Asia. There's also no meal choice, so you're out of luck if you can't eat what they offer.

### "terrible 767 aircraft"
I flew this terrible 767 aircraft from San Jose to Honolulu. As I live in Hawaii I have no choice but to fly with Hawaiian Airlines. My whole family is Pualani gold. We only fly hawaiian Airlines and United. This is one of our first time flying the old 767 since the fleet got pretty much replaced by the A330. It was acceptable. The cabin was old and the food was not that great. but Hawaiian struggles in their early morning meals. The iPads have never had recent covers either. And we werent able to use our membership to buy the iPads either.

### "not a memorable service"
Auckland to New York via Honolulu with Hawaiian Airlines and there were no delays, and airport staff were pleasant. The standard of food was not as good as other airlines and there was no choice. Was advised the journey was full service and had expected the 11 hour flight from Hawaii to New York would come with entertainment included. It did not. You have to pay for movies and earphones, by credit card (no cash). Baggage handlers managed to damage 2 bags from our party of 3 and were not interested when this was reported. Cabin was clean, movies even though advertised as latest releases were dated. I feel this is important on long haul flights. Cabin crew were ok, and frequently offered water but it was not a memorable service.

### "mileage program is awful"
Kauai to JFK via Honolulu. We are a family of 4 and took advantage of the Hawaiian credit card/mileage offer and God forbid we chose to use the miles we earned! Stay away from this offer it is the most expensive in terms of mileage usage. It is the most inflexible if you should need to make even the slightest change. If you are a mileage customer the staff treat you like a criminal. I could go on. It is too bad the equipment and onboard crew are good, while the front office policies are archaic, the web site is very clunky not easy to use and if you make the mistake of trying to speak to someone over the phone you will age as you wait - and when you do reach an agent it is frustrating. In short find another mileage program this one is awful and is an unfortunate detractor to a wonderful Hawaii experience.

### "was very disappointed"
Honolulu to Sydney with Hawaiian Airlines, and I would not recommend, and will not be flying Hawaiian again. The plane is not very comfortable and the check in staff are not very helpful. They did not offer any kind of assistance for travelling with kids. It made for a very unplesent flight especially when travelling with children like we were. I was very dissapointed, Jetstar provides better service!

### "went above and beyond"
After a 5 week vacation in Australia my wife and I returned to Alaska via Hawaiian Airlines flight from Brisbane to Honolulu. Several days earlier she suffered severe sunburn on her feet, and as we were checking in the Hawaiian Airlines staff offered her a wheelchair and allowed us to board first. The A330-200 was clean, aromatic tropical scent in the cabin air, nice island music was playing and they had mood lighting. The flight attendants went above and beyond to assist us. The inflight entertainment was free, food was hot. Seats were over the wing right side, 27H/J it was a 2-4-2 configuration. Though they were economy there plenty of leg room, but aisles are narrow though. Upon arrival in Honolulu were were escorted through all checkpoints and ferried to baggage clain by a valet. I cannot praise enough the Hawaiian staff.

### "no lie-flat beds"
Hawaiian Airlines apparently hasn't purchased a new plane in 5 years. They have no idea that the rest of the airline world accommodates first class customers in actual comfort during overnight flights. We had high hopes for this flight, having never flown Hawaiian Air before. We started out on a good note with their signature drink - Pukana La, which is champagne, pineapple juice and grenadine. Our flight was 8 hours, departing just past midnight, and I envisioned the typical amenities we're accustomed to on overnight flights. To our great surprise upon boarding, there were no lie-flat beds or personal seating compartments. The narrow seats didn't even have electronic controls. We had to manually adjust the recline (minimal) and the foot rest (pathetic), which didn't elevate. The seats were something out of the dark ages. Sleep was painful, almost impossible. Attendants handed out cheap headphones that hurt my ears, while other airlines are providing Bose now. The inflight entertainment is littered with ads that you must watch each time you choose another movie or TV show. It's not enough they're charging a fortune to fly, but now you have to watch ads too. They shut off in-flight entertainment half an hour before landing, ridiculous. Some allow video to continue right through landing. Hawaiian Air switches you to a 30-minute music video promoting Hawaiian musicians (entitled HISessions), after they take away your earphones. Whose ingenius idea was that? We were absolutely freezing the entire trip. It didn't help that the blanket provided was wimpy. I kept a coat on during the entire flight. The attendants were all turning blue. The overnight kit was cheap - cheap earplugs that didn't stay in, cheap eye mask that didn't keep light out, cheap thin socks (which I had to wear over my own socks to avert frozen feet). The food was horrific. Salmon omelet? Good grief, who eats fish in an omelet? And fishy tasting salmon, no less. Greasy, cold chicken sausage and rubbery potatoes for sides. Ugh. The first class cabin on Hawaiian Airlines might equal Economy Plus on the better airlines. Even the uniforms are awful. Drab gray pants, with blue floral shirts that don't match. What were they thinking? The only saving grace on this flight were two flight attendants who did their very best to make our flight bearable, despite miserable conditions in a prehistoric plane. Never again will we fly Hawaiian Airlines.

### "service is worse than non-existent"
Flew PHX to KOA via HNL with Hawaiian Airlines. The plane left 3 hours late as the engine was broken and they were fixing it. I had a 1 hour layover in Honolulu and therefore would miss my connection to Kona. I spoke to the Hawaiian Airlines agent at the gate and told him I would book a later flight with my smartphone. He told me not to do that as Hawaiian was going to book new flights for all passengers with a connecting flight and my doing it myself would mess everything up. When we arrived at Honolulu, the plane pulled off the runway and stopped. The crew said we would have to be towed into the terminal. The crew then told all passengers that we should get off at gate 52 and there would be a shuttle waiting to take the passengers with connections to the interisland terminal. We were then to go to gate 56 where Hawaiian Airlines personnel would be waiting to take care of our connecting flights. There was no shuttle waiting. A shuttle going the other direction stopped and the driver asked what we were doing. We told him and he said no shuttle was scheduled to meet us but that he would turn around and take us to the Interisland terminal. When we got to the interisland terminal and went to gate 56 there were no Hawaiian Airlines personnel anywhere. After waiting a while, one of the other passengers said she was going to go look for help. We got new tickets and finally got to Kona. Passenger service is worse than non-existent. We go to Hawaii every year and this is the 4th time Hawaiian has messed us about, the 5th time was when we came back from this trip. We're done with Hawaiian permanently.

### "service was also outstanding"
I flew Hawaiian Airlines from Los Angeles to Kahului return on a week-long Hawaiian holiday with my wife, our 2 young sons and my parents. We booked our seats in what HA calls "premium economy" which is actually the same seating as economy but with more legroom, priority boarding and complimentary meal service. We booked a centre row (4 abreast) and a window row (2 abreast) at a fare that was significantly less than that of the competition's premium economy fares. The aircraft on the outbound sector was a 3 year-old A330-200 that was clean and in good condition, and the inbound sector was a 4.5 year-old A330-200 that was in equally good condition. Each seat has its own IFE monitor with a decent array of programmes. The food is actually not bad, and excellent by airline food standards. The service was also outstanding - Hawaiian and Virgin America have by far the friendliest and most efficient cabin service, not at all like that of the unionised drones that work Delta, American and United. Both flights were on time. If you're flying to/from Hawaii, Hawaiian Airlines is definitely your best choice.

### "our favourite to fly with"
We have travelled 14 times to honolulu and beyond with Hawaiian Airlines and every trip has been fantastic. We are regular travellers to Europe and the US and have flown with some good and bad airlines and have to say Hawaiian Airlines are our favourite to fly with.

### "fly again for right price"
We found Hawaiian Airlines decent in the air but terrible ground service before and during our trip. The website is archaic in that you cannot book a child online, we had to ring and book our 3 year old who was then on a separate booking code etc which made checking in, changing seats etc a pain (Hawaiian sat him in different areas of the plane to us despite being a minor). Website advises you can book a bassinet for babies, however upon calling up you discover its an extra $140 each way for the privilege. Website does not state this! Ground staff in Honolulu were atrocious and getting any assistance with our complicated check in (kids, kid stuff, separate booking numbers, through ticket to Lihue etc etc) was like pulling teeth and we only got assistance when i turned on the tears (and we are experienced travellers, never have I encountered such useless customer service staff). Our bags then miss the flight but they did turn up on the next one. In the air we were quite happy. Brisbane to Honolulu return in the A330. Flight crew were helpful, accommodating with the baby and 3 year old, nice comfort kit provided as well as pillows and blankets, regular drink runs, food not terrible, plane clean, eat back entertainment free and with a decent veriety, good luggage allowance, flights on time. Honolulu to Lihue and return is a quick flight, they give you a beverage. All in all I would fly them again for the right price, as in the air they were fine. Just dont try to get any assistance out of them before or during your trip!

### "lack of Customer Support"
Hawaiian Airlines used to be "the" airline to fly, but seem to have lost their "Hawaiian roots. They have become far too big. It started when they moved their phone support overseas. They crammed more seats into economy class, and reduced level of service in first class. They started charging excessive baggage fees, change fees, and cancellation fees. Their frequent flyer program has become just another cash cow, charging 100.00 per ticket plus mileage if flying inter island. Our Party of 5, all under a single reservation number, were given 2 seats and 3 members given Standby Seats at the ticket counter, even though the reservations were made and seats selected 6 months in advance. We were told that we would have to talk to the gate agent, who only showed up 10 minutes before the plane was scheduled for departure. Luckily all 5 of us were able to get on the same flight, split all about the cabin. Customer support after the fact was incredibly arrogant and unwilling to explain company policy of splitting reservations between assigned seats and Standby status. Complete lack of Customer Support seems to be their new business model.

### "No one to help or support us"
Los Angeles to Honolulu, and our first time flying with Hawaiian Airlines. We had asked for assistance as I am a disabled with mobility problems. Kerbside check in was a breeze and it was easy to navigate T2 at LAX. The problems started when we got on board. The aircraft had been overfueled and had to be changed. We sat there for 2 hours waiting for them to arrive. We were given some water and the movies were switched on but nothing else. Cabin crew were good and they were in the dark as we were. However, instead of selling snacks, they could have offered them as a gesture of goodwill. We were then asked to leave the aircraft. Bad enough if you are able bodied, worse if you are disabled. A nice ground crew guy returned my wheelchair to me and we slowly made our way back to the gate. Once we got there, we were turned around and asked to get back on the aircraft as the problem had been resolved. We finally took off three hours late. There were also delays with the luggage at HNL as there were apparently only two loaders available to deal with baggage. I gave up waiting for my wheelchair after 15 minutes and slowly made my own way with my wife helping me. No one from Hawaiian Airlines ground crew were about to direct, help or support us. Thanks to the kindness of fellow passengers we got our bags and finally got to the car rental desk. The operational support for Hawaiian Airlines failed dismally. There were lacklustre apologies and a distinct lack of ground staff to help. Considering HNL is their home airport, this is totally unacceptable.

### "they are way behind the times"
Hawaiian Airlines are the most disorganised, unfriendly and rudest airline. We booked months ago through our agent, but she was advised that she was unable to book our seats for us and we can't book them online either. Upon arrival at Brisbane Airport, we line up to check in and wait and wait and wait while they have a staff meeting. When checkin finally opens we discover my husband and I are seated apart! To sit together will incur a further charge of $120. The plane is full we were told, we can't move you. Seriously - has it been full for 6 months? It wasn't full at all - there were plenty of people lying down over 3 seats. After a lot of argument we finally get seats together. Upon arrival in Honolulu, we're held up at the gate for 35 minutes because they can't get the airbridge to work. Very uncomfortable. In customs, the computers are down so we wait in a queue for 2 hours to get through. The Customs Usher told us to go to a newly opened desk, only to have the Customs Officer scream at us to get back in line and only approach his desk when he had given us permission to do so. He kept on yelling and yelling at us, over the sign on his desk which says Welcome to Hawaii. I know this is not Hawaiian Airlines fault but by this stage our impression of Hawaii is sinking by the minute. Whilst on holiday, we receive the distressing news that my mother has died, so we need to cut our holiday short and fly back. We are charged $400 extra to change our flights to a week earlier - once again on a flight which was not full. So we don't understand why we had to pay extra. We arrive at the Hawaiian Airlines desk to find that once again we are seated far apart, even though we are travelling together as husband and wife. The seriously rude women on the counter at the gate asked us why we wanted to sit together and advised us there would be a charge for changing the tickets. At this time I am very distressed and my normally placid husband starts to lose it. The way she spoke to us was beyond belief and extremely distressing. After a lot of argument we finally got to sit together (the plane was not full), but I think she took revenge because my suitcase was sent to Sydney, not Brisbane. More stress, trying to recover that. thankfully Qantas took over and found it and delivered it with amazing efficiency. Most of the cabin crew were very nice - so that was something. Although on the return trip one officious steward told me to remove my headset every time the fasten seat belt sign came on, in case I needed to get out of my seat quickly. In all my years of flying I have never been told that. And he told me every single time there was turbulence. None of the other stewards told passengers that, I think he was just on a little power trip. With the appalling way we have been treated by Hawaiian airlines and Hawaii customs we will never ever return. There is nothing welcoming, friendly or competent about the Hawaiian Airline service at all. They seriously need to review their customer experience levels because they are way behind the times. They are worse than 3rd world.

### "unfriendly cabin crew"
Hawaiian Airlines from Brisbane to Honolulu. Never have I encountered such surly, sullen and unfriendly cabin crew. They bordered on being outright rude! I never saw a smile from any of them. You would think that flying to Hawaii - such a beautiful and welcoming place - would make everyone happy, but no, not the crews either on the way there or back. Add to that the food was almost inedible. The plane itself was clean (apart from the toilet) but I doubt I would fly with this airline again.

### "flight attendants are okay"
San Diego to Honolulu and I like Hawaiin Airlines. I have now flown with them twice. I like how the captain of the flight tells you over the intercom what islands you are flying over and other information. The seats are comfortable and the flight attendants are okay. I am happy to get to my destination safely and relaxed.

### "the most uncomfortable seats"
We purchased Hawaiian Airlines Extra comfort seats 9 months prior to departure. Arrived at the gate for our flight to Honolulu to find all extra comfort seats are unavailable on our flight and we had been reassigned economy class seats. Due to medical conditions of some passenger, we were advised by ground staff that a spare seat would be available next to us in economy class to give us extra room on the flight. 5 minutes before the doors are closed these spare seats are filled with standby passengers! Will not fly again with an airline that is more interested in filling seats that looking after their full fare paying customers. Economy class seats are some of the most uncomfortable seats I have ever flown in with little leg room.

### "outraged at this charge"
I booked this flight about 10 months before we flew. Six weeks before our flight I contacted Hawaiian Airlines and requested a travel credit as the cost of the flight was now $130 less than I had paid. Hawaiian was willing to give me a travel credit for the $130 difference only after they charged me $40/ticket to process the travel credit. I'm outraged at this charge as neither Jet Blue nor Alaska Airlines charges a customer for process a travel credit when the customer finds the same flight listed for less than previously paid. While the flight attendants and gate attendants are pleasant their efforts are not enough to overcome my irritation about the charge for processing my travel credit. Additionally, on my flight to Honolulu and from Honolulu we landed/departed from Gate 34. This gate is a very long walk from the main terminal. Hawaiian should provide a shuttle to assist customers who have to walk to baggage claim or from the main terminal. While I did use online check-in, it saved me little or no time because I had to access one of the kiosks at the main terminal to print out by my baggage tracking label. There was no curbside check-in for baggage and about 1/3 of the kiosks were out of order. I've flown Hawaiian many times over the past 12 years. This will be the last one. Hello Alaska Airlines!

### "gate staff were extremely rude"
I would never recommend Hawaiian Airlines to anyone. The Brisbane Airport gate staff were extremely rude and unprofessional. We were travelling with a infant and a 7 year old - how could we be seperated from a 7 year old? We had paid for premium economy seats and were told at the gate our party of 6 would all be sitting in seperate seats. We paid and booked 8 months plus in advance for this Hawaiian Airlines trip.

### "clumsy is the best description"
Hawaiian Airlines has become a lower class carrier that is trying to serve selected routes in and around the Pacific Rim. Clumsy is the best description I can give. We flew one way from Tokyo Haneda to Honolulu with a departure time of 23:55. Kind of a non eventful flight but I kept getting woke up by clumsy crew who kept bumping into my seat. Once okay, twice not a big deal, 6 times just shows a lack of care. One of the staff actually spilled an entire glass of water on someone, just clumsy. The food was on the lower side of airline fare with no snacks. They did have IFE to watch which was a relief and a contradiction to what I had read in other reviews. There are a flew classes, the standard is free with two upgrade options. I flown worse so there is hope but I think I'd check all resources in the future prior to selecting Hawaiian Airlines. Aircraft was reasonably clean and in good working order. Bathrooms were getting worse as the flight progressed. I believe WiFI was offered at a steep price.

### "I was met with friendly faces "
Sydney to Hilo via Honolulu on Hawaiian Airlines in Business class. I was met with friendly faces and enjoyed the flight cocktails which flowed freely. The meals were also great. I have been using Hawaiian for 12 years and it's the crews that keep me loyal, they are caring and professional. The ground staff bend over backwards to make sure I receive the status benefits.

### "seat felt straight out of the 1980s again"
First trip with Hawaiian Airlines. Online check-in was user friendly and bag drop at LAX was quick. The Hawaiian lounge in LAX is pretty awful, like a dated living room from the 80s (the lounge attendant told us it was due to close the following day). In the end we used Priority Pass to use the Air Canada Maple Leaf lounge which was great. Boarding was orderly and quick. The first class cabin is quite small and seems to take up about half of the space between the first and second set of cabin doors. The first class seat was comfortable but basic, reasonable width and legroom but not lie flat and for a tall guy it was not easy to get into a comfortable lying position. So although on a modern aircraft the seat felt straight out of the 80s again. The IFE was excellent, good choice and on demand with a decent size screen. What stood out about this flight was the cabin crew. We had a Los Angeles based crew with two crew working in the first class cabin. They were professional, friendly, warm and offered a great service. There were regular services and offers of drink top ups. Hawaiian could be a really great airline if they upgraded the first class seating and offered better lounges.

### "my Hawaiian Airlines experience was horrible"
After 2 hours, 3 agents, 2 supervisors, 1 manager and a gate agent my experience with Hawaiian Airlines was horrible. Had paid for and confirmed Comfort Class seats. When boarding passes were received they were regular coach seats. In a condescending and rude way I was told the Comfort Class seats were canceled by an outside source. Comparable seats were now not available. Only option was coach seats and a Credit for what was paid for upgrade.

### Hawaiian Airlines customer review
Once again Hawaiian proves that economy class passengers can be treated well and comfortably. We paid for "extra comfort" seats on the Honolulu-Las Vegas leg both ways. For $70 each, each way, we got tremendous leg room and the 2+4+2 seating allowed my wife and I to have our own aisle and window row. Nice complimentary meals were served each way, along with a small glass or wine or mai tai. As to value, our two roundtrip tickets costs about $2000 and that was with a 50% discount on one fare due to their credit card. (You don't get a 50% discount on the $140 extra comfort seat upcharge for the roundtrip). We were willing to pay this for very comfortable flights at the more popular times. We did not look to see if we could have saved money by being cramped on an ultra low cost carrier, not did we check out the prices on the legacy airline competitors. Hawaiian has convinced us that they deliver a pleasant economy class experience which is becoming very unusual these days.

### Hawaiian Airlines customer review
Flight operated by Ohana for Hawaiian. Thirty five minute flight from KIA to OGG. Aircraft clean and tidy drinks offered en route. Being a small commuter plane very cramped but not a problem on such a short flight. Departed and arrived on time, no complaints.

### Hawaiian Airlines customer review
Much the same as the outward flight, same operator Ohana and aircraft a turbo prop ATR. Had problems at the gate with our booking for this one but sorted by friendly gate staff. Thirty five minute flight back to Kona all normal arrived early. No complaints.

### Hawaiian Airlines customer review
Flight was excellent, online check-in easy but bag drop off took a while as the first class line was slower then economy lines. No express line at security but didn't take long. Food was nice as was the bloody Mary's for the morning flight, crew always helpful and attentive. On landing in Honolulu we were advised there was no gate for us and we would need to wait 10-15 minutes, no problem as I had over an hour to make my connection. An hour later we were still on the plane sitting on Tarmac, everybody advised the crew of connecting flights, the crew announced that we would be rescedualed as they would not hold our connections. After an hour they found a gate for us. I ran and they had held the Hilo flight, the crew at that gate said they did not know that the Vegas flight was delayed so they waiting for the rest of the Vegas passengers, well done to the ground crew at inter island terminal. Honolulu is expanding to fast to keep up with infrastructure.

### Hawaiian Airlines customer review
I am sad to say that we were not allowed on our flight today because we were not at the boarding gate fifteen minutes before departure. Even though we were allowed to check in with our two children 6 months and 2. Once we got to the gate exactly 15 minutes before takeoff our agent kept his head down staring at his computer for about 5 minutes. After that he informed us that the gates were closed and no one else could board. Strange because atleast two other people were allowed on the plane while we were standing at the checkin counter. I felt embarrassed as other people were allowed onto the flight while we were held off to the side. I am not sure if they didn't want to let us on because we had the two small children or they didn't like the way we looked. I would not recommend anyone to this airline ever. In fact I would urge you to stay away from them as you can see their other reviews on here are pretty bad as well. If anyone knows a way I can get my family out to Hawaii asap please share. Hawaiian air customer service has given us the run around and made light of our situation.

### Hawaiian Airlines customer review
Flying Hawaiians seasonal non stop was a pleasure. Comfortable seating, warm service and good food were the highlights of a pleasant comfortable experience. Nothing to add but a hearty recommendation. I actually prefer the older 767s over the newer A330's. Even the luggage was delivered in a timely manner.

### Hawaiian Airlines customer review
The good: Efficient boarding, departed and arrived on time. The so so: Cabin attendants did their jobs, legroom OK, but less than jetBlue. The bad: "Entertainment" - Why have in-seat TV screen when nothing worthwhile to watch, unless you pay extra for it? Meal" - water, few pieces of fruit, mystery cheese thing, one piece of candy. Overall opinion: Very average experience. Hawaiian should be so much better when their slogan is "Hawaii Flies With Us". Should not boast about serving a meal, attendants OK, but lack aloha spirit, delete ads when giving info about Hawaii before landing. Would fly again, but only because of mediocre competitors.

### Hawaiian Airlines customer review
I am never flying on Hawaiian Airlines again. Once was once too many! Horrible customer service. 1) Luggage issues. They refused to send my bags all the way to the final destination. Their response was "because you have a layover of more than 4 hours, we cannot send the bags all the way. This was blatantly false because I later confirmed with people who had flown the exact same route and they had no issues checking their bags all the way to the final destination. Some incompetent staff, for sure! 2) In-flight service for an international flight was atrocious. When I reminded the attendant that I had requested a special meal, she replied rather rudely, "Oh, we don't do special meals. 3) Good luck trying to change your flights without paying a hefty amount. And even then, you were restricted to a few dates only.

### Hawaiian Airlines customer review
We have flown Hawaiian airlines about 8 times, and it has been satisfying every time. The service is very good, the seat is comfortable (especially the pillows), the food is pretty good and the legroom is comfortable. We fly this airline about once every two years, and it's been very satisfying. They are kid friendly too.

### Hawaiian Airlines customer review
AKL-HNL on a modern A330 in Extra Comfort seat in 11A. An excellent option at a small cost for the 9 hr long overnight flight. Whilst the seat was the same as Economy Class and the armrest was fixed, this row is situated directly behind Business Class in a small intimate cabin at the front of the plane. The leg room was huge, improving comfort and thus the ability to get some sleep. Return HNL-AKL afternoon flight was in standard Economy seat 18A and whilst a little tight when the person in front reclined, it was perfectly adequate and comfortable. On-demand movies / TV series / games were free and it was fun to watch some Hawaii-centric shows. The touch screen was not very responsive and there was no alternative controls resulting in a lot of unnecessary "poking". Upon embarkation, FA's handed out amenity kits comprising eye masks, headphones, earplugs and in Extra Comfort seats additional items were included in a cute little pouch. Food and drink service was prompt after takeoff and I think relevant to the time of travel. A snack pack was offered at midnight with a breakfast before arrival then on the return a hot chicken/rice dish at late PM takeoff with a sandwich as a late supper. Much better than a curry at 3am as I have experienced on some airlines. Service friendliness and professionalism was mixed depending on which crew member attended you (as always) and the return was much better but overall more than adequate. Water was offered frequently throughout the flight. My only negative would be the temperature of the cabin - it was freezing cold! The FA's were even wearing cardigans. And the complimentary blanket smelled like it had been in a smokers zone - it was disgusting. Fortunately I had packed my own. Overall I was very impressed with the flights. It represented good value and the inclusion 2 checked bags in the fare was a bonus. I would recommend this airline for this route and will fly with them again. It's a shame Honolulu Airport is their hub - it is woeful and not a pleasant experience.

### Hawaiian Airlines customer review
Chaos at the airport which is more the fault of the airport administration than the airline. Though it would be nice about the need to take a shuttle to the gate and there is nothing available at gate 34 except sandwich, sweets and drinks at highly inflated prices. Impressed with the cabin crew and range of inflight entertainment - although any announcement that was made whilst I using it nearly blasted my eardrums. Not quite as cold as my earlier flight but still needed the blanket. Flight was smooth and the landing feather like.

### Hawaiian Airlines customer review
My husband and I were disappointed with the inflight experience from Honolulu to Sydney (arriving SYD 7.30pm). The staff were cold, sullen and non-communicative. The food was minimal and of poor quality. We were given a terrible chicken meal at lunch and then nothing until the equivalent of 11pm (for the passengers' day), when we received sub standard sandwiches. We have never experienced an international flight like it. Additionally, the entertainment systems were problematic in that the touch screen was not sensitive enough and had to be pressed repeatedly. As a result, I had the woman behind me repeatedly pressing the back of my headrest all the way through the 10 hour flight. We will never choose this airline again for an international flight.

### Hawaiian Airlines customer review
I don't usually fly business class, so this was a treat. The first class check-in was fantastic. The seats were only recliner, but very comfortable. I didn't need full flat anyway, as it was not overnight. Attendants were attentive and professional. Food was very good. In-flight entertainment was varied, and had some documentaries available that were very interesting.

### Hawaiian Airlines customer review
Check in at Brisbane was poor, the machines didn't work and there seemed to be a shortage of staff. When I finally reached the counter, the young lady was polite and helpful. The actual flight was good, except the cabin was freezing and really needed that blanket. I was involved as a helper in a medical emergency and was impressed with the care and attention given by the crew. Found the shell like seats a little hard.

### Hawaiian Airlines customer review
I was so looking forward to my trip to Honolulu, but it was not a pleasant experience, was seated next to window with 1 passenger next to me, as soon as we had levelled off the woman in front of me thrust her seat back to the maximum degree and that's where it stayed the entire 8.5 hour trip, until she was asked by staff to return her
seat to upright position 5 mins from landing. I have scoliosis and prefer to sit upright, but I was left with no room whatsoever, could not even open a magazine, I was severely restricted of any movement and trying to get out the seat to visit the toilet was near impossible, if people want to sleep the whole trip like that they should
travel 1st class and why do the seats have to go so far back. By the time we arrived in Hawaii I was in pain. I was dreading the return trip home, but just dismissed it as bad luck, the return trip I was seated in an aisle seat with empty seat next to me, well the same thing happened we hadn't even taken off and a woman put her seat
right back, I thought surely staff would correct her but obviously they didn't spot her, as soon as we had levelled out again I moved into the seat next to me, her 4 year old son was now in front of me, she then proceeded to push her sons seat back to the extended position, was this really necessary for a 4 year old, the only respite I had was move back to the aisle seat at least I was able to exit the seat so spent much of my time standing at back of airline, how could people be so oblivious to other travellers discomfort by having their seats fully extended the entire trip is beyond me, I certainly wont be travelling with this airline again it was a nightmare trip for me.

### Hawaiian Airlines customer review
Our flight from Brisbane to Honolulu (overnight) was good even though an awful time to fly. My only complaint was the cabin was freezing. On the return flight this is where the problems started. The airport is mayhem and needs more signage. People wondering aimlessly. Once on board and seated. I had packed for warmth on this flight. It was a day flight leaving at 1.40pm local time. Once on board we were informed that there was no headsets, they had not been loaded onto the plane. so for the next 9 hours plus no movies, how many games can you play of Solitaire. Also on the first meal service we where informed there was no scotch as they had run out. First meal service. That is not good enough. The staff were polite, the meals OK but for an international carrier to have no headsets for a 9 hour flight is ridiculous, and concerning. Hawaiian Airlines need to pick up their game, as in pre-checks and cross checks and strict compliance procedures that must be adhered too for safety and well being of your passengers.

### Hawaiian Airlines customer review
Flight from Hilo to Honolulu, new cabin, seat 5B. The new seats are perfect for the 50 min fight - lots of legroom and comfortable. Staff as normal are perfect and professional. Only negative is I could not check in online and when I called tech support line it is horrible, always has been. Very rarely can they fix problems and can often give incorrect information.

### Hawaiian Airlines customer review
HA30 May 28 2015. Staff at desk were cold and rude though not busy at all. Couldn't get into the Premier Lounge again third time that has happened. New scanner didn't work and we just gave up. They pre loaded a very elderly couple into our selected seats in 1st class without checking their tickets. When we went to board we were addressed like we had the wrong tickets then informed that the couple took too long to settle in and we could have their middle row in the back seats. Right in front of a comfort seat of a crying child and with a broken stuck tray table. Attendant knowing I was upset with our seating avoided us so no beverages and service at first. Then the male attendant offered to move the people though he didn't mean to made the people around look at us like we should be shamed for being mad. We were the last to be asked about meals so we got what was left curry in salad dressing really? Food was dry. The people in our seats had our desired meal too. Save your money and take Alaska Air.

### Hawaiian Airlines customer review
HA7 8th May 2015. My 5.5 hour flight from Las Vegas to Honalulu was the worst flight I have travelled on. Cabin temperature was freezing and when I asked for a blanket was informed that I would have to pay for this a pillow would also be provided as part of this fee (a lot of help that would be to me when I arrived in Honolulu). The 'meal service' if you could call it that was appalling. Our meal consisted of soggy watermelon cantaloupe and a few grapes served with cheese and crackers. Also informed that to use the inflight entertainment I would have to purchase a set of aircraft earphones as well as pay per view for movies/TV shows. So much for the Aloha friendly airline advertised on their ensuite. Flight staff were rude and unhelpful obviously not happy to be in the job. Hawaiian Airlines- you got me this time but never again!

### Hawaiian Airlines customer review
Sydney - Honolulu - Hilo. Today I was impressed with Hawaiian econ plus seat 11G I normally travel business class but was fully booked. Staff at Sydney check in were very good typical friendly while being professional. Boarding was good business and families first then econ plus. The seat is in a row 11 just behind business and has excellent leg room it's also in a quiet 3 row section away from the main cabin. Cabin crew excellent as usual high degree of customer service. During a medical problem on board they were very professional and showed honest care for the customer. The food for econ was very hot when served constant drinks available throughout the flight. Overall very impressed. 2 negatives having to pay for lounge entry in Sydney for platinum Hawaiian when platinum velocity can get in free. Next the ground crew at the inter island terminal were nowhere even close to the flight crew in customer service skills. The short island hop was in first as a free upgrade again friendly professional crew.

### Hawaiian Airlines customer review
Our family of four recently flew from Brisbane to Honolulu return with Hawaiian Airlines. We found ourselves to be pleasantly surprised by the airline. All of our flights were on schedule the service from crew was very friendly and helpful. For example on one flight our daughter wasn't hungry at the time our first meal was served. Later in the flight we asked what food options were available to purchase and the flight attendant then returned with a spare full meal. I also liked the fact that the staff offered water numerous times throughout the flight and also collected rubbish at very regular intervals. More so than anything other flight I have been on and I really appreciated these small measures which add to the enjoyment of the flight. The seats were comfortable enough with sufficient leg room. Would like to see a little more variety in the entertainment offered (movie and television show wise). We found the check in process not to be completely straight forward. Both occasions on checking in the machines were not working correctly. We then had to be checked in by a staff member at the desk. Overall though I would definitely fly with Hawaiian Airlines again.

### Hawaiian Airlines customer review
We flew non-stop from New York to HNL. On the way there we tried extra comfort. Staff were great plane was late getting into JFK but made up time and we arrived only about 20 min late. Seats were ok. Boarding was good also. On the way back to JFK non stop from HNL we bought first class seats - what a disappointment. Seats are about as good as extra comfort nothing better. Food was not good at all. They need to look into United first class seats which recline almost to flat status or look into SAS. Staff at Hawaiian on both flights were great but the rest was terrible.

### Hawaiian Airlines customer review
We recently flew Hawaiian Air from Seattle to Maui and return. Return flight was delayed and we had nothing but good come from it. They were very apologetic and one of the girls at the gate did a Hula dance for us and gave volunteers lessons. I enjoyed every minute of the flight there and back and liked the A30 airbus. It was our first experience flying Hawaiian Air and we will be flying it again next year to Maui. We were alerted via email that there was a delay so got to stay by the pool for a bit longer!

We were instructed to confirm our onward flight to San Francisco when we reached Honolulu. Flight to SFO was next day (4th Feb). Rang to confirm this flight and were informed because of a time change in the flight we had to have a new ticket issued and that we would have to ring our agent in Australia to enable this to happen. We rang our agent who checked with Hawaiian Airlines Sydney office to be told no that our ticket that we held was fine and it was when we checked in. I had to make a call to Australia which was not easy and it took nearly 2 hours of our precious time in Honolulu. Not good. Also the food on the plane although I had requested a meal without tomato and mushrooms there was no option. One meal was all that was available and we had it twice with tomato which disagrees with me.

We traveled business class return Brisbane - Honolulu on new Airbus A300 aircraft. Only two negatives were limited pitch of business class seats as did not fully lie flat and limited movie selection on in flight entertainment. Food and inflight service was excellent.

### Hawaiian Airlines customer review
We flew Sydney-Honolulu-Sydney. We paid for extra comfort upgrades. We sat in seats 11A and 11B on the way to Honolulu and on the way back 14H and 14J. These seats provided a great amount of legroom for what we paid. The seats themselves were the most uncomfortable seats I've flown in - very hard. The service however was good. All crew members were friendly and flights departed and arrived on schedule. The food was pretty good as well.

### Hawaiian Airlines customer review
ITO-HNL-LAX return. Bulking at the cost of suitcases on the first leg of a trip to the UK we bought Premier Club cards as we checked in online. We understood matters would not tie up instantly and expected difficulties with the famously belligerent HA ground staff. This was not the case at Hilo where the charming early morning desk hand gave us the code for the lounge (for coffee) and sent us on our way. Well fine but HNL proved true to course Having got our boarding passes certified we went to board as Zone two only to have them snatched by a woman standing next to the line we wanted who said as loudly as possible " This is first class you can not board here! Now we were not trying to board there and how prey does anybody which line which when they are not marked? Are HA loyal customers clairvoyant? On board good planes they do give passenger food in this case a good fruit breakfast and a rum cocktail before landing. Route back OK. Sad lounge at LAX but it is LAX nobody can work miracles and the on board service was good enough. Whether Premier Club is worth it only time will tell. I hope some of the money paid goes to training ground staff.

Just booked OAK-OGG in 1st last night. Price was right after watching it for a week. This will be our 3rd trip to Maui in two years going with HA in 1st. Service has always been great with HA. Food good presentation well done. Wish there was more room in the 767's they use for this route. But fear that with the Slated smaller A/C proposed to take over this route we're not fans of in the least bit. Sure the 767's are showing their age but the staff tend to make the flights well worth it. In fact on last trip I left items at the check-in counter and didn't realize it until we were on the plane. Got off the plane and spoke with gate agent. She confirm with check-in person my items were there and that they'd store them until we returned since it was close to us departing. And to my surprise the check-in agent boarded the plane and handed me my items!

### Hawaiian Airlines customer review
We flew return from Sydney to LAX then returning from Las Vegas. Of 4 flights only one left on-time. The flight from Honolulu to LAX left 2 hours late because of delayed fuelling. This happened again from Las Vegas (1h15m wait) and the flight was already delayed by 14 hours due to crew working hours. Our connection from HNL to Sydney (already 1 day late) left the gate but had a flat tire and we waited 1 hour to fix it. Honolulu to Sydney the entertainment system did not work for over an hour and when it was rebooted the "Movies on Demand" were not free as advertised on the website for International Passengers. I did ask about not having to pay $7.99 per film but the flight attendant didn't seem to appreciate my request and ignored my call button for the duration of the trip. Staff seemed intent on hiding behind curtains. Poor service onboard and the Customer Service department is equally poor. 24 working days to get a response. I won't be using Hawaiian again – avoid at all costs!

### Hawaiian Airlines customer review
We snagged $1300 return to Seattle as part of a Canada a trip with a stopover in Hawaii for 3 days on the way back. For the price paid and considering we are a family of five could not complain. Staff are friendly with constant drink top ups and smiles. Meals are not huge and the lack of free entertainment is a small problem. I guess if I had paid a premium price I would of been a bit let down as the other airlines out there are better. I would definitely fly them again if the price was right.

### Hawaiian Airlines customer review
They do not have their own staff for check in at JFK there were 4 kiosks and only 2 worked. The staff were not welcoming or friendly and borderline rude. They kept mostly to themselves and barely smiled during JFK-HNL - no aloha spirit. Video selection was limited and a la carte not one free movie they charged for everything even regular tv-cable shows that are free on other carriers. The Hawaiian Airlines video history and commercials with smiling friendly flight crew are free. We were treated to 2 gourmet packets of stale crushed peanut mix during the 10.5 hr flight. They don't give whole soda cans - just cups of beverage. Meal was half heated pasta with tomato paste - so eat well before boarding. Being a Hawaiian living in NYC I did so much to promote this airline in NYC within my social circles company and whenever I can. It breaks my heart to see how they have completely disintegrated as a company and lost the spirit of aloha. I travel frequently throughout the year and have flown on all carriers in USA - Hawaiian Airlines is the worst for the cost and experience. There are much better cheaper carrier/options.

### Hawaiian Airlines customer review
ITO-HNL. Early morning check-in usual poor attitude from ground staff HA seems to like to employ. Flight on time though with their "New" boarding process (zones 1 2 and 3) they insist on boarding the plane backwards. Anyway it was the usual overhead bins at the back of the plane were full and closed. What do they ship to take four and a half bins out of service? Drink service on the short flight the coffee was quite good. The way back really showed how poor the inter-island flights are now HA have a virtual monopoly. Full flight standard HA board in reverse and low and behold the overhead bins at the back are full again despite no passengers being in the seats yet. Find somewhere to stow carry on but told to put laptop under the seat in front. It does not fit and with the already meagre seat pitch I ended up with my knees almost on my ears. Water or sugary juice to drink from plastic containers It all shows how far HA have fallen since Aloha failed. I dread my next flights this coming week.

### Hawaiian Airlines customer review
Such an average airline. Travelled first class Honolulu to Sydney. The service was poor and the seats very uncomfortable. If travelling between Australia and Honolulu book on either Qantas or save money on Jetstar. Avoid this airline.

### Hawaiian Airlines customer review
I travelled on 3 flights with Hawaiian airlines. From Oahu to Maui Maui to Oahu then Oahu to New York. I was surprised to be charged $25 per flight for the short island flights per bag put into the hold. But my main issue was that unlike all other airlines Hawaiian airlines do not cater for non meat eaters. If you are a vegetarian there are no food options for you even on the 9hr flight from Oahu to New York. In this day and age that is totally unacceptable.

Sydney-Honolulu-JFK early October and back same route. Positives - no delay clean cabin reasonably clean lavatory friendly cabin crew 60kg check-in luggage. Negatives - more expensive than most other airlines. No meal choice - chicken and rice only salad inedible. Poor navigation on console choice of movies/TV limited. Meagre snacks cost extra only water is free during flight. Honolulu airport check-in and security hall is overcrowded and poorly air-conditioned. US domestic leg clearly sub-standard compared to int'l route. Overall typical boring American-style airline with nothing to be remembered for. If you are used to Qantas or any good Asian or Middle Eastern airlines then you are in for a real cattle class ride. Won't be flying with them again at the current price.

I was most disappointed with the Business class lounge in Honolulu the worst I have ever been in. I also thought that for a business class fare I would get a seat with more recline I didn't expect a flat bed. I found it to be a lot more expensive than economy which I used twelve months ago and was quite happy with but thought I would treat myself as I was travelling alone this time.

I flew business class from Sydney to Honolulu. Getting through Sydney airport was a dream no queuing for check-in and expedient trip through both customs and security with priority. The Air New Zealand lounge was adequate clean and comfortable. It is not the best lounge I have spent time in but having said that there was good selection of food and drink. Boarding was effortless and again done with priority. The plane was old and it showed in the console and to a lesser extent the seats. The seats were comfortable plenty of leg room the seat recline was not sufficient enough for a comfortable nights sleep. The leg and foot rest mechanism in my seat was faulty. The staff were wonderful and very attentive both food and drink were plentiful and a good variety to choose from. The entertainment selection was good but a few more recent release movies would have been nice. I had a window seat once the seat in front of me reclined I literally had to climb over the console to be able to go to the toilet. The USB charge facility did not work so don't rely on that. All the above pertains to the trip home as well with the Exception of the Hawaiian Airline Lounge at Honolulu Airport. If your idea of a business class lounge is a cup of coffee or a soft drink then you will be happy. Not only did they not provide anything other than a packet of nuts they do not allow you to take any food or drinks in. I would not bother using it again the point being the lounge facility is part and parcel of flying business and first class and Hawaiian need to lift their game. Again I must say I could not fault the flight staff or the food and beverage services on the aircraft.

Flew Hawaiian from Sydney this August. Could not sit in lounge at airport until just before boarding. Arrived at Honolulu to Big Island. Boarded plane but could not take off. They had no air con. Finally took off but could not disembark. Door could not open. It was an extremely long trip. Coming home we were told just before boarding from Honolulu there would be no audio for. 10 hour flight. I had to upgrade as I cannot sit in a confined space for that amount of time. Seated in business class. The air con was freezing all the way. Given IPads but battery kept running out. Could not rewind to where I finished my movie so had to watch it all over again with another IPad. The air con was freezing all the way home. Even the crew were wearing jackets jumpers etc. it was the worst trip there and back we have ever encounterd. Never again. Could not even get a cup of coffee after dinner. Only tea. Did not have decaf coffee. Someone forgot to make it.

HNL-KOA-HNL in economy. We had a very uneventful flight with Hawaiian Airlines inter-island. They have good teamwork onboard the FA uniforms are really smart the "juice" is rotten (so just get water) up and down and painless flights. In the poorly designed Kona airport I liked how Hawaiian have a ramp for the entry to the plane for wheelchair passengers and everyone with their giant roller bags. Can't imagine how boarding would work with stairs only. They have a monopoly on inter-island travel so it could be far worse.

### Hawaiian Airlines customer review
Gone downhill in the last few years. We're First Class flyers and their food is almost inedible now and it used to be delicious. They've yet to upgrade the dated 767's out of San Jose on their non-stops to Maui. Nothing very special about HA anymore. Their food used to be top notch now we eat before we get on the plane. Not saying much for First Class huh?

### Hawaiian Airlines customer review
Very poor airline when compared to the main airlines. Considering the price we paid for first class the standard service quality of food and overall experience was very poor. We traveled from Honolulu to New York we found the first class lounge to be dirty and lacked any food or drink. The seat on the aircraft did not recline very far the pillow and blanket were the same as in economy food menu only had two selections as for a wine list it did not exist. They need to look at some of the European airlines and learn how it should and can be done.

### Hawaiian Airlines customer review
We were loyal HA flyers for years. We loved that we could finally afford First Class from San Jose to Maui (our favorite place in the world). We try to go 2x yearly. The vacation started on the plane! That was then. Over the last 3 years Hawaiian's First Class services have declined dramatically. Starting with their food. What was a highly rated menu scripted by the GM of the Hali'maile General Store in Maui (great restaurant) is now normal coach nasty airline faire. The speed of the decline is epic. The 'ghetto birds' (767) still flying the non stop route from SJ to OGG are an insult to us Nor Cal folks. Why are the new planes not in place yet? The planes are old tattered and the seating in First Class is more like a glorified coach. Our last trip in January had us on the runway at OGG for 12 hours! Delay after delay we even had a crew switch as laws had them time out. Rude flight attendants were rampant on this trip as well (something we'd never seen on HA prior). Our son was due back at school Monday morning and a flight that was supposed to have us home at 8pm Sunday night had us landing at 7.30am Monday morning. No dinner no drinks nothing that we paid double what coach travellers paid. So this once great airline is no more unfortunately.

I flew first class on 12/8/14 from Seattle to Honolulu. Was very disappointed as the inflight entertainment did not work. For what you pay in first class it should be working I am hoping they will honour my request for a voucher as the ticket was pricey. Please do give better options for food as well. This airline needs to lower its prices for what you get.

### Hawaiian Airlines customer review
Our recent return flight from Honolulu was lacking to say the least. My son and his wife who were honeymooning were seated separately. My son who is quadriplegic was lifted into the aisle seat then a stranger placed in the adjacent window seat which meant the woman would have to repeatedly climb over him to her seat. My son and his wife were travelling with a 16 month old who was a delight throughout the flight. When the steward came through with the meagre sandwich offering we asked for a sandwich for the baby to which she replied 'I will have to see if there are any left'. The baby had no seat but they were charged $300 anyway. Would you not expect a sandwich for that? Especially when there is no food for sale custom laws make it very difficult to bring your own and there are many hours between meals. So mean spirited it took the aloha out of our trip.

We flew Brisbane - Honolulu for the 5th time in August 2nd time with Hawaiian Airlines this time we flew Bus class and was worth paying the extra the service was typically American very friendly and helpful and the food was great with plenty of choices and plenty of drinks. There was an ipad to watch movies for the duration of the flight. All round a great flight and fantastic crew.

### Hawaiian Airlines customer review
In Feb we booked our seats flying from Hawaii to Las Vegas. We booked four seats together as there were personal and mental issues that necessitated careful planning. In August On the day of our flight without consultation Hawaiian Airlines changed our seats. We were separated two of us were put in row 46 and apart. These non reclining seats were a nightmare. I checked the seats we had booked the passengers sitting there were random. To add injury to insult the staff member in Hawaii at the check in counter for our return flight had the arrogance to say there are no non reclining seats on the plane. Maybe Hawaiian Airlines needs to let their staff have the experience from hell. We will never fly Hawaiian Airlines again. We are spreading the word through our large circle of travelling friends.

### Hawaiian Airlines customer review
Flew Brisbane to Honolulu return in last few weeks. Seats comfortable with lots of leg room. No movies shown overnight. Movies shown on way home in the day. Only big screen. Service ok. Food too spicy. Kids meals very good. On way home 2hrs out no toilets in entire plans. Some problem. They didn't announce that though. Check in at Honolulu is entirely self check in. Rather daunting. Wouldn't recommend for elderly not a lot of help around. Would fly them again for excellent luggage allowance!

### Hawaiian Airlines customer review
Flew SYD-HNL-PDX return June/July 2014 with Hawaiian. The price was right and the A330 aircraft configuration of 2-4-2 was handy for couples and family groups alike. Seats were rather hard on the behind after a few hours and getting up to move the limbs is hard if crew are working the aisles with snacks & meals though these weren't too common. It is all pretty no frills stuff though on the international sectors all the in flight entertainment is free but premium content is paid for on domestic sectors. The meals were adequate on international but really a token effort on domestic although Hawaiian claims they are the sole US airline to feed you on domestic sectors anyway. SYD-HNL is overnight so it is best to just try to sleep or doze the night away after they feed you an hour or so out of SYD. a 3 hour layover and HNL-PDX is a daytime flight that arrives just after dark in the last bit of the trip. PDX-HNL is daytime but is a bearable 5.5 hours or so. My most negative comments are about the HNL-SYD sectors flown almost entirely in daytime again staff feed you an hour or two out and do a few rounds of drinks but then want everyone to close the blinds and basically sleep/doze/not bother them for the next 7 hours or so. Overall we got to PDX for a month at a super low fare and knew what to expect having read a number of reviews here so had reasonably low expectations for all the additional things airlines can add to make trips bearable. I'd hate to have paid full price for the trip. Having said that for the same price we'd probably do it again.

We flew Hawaiian Airlines on our recent trip from Auckland to Honolulu return as well as flights from Honolulu to Maui return. We were very pleased with all flights. Air crew planes and all check in staff were excellent and we were pleased to have chosen Hawaiian to fly with. We will definitely fly with them again.

### Hawaiian Airlines customer review
On flight from Sydney to Honolulu on an A330 airbus upgraded to extra comfort seats for an extra $80 per person located behind Business Class plenty of leg room but hard and uncomfortable but little else which doesn't add up to the package offer for the upgrade everything else is the same as in economy. No movies unless you pay for them. Drinks limited to wine or beer. Food on offer is mediocre. Flight attendants friendly I have flown on similar 3 star airlines that provide much more than on offer with this airline. The return flight wasn't much better still had to pay for extras including inflight entertainment snacks which were limited and ran out quickly. Did not upgrade to extra comfort seat this time and not much difference with the same service except for some extra leg room. Don't think I fly with this carrier again as there is better options at the same or near price. Be aware it's self check in at Honolulu airport including luggage.

### Hawaiian Airlines customer review
Not the friendliest crew on this trip. I have flown with Hawaiian before and the staff was great but this time it was complete opposite. On this flight there weren't any pillows or blankets and the plane was cold. There is always one screaming kid and just my luck he was beside me and his Mom and her group of friends really didn't try to calm him down so this happened the entire flight which was about 5.5-6 hrs. The seats were uncomfortable and my seat didn't recline at all. Paid too much for what we ended up with.

### Hawaiian Airlines customer review
Travelled from Honolulu to Sydney. Seats squashed together and hard and uncomfortable. Less room than on an Australian domestic flight. 7.5 hours between lunch and dinner there was a limited range of food available to buy in between meals but best to bring a snack with you. Friendly helpful flight attendants huge luggage allowance (2 x 32 kilo bags) complimentary pillow blanket headphones eye mask and ear plugs: good selection of movies TV shows games and music.

Given health booked business class. Booked wheelchairs and meet and greets. Rang and triple checked on priority on luggage with assistance needed both in Australia and US. Imagine my horror when told flying business first time ever and nil afford told bring own food due to health issues. Spoke with them and sent world-wide advice on what we could take. Told first on first off. Not true. Wheelchair passengers had to sit while able bodied passengers got off first. Told wheelchair would be available would be pushed assistance with luggage - not true. Got sat in first row middle seats about two inches extra width and some silly ramp thing you can push down on and get feet up about 5". Most uncomfortable seats ever. Told because of where we were sat and had no choice even though requested window seat our two backpacks had to be up top at all times so hubby was up and down to get medications food aides the entire flight. No wheelchair on arrival although pre-booked. And last off. Went from Honolulu to Kona no help with luggage consistently having to ask for help and tipping expected. Lounges disgusting at Kona. Return flight worse. All same as above. What did we get for business class prices! Nothing.

I have in my possession an itinerary and confirmation code along with a stated price of $177 for a flight from Hilo to Honolulu May 28 for my granddaughter's birthday. Aside from hellish service and customer service representatives on UAL DEN-LAX flight (see earlier review) this one about took the cake. When I went to check in at Hilo Hawaiian told me that had no reservation for me. They said that they sent some kind of message to me earlier. I have all my email and text messages for weeks before the flight and there was no contact. Eventually the only way to make the flight was to buy an upgraded ticket (from $177 to $303). Needless to say I'll never ever fly with Hawaiian Airlines again.

Trip Brisbane to Honolulu return - Economy class. My wife and I flew Hawaiian Airlines as they offer a direct flight from Brisbane. We flew in a Boeing 767 and found there seemed to be more leg room than some of the more recent aircraft. Service was good both ways.

### Hawaiian Airlines customer review
Flew Sydney to Honolulu then Honolulu to Las Vegas and back to Honolulu on A330 overall flights were good especially the international legs but the seats on the 330 are far too hard. The flight attendants were very good we then flew Honolulu to Brisbane on old 767 but actually this aircraft was very comfortable and would be my preference over the 330 every time.

### Hawaiian Airlines customer review
I flew to Honolulu from Sydney returning to Brisbane last week and was impressed with the onboard service. I was connecting from a internal flight to a Hawaiian Air flight and had a great welcome from desk staff which continued in the Air New Zealand Lounge. Great food and drink service with great amenities. On board the A320 the unique Hawaiian welcome on board set the ambience for a great fight. Food and drinks service and care was exceptional. The great experience with Hawaiian Air resumed on my return flight on a 767 to Brisbane. The friendly welcome from Hawaiian ground staff at the curb side at the Honolulu terminal until I got on board was terrific. My only disappointment was the Hawaiian Premier Lounge need to look at their code share airlines Virgin or Air NZ for a better standard. I felt I had the privilege of spending a further 10 hrs in Hawaii surrounded by the friendliness of Hawaiian culture. Good one Hawaiian Air ... I'll be back!

### Hawaiian Airlines customer review
Las Vegas to Honolulu round trip in first class. This was our first experience in first class and we were very pleased. Immediate friendly service before leaving Las Vegas. Very good food and plenty to drink. On the trip back the entertainment screen failed and a flight attendant dead heading back to Las Vegas helped me get it working. Again very good and friendly service from the crew. As this was our first time in first class I can't compare seats to other airlines or plane models; but our seats were very comfortable on the A 330. If we can afford it we would definitely do this again.

### Hawaiian Airlines customer review
Hawaiian is usually very good at customer service once you are on the plane but the process to get a seat or an upgrade is the worst that I have experienced in the 17 years that I have traveled for business. As a Platinum member I have vouchers for a complimentary upgrade to first class on flights from the mainland to Oahu. I am now on my 3rd year of travel to Hawaii and I have not been upgraded once. The process requires that you wait until 72 hours before the flight before they will consider an upgrade but most of the time First Class is sold out by that time. Even if it isn't sold out they will not allow any upgrades until the last minute in hopes of generating more revenue. The fact that they offer First Class to their Elite customers then put processes in place that makes it impossible to use it says that they really don't have anyone with any customer elations skills working at the corporate office. I fly to Hawaii 6 or 7 times a year and I would rather they didn't send me any type of upgrade certificate as a teaser if they are never going to let me use it.

### Hawaiian Airlines customer review
Our first trip (OGG-SEA) on the new A330 with Hawaiian. We like the wide-body aircraft because when the two of us travel we can get a window and an aisle seat together. The seats on this plane are the most uncomfortable seats I have ever sat in! The setback "entertainment" system is very slow and hard to navigate because one has to push hard on the screen for inputs to be recognized. I was afraid to push hard enough because it must have been annoying to the person in front of me. We had to miss the outbound SEA-OGG segment of this flight because of a change to our plans. I knew that we would not get anything back for that flight that we did not take but when we called HA to tell them that we would miss it they tried to collect $400 from us for change fees for the segment that we intended to keep. It has been our experience that the call center at HA is terrible and this was no exception. After 3 hours and no call we just went to the OGG airport where we were told that there was no change fee applicable.

Flew Beijing to Honolulu March 2014 in "Business Class. Definitely closer to economy plus. Uncomfortable barely reclining seats no electronics charging in-flight entertainment consists of iPads with a few games and movies/TV shows. Food was okay flight attendants brusque but efficient. They definitely don't seem like they enjoy their jobs. Would look hard for other options next time especially with Air China starting to fly that route.

AKL/HNL + Maui and back. Flight up ok apart from seating at rear of cabin (we had paid for this trip in March). Poor food and expensive inflight entertainment. Maui to HNL my wife and I were seated in separate areas of the cabin! HNL to AKL seated even further apart. Seating arrangements Maui/HNL sorted by very helpful passenger service agent. Seating arrangement HNL/AKL sorted by paying additional $US75 each. Never again. Note we had booked and paid for this trip 6 months before flying.

### Hawaiian Airlines customer review
Worst business class I have experienced. We flew from Sydney-Honolulu and Honolulu-Oakland and were shocked. The seats were terrible reclining just a little bit more than those in economy class and the food options for vegetarians were non-existent. We had informed them that we are vegetarian well in advance but when we reached the airport we were told that they don't have special meals for anyone even in business class so we'll have to make do with whatever they had. The lounge in Honolulu is shocking - no food just some juice and soft drinks. If you do have to fly Hawaiian do yourself a favor and save yourself a lot of money by flying economy - business class adds nothing.

### Hawaiian Airlines customer review
AKL-HNL-LAX on 13 Feb Business class: the AKL-HNL leg was on an A330 so the seats were very uncomfortable for a fairly long flight. The inflight entertainment was very basic. The staff seemed alright: even though they seemed to be very focused on 3 specific guests with whom they have been talking most of the time they were friendly and they did their job. The service is very casual anyway. HNL-LAX was on a newer plane: seats were bigger but not really reclining more of an easy chair than else. The inflight entertainment was via iPads as there were only communal screens. The chicken salad was really strange: the chicken was OK but it got served with some very gooey steamed rice and 2 (as in two) very hard strips of carrot. The lounge in HNL was a joke: the only refreshments offered were orange juice coffee and soft drinks from a dispenser eventually I was able to find some dry snacks by the reception counter (instead than at the 'bar'). The decor is very shabby. The only good thing was the wifi.

We flew over to Honolulu on 8th January 2014 and was most uncomfortable flight I have been on. The flight entertainment was atrocious and we were told the entertainment was no longer available which I call false advertisement as they still claim the tablets are available. We are dreading the flight back to Sydney and will not be travelling with Hawaiian Airlines again. The airfares were not cheap either. Big mistake on our part.

Went from New Zealand to Honolulu to JFK Return. Chose Hawaiian for the price. The staff seemed to be keen to help in the first 2 hours. Then it seemed that they were sleeping as it was hard to get service. My husband is blind and this was noted when booking but the staff were not very understanding compared to other airlines we have flown. Food marginal.

### Hawaiian Airlines customer review
I fly monthly on Hawaiian and January is always a surprising month as they change services for the new year. This time HNL-PDX I flew coach exit row. No meal upgrade available like in 2013. Instead their complementary meal was a soggy bready carbohydrate laden terrible mess. It's as if Hawaiian said: let's do this on the cheap so we can say "we're the only airline to offer complimentary meals from mainland to Hawaii". I get PR but what I was served was like a slap in the customers face it was so horrible. I would pay the $15 for a more appetizing meal. The crew was as always excellent.

San Diego - HNL - Hilo. Good service very welcoming staff small portions of food but good breakfast consisted of fruit crackers and cheese and macadamia chocolate. Later we were served a cocktail and chips which was lovely. Most entertainment has to be paid for and I think so has the earphones but I had my own entertainment. My one bugbear the recline of the seats are ridiculous with the travellers in front nearly on your knee more so than on any other airline I've flown with. Luckily they were very strict at meal times for seats to be upright. All in all a pleasant experience.

HA451 13/12/13 business class seat 1G. On time boarding and departure and thankfully business class before children this time. As usual I was treated as a VIP due to my platinum status. Once onboard the business class cabin staff were outstanding they introduced themselves by name and learnt the customers names. The smiling faces of the 3 business class flight attendants was great - nothing was a bother for them. The food as usual on Hawaiian were great fish and veal with a very nice sweet for dessert plus dessert wines and liquors drinks flowed the whole way to Honolulu. After a sleep in the comfy armchair recliners style seats a big healthy breakfast was served about an hour out of Honolulu. One and only complaint this is an ongoing issue all of the bags marked first class priority were last off this problem always happens at Honolulu and in Sydney. Otherwise as usual great service and a highly professional team that needs acknowledged.

### Hawaiian Airlines customer review
My flight from JFK to LAX was 20 min late including the time it took to retrieve my luggage at baggage claim. The flight I had just arrived on was located right next to the gate I was to leave from to catch my Hawaii flight. When I got to the Hawaiian ticket counter to check my bag in for the flight I still had 40 minutes remaining before my flight would leave for Hawaii. To my surprise no one was there at the check in counter. I explained that I had a flight to Hawaii that leaves in 40 minutes and I asked to speak with a manager or supervisor to assist me. The only response they gave me was to go to the information booth which was downstairs and turned their backs on me and said “There is nothing they could do!”I went downstairs dragging my heavy luggage to ask for help at the information desk was told to call Hawaiian Airlines. I went back upstairs and there was a representative there. I explained my situation stating there was no one to check me in. I was told: There is nothing that he could do and the next flight is tomorrow! I was stranded and had nowhere to turn to at the time. I was offered no assistance at LAX airport. I ended up paying for the ticket having to change my return ticket because of their policies. Then they informed me about a reduction fee policy after I already paid an extra $200! Hawaiian Airlines computer system appears inefficient outdated and extremely slow. I will never fly Hawaiian Airlines again!

Flight from Sydney to Hawaii was fantastic the service could not have been better. Staff were very friendly and helpful the children had plenty of entertainment and the adults had plenty to watch all free. The leg from Hawaii to LAX was not what we had experienced in the first leg of the trip. The plane was freezing so I asked for a blanket and it was going to cost me $10us dollars. You also had to pay for the entertainment we had just flown from Australia and they wanted more money. We were not happy same again on the LAX to Hawaii - freezing but the leg from Hawaii to Australia very comfortable.

### Hawaiian Airlines customer review
A couple of weeks back we had to cut short our trip due to a family members health deteriorating rapidly we were in Kauai and needed to get back to Sydney pronto. Hawaiian were accommodating on getting us on a flight but charged us both for entirely 2 new one way air fares ( AUD2200) - talk about slugging you whilst you are down - absolutely no compassion at all. Other family member were in the UK and Emirates/Qantas did all they could to get them home in time which they did and did all of this free of charge - we've flown with Hawaiian in the past but this has left a very very poor taste in our collective mouths. IF we can at all help it will not be flying Hawaiian again.

We flew for the first time with Hawaiian airlines from Brisbane on 767 to Hawaii then onto Vegas. We upgraded to business class on flight from Brisbane to Hawaii the night before on online check in for discounted price - worth it. Lounge at Brisbane airport is AirNZ and was great.

### Hawaiian Airlines customer review
Most uncomfortable seats on any flight I've ever experienced. Very cold on the flight no blankets or pillows offered on this OAK-OGG flight. Meal is a joke! Brunch consisted of 2 small slices of cantaloupe 2 small slices of mushy watermelon 2 very hard slices of unripe honeydew melon 4 grapes 4 crackers one piece of cheese and one chocolate covered macadamia nut candy. When leaving home at 6:00 a.m. with two hour advance check-in before a 5:33 flight don't assume Hawaiian is offering a meal as their advertising reports; eat first take food on the plane. Take a jacket to wear on the flight. Very tight leg room uncomfortable uncushioned hard seats. They are the only airline that I know of that charges for ear phones. Could have brought my own if I knew they are not included. Poor quality entertainment choices. If you want to starve freeze and suffer through a long flight fly HA otherwise choose a different carrier.

BNE-HNL return Business although not fully flat the recliner seats are very comfy food and beverages excellent as well as the staff.

I flew HA436 first class from SYD to HNL on 12th October on a brand new A330 and had a very good experience - attentive crew - great food preparation and meal and beverage service and good in-flight entertainment. The only drawback was the lack of a lie flat bed for a 9 hour flight-the seat was comfortable but if HA pulled out those cradle type seats in First and removed the economy seats in the second smaller cabin and installed lie flat beds in both cabins they would have a great product and sweep away their competition.

Hilo to Sydney via Honolulu. Web check in went well purchased preferred seats for Honolulu to Sydney cost $75 seat 14B. Hilo to Honolulu HA 121 8.50am departure seat 1B first class. Lounge at Hilo very basic free wifi coffee and soft drink. Pre boarding done correctly on time departure quick 50 minute flight just enough time for a coffee and a biscuit. Honolulu to Sydney HA 451 seat 14B the reserved seating bulk head seat cost $75 extra. Boarding called in correct order except kids get priority again. My bulk head seat was as spacious as an economy seat can be. I would have preferred the seats in row 11 but they were blocked for the entire 24 hour period during check in. Not long after take off a very friendly stewardess offered drinks and 2 hours into flights refills and dinner served would give this food a 4 out of 5 for economy. There was a lot of young families traveling with babies all were reasonably behaved for a 10 hour flight. There of course was one family who thought it was ok for their children to play a portable DVD player without head phones so all the cabin could hear it.

5th October SYD-HNL-ITO. This is my 10th year as a dedicated Hawaiian air traveller for long distance trip SYD to HNL and Hilo also to LA and Vegas also started to use their HNL to JFK this year and looking forward to their expansion with new aircraft purchase planned. Today's trip started on 4th October at 2000 when I attempted to use the web check in 24 hours prior with no success. I am lucky I am a gold Pualani member so I called their dedicated line after about 25 minutes they were able to upgrade my SYD-HNL flight and my HNL-Hilo which is good as business on Hawaiian is normally very good. 5th October check in was a breeze with the dedicated business and Pualani member line and with express pass through immigration I was In the Air New Zealand lounge in no time. This Air NZ lounge has improved over the past few years it was getting tired and food mediocre. But gladly today much better I really like the self help bar. My flight is scheduled for 2000 departure I noticed in bound flight arrived on time. Boarding started on time and again children first before business - this always annoys me. Once onboard was offered welcome champagne or juice the seats are wide leather seats but don't lie flat but are still very comfortable and they have power for your iPad or iPhone. Take off on time and as soon as we levelled off drinks started to flow I had a few chivas regals and before dinner there also was a cheese plate. 3 options for dinner I had the veal and catch of the day and it was fantastic. Breakfast was strawberry yoghurt fresh fruit plate country style potatoes and crab and scallion omelette also fantastic. The cabin crew were very attentive and professional I managed to get a good couple of hours sleep and rested for my next flight HNL to Hilo. Got through customs fairly fast but maybe they could looking into express path for business passengers like in Sydney. At the transfer desk no Hawaiian staff there to send my bags to Hilo so had to take them to the inter island terminal myself. Once there was easy to drop off bags and head to the priority security line. Honolulu to Hilo again seat 1B a quick 50 minute flight no problems arrived on time and bags were quickly available. Over all a 5 star trip very pleased and look forward to many more Hawaiian trips.

San Francisco-Honolulu-San Francisco in September 2013. Outbound Flight HA11 boarded on time boarding was organized flight left and arrived on time. Newish Airbus A330-200's economy cabin was stylish and comfortable. Basic IFE offered little entertainment you have to pay extra for movies and TV programs. Not a problem for me and my wife as we brought our own respective iPads. The outbound basic "free" meal consisted of a fruit tray a cookie a Hawaiian chocolate candy in a wrapper water and juice or soda. Upgraded meal was $14 for a hamburger or a Chicken salad with a few extras on the meal tray but we felt those were not good values for their prices therefore we bought two sandwiches in the airport before our flight. Flight attendants were pleasant and they offered free Mai Tais and Hawaiian chips about one hour before landing in HNL. Total of three drink runs during the 5 1/2-hour flight. Return flight HA12 also with organized boarding left and arrived on time. Nothing new to say about the Airbus A330-200's IFE except this particular airplane's moving map display has an added information on the airplane's flight level in meters and feet. Surprised we were given "free" in-flight meal of Chicken- stuffed hot sandwich with a small salad and Hawaiian chocolate candy a free cup of wine was an option! This was very much appreciated. Again three drink runs during this 4 1/2-hour flight. Flight attendants were pleasant and efficient. With HA's convenient departure and arrival times and newer Airbus A330-200 aircraft's used on the SFO- HNL-SFO routes we will fly with them again next time we visit the Hawaiian Islands.

Flew Business Class Sydney to Honolulu. Complete rip off. Seats do not convert to beds the plane was old and outdated the food was terrible and they don't even have a wine list. For a snack we were not offered but had to ask and it was a bag of chips or a cookie in Business Class. Uniforms are as ugly as the plane and the service was shocking. I will never fly on Hawaiian again.

### Hawaiian Airlines customer review
SYD-HNL. My mother and I had high hopes. We were quite disappointed starting from the moment we entered the plane. Cabin Crew appeared disinterested and not polite. The food was by far the most terrible we have ever had on any flight. It was quite safe to say that Hawaiian Airlines food service onboard HA452 and HA451 was disgusting. On both legs no vegetarian option was given and we were given hard cold chicken with undercooked vegetables. It was a terrible way to start a flight and it certainly did not get any better as the long night flight became unusually extremely cold to the point that others were questioning it too! The cabin temperature served countless chills that made it hard to sleep.

### Hawaiian Airlines customer review
SFO to HNL (7 Sep) HNL to/from Lihue (09/10 Sep) and final sector on HA445 to Auckland (13 Sep). Per my previous post this airline could be good. Pluses: new A330 aircraft flights on time decent 2 piece 70 lb baggage allowance for international pax the crew on the final four sectors were much more enthusiastic in serving their passengers (HA445 in particular) the web check-in and bag drop at all airports worked well. The pluses end there. Minuses: For international passengers the food/beverage and inflight entertainment is dire. Can see why US passengers might rate them highly given what they endure domestically! What's with the bland chicken and rice dishes on all lunch and dinner flights? The free F+B offering on SFO-HNL breakfast run consists of 4 grapes 4 slices of melon a piece of cheese and 2 packs of crackers? HA should charge a couple of bucks more and get serious with their offerings or drop the pretence of food completely and charge for a decent offering. The 'complimentary IFE' is a joke in content despite the new A330 planes even the pay per view movies (US$7.99 a pop) were exceedingly limited in choice. The HA terminal in HNL and terminal in LIH are in a time warp but suspect this to be the fault of the airport authorities (and TSA is certainly outside HA's control). Like I said all's not lost this airline certainly is no 4/5 star airline but it could be halfway decent with a few weeks. For the price paid not really good value. A shame as actually had been looking forward to flying them to and from SFO. Could only recommend HA only if price substantially cheaper than other options.

I flew from Oakland to Maui on Sep 11. I arrived at the airport at 6am 2 hours before departure. Check-in was a breeze with friendly staff despite the early time of the day. The fee to check in a 45-lb suitcase was $25 (quite standard nowadays). I have flown on many Boeing 767's and this one was by far the quietest one ever. Flight attendants were very friendly. The complimentary breakfast after take-off and the complimentary rum punch before landing are a really nice touch when flying in the economy cabin. I can only think of two draw-backs: 1) your regular head-sets don't work well (you need a two-prong plug or you only hear their [free] video entertainment out of one ear]) and 2) the cabin is very cold (I was prepared and wore my coat but several folks around me were sneezing). Overall: a very good experience!

I have flown Hawaiian Airlines about 20 times now Oakland to either Hilo or Kona last trip was March 2013. As far as I'm concerned there is no other like it. I wish they flew all over the Continental US. Fantastic service on the ground and in the plane. If flights were more than half off with other airlines I wouldn't go I'm staying with Hawaiian.

### Hawaiian Airlines customer review
Travelled AKL to SFO via HNL on 24 Aug. HA446/12. Had been warned not to expect much and this was sage advice. Web check-in and bag drop was a good start for a 23.55 hr departure. Crew on HA446 distinctly lacking aloha. HA12 better. Meals the same bland poached chicken bits on rice with broccoli (ex AKL) and diced carrots/peas (exHNL). Not worth staying up for esp when served at 2 am out of AKL! Breakfast was a plastic bag of assorted industrial foods handed to pax. Inflight entertainment despite being touchscreen on newish A330 was lacking content and not free (US$7.99 a movie). Budget airline without the budget ticket prices in future its back to Air NZ. Pluses: I arrived SFO on time and with both checked bags. HA actually has the potential to be a very good airline but needs to think hard about its international offering.

### Hawaiian Airlines customer review
HNL-SFO in first class. I used Hawaiians drive-thru check-in at HNL and was berated by very unfriendly agent because my friend just dropped me off and then left with the car. Her reasoning it is a drive-thru check-in not a drop-off. When I requested a priority tag for my suitcase agent requested a tip for the porter. I gave the porter a tip but still did not get a priority tag. No information given about lounge access had to find lounge on my own. Overall a very chaotic unfriendly check-in process. Lounge at HNL airport very basic staff ok not overly friendly. On board the service was good and so was the food and wine. The seats however have only minimal recline and were not very comfortable in the upright position. Overall ok for a 5 hr flight but longer flights would be a problem. I used miles for my first class flight and got an ok deal. Otherwise not worth the premium.

HA444 from Brisbane to Honolulu on Sunday 4th August. Returning Saturday 17th August on flight HA443. Budget airline would never fly them again.

If you are flying coach w/o elite status Hawaiian Airlines is great because they you are their target market. I have flown Hawaiian many times between Las Vegas and Hawaii most recently just a few days ago. Here is what I like: 1) A decent seat pitch of 32 inches is standard 2) seating on the transpacific planes is 2-4-2 so a husband and wife can get a window aisle seat by themselves 3) nice free meals in coach 4) they actually answer the phone reasonably quickly by airline standards 5) the flight attendants are actually friendly.

LAX to HNL in First bumped onto Hawaiian due to American Airlines flight going tech. Great new Airbus aircraft clean bright and fresh fantastic staff friendly very out going nice pre take off drinks great Menu and Catering Wine choice was very limited and The Seat is terribly uncomfortable but overall I think Hawaiian have a great little niche and are the best of the American Carriers.

### Hawaiian Airlines customer review
HNL-SFO. Self-service check-in quick although not enough personnel to help through the relatively complex system. Bags are weighed and you even self-tag the bags before dropping it off. Potentially efficient but the communication needs to be better. However the extra charges are ridiculous on Hawaiian. Check in per bag at $70 movies at $12 extra legroom seats at $70 again. I know American carriers practice ala carte pricing but Hawaiian's charges are more then other carriers. The so-called trumpeted meal service was a few bland pieces of chicken with rice an aged salad and a piece of chocolate. The final straw however was the crew. While sitting on a bulkhead seat after paying the ridiculous charges passengers were trampling on my feet to get to the other aisle. When I advised the crew they said its not their problem. Bags in SFO took ages mitigating an on-time arrival. Sorry Hawaiian but serving sub-standard complimentary food does not allow you to rip off passengers with extra charges and poor service. Next time I am bringing my own food on-board and flying Delta!

### Hawaiian Airlines customer review
Oakland - Maui - Kona. An excellent experience from start to finish. Great service punctuated by smiles and efficiency. A delicious breakfast was served with a small cheese plate offered before landing. The other carriers on these Hawaiian routes should take notes about first class service and offerings. Easy transfer in Maui to a short efficient hop to Kona.

Returned from Honolulu to Sydney Fri 26th July. Business Class was a shambles checking in. There was no one at the desk and a queue was building. A girl finally appeared and was so slow and uninterested we asked another guy who was assisting economy people get their own baggage labels in a machine and finally he assisted us. Really disappointed after paying so much. A330 seats not very comfortable and my video machine did not work. The staff were very friendly and couldn't fault them but would not fly again with them.

### Hawaiian Airlines customer review
Honolulu-Seattle-Maui First Class. Although somehow skimpier than it was in past years the experience was generally very good. Smiling truly friendly attendants comfortable (767) seating and decent food are the mainstay of Hawaiians First Class mainland service and they delivered. The aircraft is old but very comfortable. Digi players are annoying and clumsy to use but provide a fair amount of entertainment on this particular route. Somehow the meals seemed a little less robust than before but were tasty. All in all at the head of the pack certainly for travel to and from Hawaii and perhaps domestically altogether.

SYD-HNL return. Sydney to Honolulu - Check in staff very efficient. Friends travelling to Honolulu night before and went to service desk to ask about window seats. The man at the desk said that we were currently sitting in the middle of the aircraft and he would try to get us window seats as the flight was full. Arrived at the airport next day to check in and was assigned window seats. Cabin crew were very friendly. All of them smiling. Cabin very clean and comfortable. New A330 aircraft. Pillow and blanket provided. Food was good. Very good portion sizes. Cabin crew regularly came through the cabin offering water to passengers. Other drinks were available from the galley upon request. Range of TV's and movies available to watch. Over movies were available for a fee. Smooth flight. Honolulu to Sydney - Printed out boarding pass previous day and had chosen seats then. This time in the middle of the aircraft. Used self serve kiosks to weigh and print out bag tags. Also printed out new boarding passes. Very efficient process. Again a friendly crew. Meal service was good again. This time sitting in the middle of the aircraft there seemed to be more legroom. Cabin crew kept offering water during the flight. The Pau Hana Snack bar was open during the flight. Staff very friendly and efficient. However 1 cabin crew member did not seem as if she wanted to be there. All other cabin crew were great.

Honolulu-Kona-Honolulu. B717. A real shame. Hawaiian is taking profit of its monopoly. Our United Airlines flight from Tokyo arrived much earlier and therefore we decided to travel immediately to Kona on already booked tickets. A bad humored attendant decided that we should pay US$50 and not US$30 each. We had also to pay for checked-in luggage (US$17) each. As one was 2 pounds over the permission I had to transfer clothes to the hand luggage. Ridiculous. Plus: flight was 90% empty + service was a warn cup of coffee with a soup taste. Note that our return flight was delayed 1hour and a half with no apologizes whatsoever even not from Captain.

My friend and I both took our 9 month old sons to Hawaii. Staff on flight were not helpful at all. We asked if they would wash our bottles for us being our hands are tied with the babies and they pointed to the restrooms. Asked for help with our carry on we were actually turned away. Both going and back the flight and staff were not accommodating to us fellow passengers were more of a help.

Hilo to Sydney via Honolulu 10th June. Hilo check in was quick bags booked all the way to Sydney. I still get the lounge due to gold status. Hilo to Honolulu seat 7b 8.50am flight left on time pleasant crew. At Honolulu lounge access again basic wifi coffee soft drinks. No food or snacks available and lounge is a long walk from international gates. Honolulu to Sydney business HA451 seat 1H. Boarding procedures were business and wheelchairs first as it should be then children and pualani gold and platinum. Plane left on time clean and new airbus welcoming crew. After take off spicy crab sushi with pickled ginger and cocktails 45 minutes after take off. Dinner was salmon in rice paper Himalayan rice with macadamia nut pesto and salad - very impressed. Desert was Ice cream truffle strawberry sorbet. Cocktails constant and staff attentive. Before arrival a Hawaiian style high tea was served. Arrival as usual. Due to the airbus only utilizes one door business must walk back through economy to get off so not first off the plane but we are given priority customs forms to fast track forms through customs and immigration. Bags are tagged first class priority and come through very quick. My only complaint is Sydney airport customs they give you an express path ticket when in business and first and that line was huge at Sydney. Overall a great flight and always recommend Hawaiian to all USA destinations.

Flight HA17 Las Vegas to Honolulu 1 June 13 1.55am red eye. Disappointed no Hawaiian lounge for members at Las Vegas airport security was fast. Seat 14d bulkhead seat at $25 extra is worth it. Boarding was chaos people had to fight to the front to get in as a Pualani gold member. At Las Vegas they do boarding differently wheelchairs first children then first followed by platinum then gold. Once on board I had an annoying kid kicking my seat continually parents not stopping it until I said something. After take off I settled into a nice sleep lights all turned down for people to rest. Drinks were served and free soft drinks and coffee towards landing. Arrival in Honolulu was on time and deplaned 4.45am. Crew friendly and attentive not much involvement as it was an over night flight.

### Hawaiian Airlines customer review
Las Vegas - HNL on a 767-300. Staff on the flight were very good with plenty of genuine smiles and offers of assistance. Food and drink offerings were as expected as most options are at a cost. I paid for a digi player and it was ok to pass the time on this 6+ hr sector and found it ok but the selections were a bit limited and in most cases fairly out of date which was disappointing. The real downside was the fact that blankets are not offered and must be bought which would be ok but they hold a very small stock which sold quickly and the cabin was freezing. Fine for the staff who had jackets to wear but for a plane load of people leaving one hot destination for another this isn't good as most people were in shorts and t-shirts.

Hilo to HNL 26 May 13 HA 311 Seats 6A. Check-in early and easy in Hilo booked all the way to Vegas. Very basic lounge in Hilo for 1st class and premier club members. Flight on time free juice or water available on 50 minute flight. HNL to Las Vegas HA 8 Seat 29B. Take off on time very packed flight. Cocktail hour started not long after take off and I was informed that Pualani Gold no longer get 2 free cocktails a little disappointing for a 5 hour flight. Pillows and blankets were ok for Economy. Staff appeared to be nice friendly and relaxed they were always walking around to make sure everyone had what they wanted - no request went unanswered. Flight delayed 45 minutes dues to head winds.

SYD-HNL HA 436 20.00 flight depart SYD on time Seat 1B. USB power available. Check-in smooth friendly and personal as you would expect for a Pualani Gold Member. Air New Zealand lounge for drinks and snacks a little over crowded. In bound plane arrived on time. Boarding is always a push and shove in Sydney and they start with children which annoys me Business or First should go first. After being seated champagne was nice but rushed. Only 9 people in business and 3 flight attendants so good service. After take off hot towels and customs forms handed out. Tables set for cheese biscuits and cocktails served. Staff friendly and professional. Dinner served less than 1 hour into the flight. I had steak and pumpkin ravioli and it was very nice. Lights turned down and window shades closed. Bathroom nice laid out with amenities. Sleep as always is hard for me the seats are not lie flat but are still comfortable leather recliners. Breakfast served an hour out of Honolulu. In Honolulu only had 1 hour 15 minutes to make it through customs and my next flight I made it through customs in 15 mins. Overall a great flight and what I have come to expect from Hawaiian business class.

KOA-OGG-LIH-HNL. We made 3 inter island flights with Hawaiian on our vacation (3 persons). Flights were almost on time. Staff helpful and friendly. Only a drink service (fruit juice) on the short flights (30min). Planes (B717) clean and with a special "Hawaiian fragrance" in the cabin. Good value for the money.

Arrive at Kennedy for a flight going from New York to Oahu. Only then do we find luggage is $25 a bag more. We were going to see my son in the Marines stationed at Oahu. I tried to see if I could get my veteran's discount and was declined. I later asked if active military would be able to get a discount. I was told they used to do it but stopped. On our tickets it said lunch and supper. However supper turned out just to be a snack (crackers and cheese). No complimentary movie even though the flight is 11 hours long. The straw that broke the camel's back was the return trip. My son wanted to see us off. As active military almost every airline will give him a gate pass to see us off. He showed his ID and security instructed us to get to the counter and get a pass for him. We had to wait in a rebagging line a half hour. When we finally got to the counter I stated that we needed to get a pass for him. The woman said "Passes are only for the handicapped and seniors. At that point I flipped she issued him a pass and told me the I have to understand this is for security reasons. Never again.

My husband and I flew to Honolulu stayed for 6 days then flew on to San Francisco. From being able to check-in online choose or change our seats online to the overall appearance of the plane to the staff etc it was a great experience. I am vegetarian and they do not cater specifically for us so took some food on board. Our seats were good not quite as much leg room as other airlines but sufficient. Baggage allowance was fantastic. Left and arrived on time. Coming back from SF to NZ was a different story. We had extra luggage so we did a manual check in there were issues with the computer system as it was new. Staff were great. Boarded on time then the Captain announced there were problems after 2 hours on the tarmac we disembarked. Captain kept us well informed. Missed our connecting flights. Once again the staff were great. They re-booked all of us gave us generous food vouchers organised free trolleys for our luggage and had them waiting for us when we went to collect our luggage. A pretty good experience and we would recommend them.

Sydney to LA LA to Las Vegas Las Vegas to Hawaii and due to fly back to Sydney tomorrow. We have had nothing but problems. We have a 1 year old and do not expect special treatment however I do expect a level of service which should come with paying the fare. We have to pay $75 extra for a bulk head seat however for all 4 flights have been unable to do this due to a technical problem which they tell us has something to do with travelling with an infant however can't tell us how to overcome this. The majority of the hostesses are rude and not helpful at all. We received no information from them in regards to seatbelt safety etc when it came to our daughter and had to ask. The last thing as a parent you want to do is inconvenience other passengers however they make flying with a child horrific as once again we are unable to book and pay for the bulk head seats through web check in. They had the cheek to tell us that the only way they could help us was for on our last day to catch a cab to the airport and check in that way. We told them it would cost us 130 dollars round trip and we couldn't with our one year old and they couldn't care less. They are a disgrace. I will never ever fly them again and if you are thinking of booking your holiday with them don't.

SYD-HNL in April. Pretty ordinary service sarcastic staff member and were inattentive. When we needed extra blankets for all of us 2 adults and a child the crew member said they never have enough blankets and I had to go and find someone. He was uninterested and wasn't going to even look for one. My husband found a couple as the cabin was absolutely freezing. The flight was not full so having extra seats were good but the food was really ordinary too. One meal was OK but not great. Movies at a cost. We paid a good price for the ticket so was very disappointing.

### Hawaiian Airlines customer review
My wife and I got married on Kauai and honeymooned on Maui. Flew Hawaiian Airlines the entire way. On the return we inquired about changing our flight so we would not have a 3-hour layover in Honolulu. The woman at the counter informed us there may be a small fee. 20 minutes later she informed us it would cost $650 per person to change our flight. She was attempting to sell us new tickets at day-of prices and subtracting what we had already paid for our current tickets. She handed us back our ticket vouchers with "OC" written on them. It seems she unblocked our hand picked seats we reserved 6 months ago in order to investigate changing our tickets. The "OC" stands for overcharge and we no longer had seats on the flight from Honolulu to Portland. This was a 6 hour flight and comfortable seats were important. Got off the plane in Honolulu. Told we needed to speak to the ticket agent at the departing gate. He did find us seats on the flight but they were at the back. Supervisor eventually gave us emergency exit row seats. The real shame is Hawaiian used to be better than the other airlines but now they nickle and dime you with hidden costs just like all the rest.

HNL to INC. Flight was not full so there were empty seats. Plane was a very old 767 that was showing its age. Run down and torn seats my table tray still had crumbs and gravy stains and my seat volume control was broken as was the overhead monitor screens. Cabin staff treated passengers like cattle. The only smiles I saw from the flight attendants were when they tandem delivered drinks and meals joking loudly with each other as if the passengers didn't matter. During the noodle service the 2 male flight attendants were in such a rush that they shoved the noodle cup in our laps even though some passengers didn't have their tray down. The service did resemble the price I paid. On the upside the meal was tasty and plentiful and the trip back from Fukuoka to HNL was completely opposite.

### Hawaiian Airlines customer review
Flew Hawaiian for the first time from San Francisco to Honolulu in coach with some trepidation given previous reviews. On checking in online exit row seats (window/aisle) in a 2-4-2 layout were available at 35 bucks each. Well worth the money especially as priority boarding was thrown in to the price. Bag drop was slow but bags helpfully tagged through to Molokai. Well organised boarding on a completely full flight plus the priority boarding meant that overhead bin space wasn't an issue (though it was for others who boarded later). An on time departure and a very thorough briefing on our role at the emergency exit set a positive tone for the flight. A "continental breakfast" (but more like a snack box) with a sweet roll with cream cheese savoury snack bag and a cookie plus T&Cs and juice was served promptly. A second round of T&Cs and a later water run were offered and unexpected. An hour or so out of Honolulu a further drinks run with T&Cs and complimentary mai tai were offered concluding a cabin service which was good and delivered by friendly and professional crew. All in all - cheaper than other N American carriers by a fair amount with a good level of service I wasn't expecting.

Short OGG-KOA island hop flight in a Boeing 717. Chose HA over others since preferred to be in a jet rather than smaller turboprop. Rather chaotic check-in process but that could be the fault of the airport and once past that it was all good. We had aisle and window seats with one person in between us. Didn't feel cramped. We had tried to upgrade to first the day before (you can to it at a reduced charge 24 hours in advance) but fc seats already filled. No matter. Didn't see that much of a difference. And for such a short flight economy was just fine.

My husband and I flew HA Brisbane to Honolulu Business Class Flight 444 6 Feb 2013. Boeing 767. The cost was Return $7483 Aus. The plane had the oldest most uncomfortable seats I have ever been on. The only good thing about the flight was it was direct Brisbane to Honolulu. I was seated in Seat 2b. The flight on the way home was a newer Boeing 767. I was seated in 1A and it was better. Hawaiian Airlines should not say these are Business Class Seats. Service on the way to Honolulu left much to be desired. It was better on the way Home to Brisbane.

I wasn't expecting much because my ticket from Honolulu to LA was only $172! After flying from Auckland to Honolulu and receiving nothing but water I was bowled over when we were given a complimentary snack box beverages and even a complimentary mai-tai. The entertainment required a 10 dollar fee and since I did not have my own headset an additional 3 dollars bought a headset. The attendants were lukewarm.

LAS-HNL-ITO. It is amazing how things change over 12 months. At LAS there are too few check-in staff. Bag drop amazingly can take 30 minutes. So much for on-line check-in and printing boarding passes. On board they still have A330s with seat back screens but that is about all. The choice of viewing available without payment is pathetic. There is no longer even a snack provided for what is quite a long flight instead they want you to buy dismal snacks from the back galley. There is the walk between terminals at HNL and then a fair short flight to Hawaii. Coming back we paid for first class on the short flight. That was good. Bags flew free and Mai Tais are available. The main flight? Dire. No food screens keep trying to get money. I am through with HA. There is no difference now between HA and other carriers I will just use the best schedule at the best price.

BNE-HNL-SEA. Check-in at BNE was easily the slowest I have experienced anywhere - terrible. The check-in staff at BNE are obviously local contractors who couldn't even tell me if I needed to change terminals at Honolulu ! Very poor directions from ground staff at HNL as to how to get to domestic flight. Aircraft was clean comfortable and seat space seemed quite OK. Staff on board are excellent and very friendly. Ground staff need a good shaking up. Meals only so-so. Lousy in-flight entertainment I simply didn't bother. I would fly again if they could trim their prices a bit but if cabin staff should ever fail me I wouldn't be back.

JFK-HNL-JHM-HNL-JFK. Excellent trip in all respects. JFK-HNL leg was on a new A330. Economy seats are 32" pitch more than most US carriers. That extra inch makes a difference on a 10-11 hour flight. Two free meals were served by hard-working and attentive staff along with several drink services. Yes the first bag cost $35 but Hawaiian checked it through from JFK to West Maui even though that flight was on Island Air and I never touched the luggage until I reached my final destination. I enjoyed these flights so much that I have already reserved another JFK-HNL-KOA-HNL-JFK trip for this coming July. Since I booked so early I was able to snag row 13 which is in the small quiet section behind Business Class.

My wife and I flew BNE-HNL-BNE 767 just prior to Christmas and returned early January 2013. Flights were on time and staff efficient and helpful. The service side is a let down they say we are a full service airline but there is no choice with meals and very limited drinks service. The seats are reasonable for someone my size 6ft 2 but I would like better entertainment than a digiplayer. If we were planning on returning to Honolulu I would think about upgrading to business.

SYD-HNL-OGG-HNL-SYD in December 2012. A330-200 between Sydney and Honolulu and B717 between Honolulu and Maui. All flights on time. On A330 I would advise taking the $75 upgrade to a bulkhead seat - particularly row 11 as its right behind Business class and in a mini cabin of only 3 rows. If travelling overnight I'd pay for economy and upgrade on check-in online to Business if available. Best thing about the flights was the excellent service and the prompt appearance of baggage at the carousel. Food was good drinks plentiful. Pay TV option was a bit much but we read. I joined their FF program before I booked - for only $120 it was worth it! Business check-in express pass through customs lounge access it's kind of like the Qantas Club. You also get priority boarding which was very useful. Hawaiian's aircraft on the Sydney to Honolulu route are all brand new A330s.

OAK-OGG-KOA KOA-OGG-SJC. This was my first experience on Hawaiian and it may very well be my last. On the Maui-San Jose flight Hawaiian screened a movie featuring graphic violence on the big screen in front of a crowd that included numerous young children. Hawaiian cancelled our flight rebooked us with a ridiculous routing involving two plane changes and neglected to inform us. I only discovered this when I went on-line to check the flight time. In the process of shifting our itinerary Hawaiian messed up the seat assignments and split up our family. Correcting these mistakes cost me considerable time.

### Hawaiian Airlines customer review
Easily the most uncomfortable flight I have taken in the last 40 years. Seat pitch is so tight I was just barely able to hold the inflight magazine between my chest and the seatback in front of me and I am not oversized. Fortunately they are usually on time the crews are pleasant enough and bags are delivered quickly. Would never fly this carrier again if there were another way to get from HNL to the other islands. Their seating brings new meaning to the phrase cattle car.

### Hawaiian Airlines customer review
Flight from Seattle to Honolulu in an old Boeing 767 which was 26 years old. Crew was nice but service was normal. Seats were broken and legroom was ok lavatories showed their age and had a bad smell. Free food service that is not normal on us-carriers. Food was enough and the quality was fair. Took some time in Honolulu until we reached the gate almost 20 minutes after landing.

### Hawaiian Airlines customer review
Flight from Honolulu to Maui and return. Flight was on an B717 which is a nice plane. Crew was very friendly and had a smile. Seating was better than on older 767. Juice was served shortly after take-off. They offered maps with sights of Maui for free. Baggage was soon on belt. Good job for a short flight like this.

### Hawaiian Airlines customer review
Airbus 330 flight from Honolulu to Las Vegas. Aircraft had new AVOD but they charge for movies. Free dinner was served with rice beef and veggies. Crew came around with water and juice during flight. Flight on time and seating in the new aircraft is very good. Check in kiosk did not work so we had to do it with staff together.

### Hawaiian Airlines customer review
Wife and I flew from Las Vegas to Kona Hawaii connecting both ways in Honolulu. The LAS-HON leg is on an Airbus with 2+4+2 seating in economy so my wife and I can sit together. Hawaiian doesn't jam the seats in economy together as much as some airlines. And for an extra $35 per passenger each way you can get a bulkhead or exit row seat with tons of legroom but to get this you have to do online check-in pretty darn close to 24 hours before your flight. You can actually call the airline and talk to a customer representative without waiting more than a few minutes. If you fly in the evening you get a free tasty although small real hot meal with veggies and meat salad and dessert. (The breakfast service is also free but not as nice as the dinner.) Also when I asked about wine the steward mentioned the half bottle (375 ml) of red as having pleased other passengers so my wife and I bought it for $16 and it was a nice pinot noir.

### Hawaiian Airlines customer review
Arrived at Kona airport with Hawaiian taking us to connect on Oahu with united to California. Had first class tickets upgraded with United points. They tried to charge us for all our bags even though our ticket clearly stated our luggage was free. We asked for a supervisor who still refused to do anything. Finally agree but had delayed us so long we missed our flight. To add insult to injury they stuck us in economy on the next flight. Interesting to see they do not honor United premier or upgrades. Pretty unhappy with desk service!

### Hawaiian Airlines customer review
LAX-HNL HNL-SFO in A330s. The planes were new and clean. Soft drinks and tea/coffee are free. You also get a free meal (poor to fair quality) with a free wine to accompany it. They nickel and dime you for everything else (baggage IFE (films etc.) preferred seating). Cabin crew was efficient but not overly friendly on the outbound flight and on the return flight one member was downright surly. He didn't even look at us when handing us drinks and ignored us when we asked questions. Also took inter-island flights HNL-ITO return in B717s. Good for short flights and you get a free juice or coffee. In summary Hawaiian are good for inter-island but avoid them for long-haul flights.

### Hawaiian Airlines customer review
I hate overnight flights so I booked Business class for the Sydney Hawaii leg in the hope that the extra $1000 would provide a decent night's sleep. Wrong! While the seats do have a footrest and recline more than in economy there was little similarity between Hawaiian and other carriers business class seats Even the pillows were the small and inadequate and the amenities provided were very basic - no cute bag to keep as a souvenir. The cabin crew were excellent and the food served much better than economy but again there is no comparison between it and say the food served in Qantas premium economy. Our flight back to Sydney was back in economy and I was very happy with the experience though the "Hawaiian high tea" served towards the end of the flight was just a roll and a biscuit. Flights on all the sectors I flew were on time and had very professional and helpful cabin crew.

### Hawaiian Airlines customer review
Flew Honolulu to Sydney in Economy. Got exit row seats row 33 with bulkhead in front. Plenty of leg room and no one in front putting their seat back. The only problem was that other people feel it is a through traffic area and use it to cross from one side of the plane to the other. I paid the $75 to have that space for me. I ended up no moving my legs and annoyed some people by doing so. The other thing is the flight attendant was going to move another passenger into the empty seat between myself and a travel friend as the other person was unhappy with her normal economy seat. I complained and reminded her that we had paid $75 for these seats and why should she get a free seat. There were empty rows of seats at the back of the plane that she could have moved her to. I got my way and she was not moved to the exit row seats. Food was good digeplayer was poor. Staff overall were ok. Did not show to much of an effect to make the trip enjoyable. But would fly with them again.

### Hawaiian Airlines customer review
Seattle to Honolulu return in economy. Enhanced meal service with new breakfast box containing bread with cream cheese guava jelly dried fruit and a macadamia nut cookie. Return dinner teriyaki chicken with salad and cake for dessert. All this food plus a free mai tai on the way out and wine with dinner on the return on a domestic USA flight and free to boot? Unheard of nowadays but thank you Hawaiian for still being the only US carrier to offer free food on flights. Cabin crew generally friendly and sharing the aloha spirit. Be nice to the crew and they will be nice back to you. Cant wait for them to bring the A330 to Seattle!

### Hawaiian Airlines customer review
Although I am Pualani Platinum and am generally looked after on Hawaiian I have two upgrade certificates which are virtually useless as my preferred flights are booked out and being able to secure any upgrade from within the allowed window of 7 days to 4 hours of the flight is impossible. I have travelled Business on several occasions between Sydney and Honolulu during 2011-12 and although there has been an introduction of new aircraft of late previous flights have been on old planes with tray tables faulty on two occasions. Seats are also not very comfortable in Business although are better than Economy where space between is very tight especially with tray table down and the seat in front reclined. On 6 September 2012 I did Honolulu-JFK on HA50 at least ending up in a pre-booked window seat in row 13. Overall it was very ordinary if adequate without anything terribly exciting. Arrival at JFK was good in what potentially is a nightmare airport.

### Hawaiian Airlines customer review
Maui-Oakland/SF-Honolulu First Class. As always an extremely good experience due to the friendly staff good food and comfortable seating. Puts the legacy carriers to shame. Maui-Oakland on an older 767 and SF- Honolulu on the new A330. Both aircraft's have their pluses and minuses. Seats on the 767 are actually more comfortable when upright while the entertainment on the 330 is far superior in choices. Meal service is the same and was excellent on both flighst. Staff friendly and welcoming in short everything a cabin crew should be but rarely is these days especially to and from Hawaii.

### Hawaiian Airlines customer review
LAX-HNL-SYD-HNL-JFK. A330-200 on every route. Staff and front desk very helpful. FA's very nice. On flights to mainland you have to pay for IFE. On LAX-HNL leg they served a turkey sandwich and a brownie. Chose to upgrade to the cheeseburger for $12.99. Not a lot of leg room onboard but the seat wasn't too bad. Boarding was slick and organized. On flight to Sydney you were served a meal after takeoff and a light snack before landing-not really enough for a 10 hour flight. You also had to pay for IFE on New York flight which is a long route with no IFE. I would definitely fly Hawaiian if I was going from mainland US to Hawaii and definitely a better experience then when I flew United to Hawaii.

### Hawaiian Airlines customer review
It feels like Hawaiian Airlines is becoming more like Delta and United with their very late flights. I've had my fair share of flights amongst the mentioned airlines. I never thought I'd even be comparing the three airlines. Third time in a row my flight is leaving more than an hour late. This last time Hawaiian boarded us then told us to get off because they needed to refuel. We were told we'd leave in two hours. Five hours later they board us again then tell us they still need to refuel. I forgot to mention they were kind enough to reimburse us with poor head sets.

### Hawaiian Airlines customer review
We flew from Sydney to Las Vegas via Hawaii and return. We decided to treat ourselves to First class both ways which ended up a little disappointing to say the least. The seats did not recline very far (about the same recline as Qantas economy) and the food going over was just plonked in front of us in one hit. At least the staff coming back had a better idea of serving food. I have food allergies (which I notified the airlines of when we booked) and they said they'll see what they can do - all I can say was I was hungry when I arrived except for the food I took with me! Also the inflight entertainment was the same on all four legs so I was wishing I had brought a good book with me. The positives were the staff were friendly drink service was great and they boarded us quickly.

### Hawaiian Airlines customer review
HNL-FUK-HNL on 767. Excellent fare to/from Seoul when connecting in Fukuoka - almost half-price of non- stop. Average experience does not come close to Asiana. No in-seat entertainment no choice of meals and what was served was mediocre cabin attendants disappear for a long time very little communication from pilots. Of four possible aisle seats three have a box underneath that limits foot comfort-choose G to avoid box. In 3-seat middle section I was put with couple and their baby luckily well-behaved but 4 people in 3 seats not acceptable. On-time and smooth connection in Fukuoka to avoid customs. Overall acceptable but cabin service on 9-hour flight not up to standards of airlines based in Asia.

### Hawaiian Airlines customer review
We flew on 2 July 2012 9.20pm flight from Sydney to Honolulu on A330. Plane was half hour late arriving into Sydney which made about 1 hour late departing. Staff food seats were great. We then flew from Honolulu to Big Island on 11 July and returned to Hon on 14 July and then departed Honolulu on 15 July back to Sydney. Good service and friendly staff. 15 July flight home at 12.45pm was again late yet was not Hawaiian's fault. Overall would fly with them again no problem. Food was lovely and plenty of it. Entertainment units were good and purchase of movies if required was easy.

### Hawaiian Airlines customer review
Flew on their new direct flight from Honolulu to New York (JFK) to celebrate the 4th of July. Very impressed with the speed of their boarding flight attendants were friendly and enough storage space. The seats of this Airbus were slightly wider than normal HAL planes so didn't feel like a packed sardine the seat itself slides forward as it reclines and there were folds on the headrest so you wouldn't end up on your neighbor's shoulder; it was quite comfortable to sit for the 10 hour haul. Free soda snack and meals (2) snacks for purchase alcoholic drinks for purchase premium meals for purchase. Surprised that you actually get 2 basic meals for free. Passed out free headsets and there were some video and audio for free but had to pay for others. Everyone has their own video monitor so very cool. USB input available. I kept falling asleep during the meal and drink service and they were very accommodating to bring it for me when I woke up. No regrets and will be returning in 6 months!

### Hawaiian Airlines customer review
Check in at Kansai A/P (Japan) is dysfunctional. I had bought round trip tickets state side for travel from SFO to Kansai due to personal circumstances I ended up buying the trip in 2 segments (for the same day). The first from SFO to Honolulu with a connecting Hawaiian flight to Kansai with similar routing on the return. I was assured I would be able to route my baggage through from SFO to Kansai and visa versa (i.e. without having to pickup and recheck in Honolulu). The agents at SFO were able to do this but the Japanese agent at Kansai insisted that Hawaiian required all baggage picked up at Honolulu with passenger responsibility to recheck bags for continuation flight to SFO. Of course this created undue/unnecessary passenger burden! Bottom line Hawaiian needs to improve training of the Japanese agents they hire for check in at Kansai. I will never take Hawaiian for travel outside the states again!

ITO-OGG-ITO Weekend inter-island flight. It was an uneventful flight. Service from check-in to inflight was amazing. Its the only way to fly.

### Hawaiian Airlines customer review
Flew from Honolulu to Maui on Hawaiian Airlines because of my executive platinum status on AA. With my status we thought that it would give us preferred boarding and no checked bag fees - wrong! I stepped into the "Premier" line to see if we could get on an earlier flight as we were at the airport ahead of schedule. The woman behind the counter rudely told me to get into the other line (no one behind me BTW) because my status on AA "didn't matter" to Hawaiian Airlines even though they were a codeshare partner. I stepped in the other line only to get right back to the same person five minutes later. I asked if we could standby for the earlier flight and she proceeded to charge us $50 per person. For a thirty minute flight with open seats? Decided against that and was rudely reminded that we would still have to pay baggage check fees because they didn't care about our status with AA. Her tone was so rude that I asked to speak to a supervisor who came out and proceeded to complain about AA. I will avoid Hawaiian Airlines at all costs and fly one of the other commuter airlines with better service and lower costs.

### Hawaiian Airlines customer review
JFK-HNL roundtrip. The food on both flights were very good. There were drinks given throughout the flight and you were able to get a drink anytime throughout the flight. The FA's were nice and interacting with the passengers and were polite and were always cleaning the plane. The bathrooms were clean and FA's cleaned them frequently throughout the flight which is something you do not normally see. On the A330 there was plenty of legroom in the economy class. However the one drawback was when I was trying to confirm a seat on the plane the person on the phone was unhelpful and was unable to help my problem. On the flight you also had to pay for the in flight entertainment and they had a big selection of movies to choose from.

### Hawaiian Airlines customer review
We were married in Maui. Our outbound was very good. On our return flight to Vegas we had a medical stop in Oakland. When we landed some passengers got new flights and hotels to stay in two groups were connecting on Southwest however the customer service desk said they don't work with Southwest so they had to find their own accommodation. In the meantime I got a new flight on my own and I gave a staff member the numbers to our new flights to add our luggage to. He promised it would be there then he left without telling us anything. We slept in the airport until the next morning where we flew out. Our luggage was not on the flight with us.

### Hawaiian Airlines customer review
LAX-HNL on the new A330-200 economy class. Boarding at LAX was chaotic and crowded although we were spared the worst of it because we got priority boarding with 2 babies. The flight left on time and arrived about 25 minutes early. There was no wait on the tarmac at HNL for a free gate. Inflight service was much better than average for U.S. carriers food was decent IFE was better than the competition and the cabin crew smiled more and was more attentive than average for U.S carriers.

### Hawaiian Airlines customer review
Honolulu to Maui. Tried to leave on an earlier flight that was not even half full. Arrived at the airport early for that flight only to find out they wanted to charge me extra to change times. Why? Especially on a commuter flight with no meals being served. Very disappointed at the service.

### Hawaiian Airlines customer review
Recently flew HNL-SYD on the 330 aircraft brand new seat and legroom were adequate. Crew were thumbs up food and presentation were great. Kept us well fed/hydrated I was left impressed with the service provided by HA and will definitely fly them over Qantas who operates an older 767 with service no match to Hawaiian.

### Hawaiian Airlines customer review
Hawaiian is my preferred inter-island carrier. This was my first time using them on their Transpacific flight. I flew from Hilo to Las Vegas and was quite impressed. Flight crews on both flights were very warm and welcoming. Any requests were honored with a smile. Flights were smooth both ways. Check-in was a breeze in Hilo and Las Vegas. For meals I was offered a complimentary pasta dish with a piece of cake and a Turkey sandwich on the return. Flight attendants were visible throughout the flight and constant runs of drinks. Very Impressed.

### Hawaiian Airlines customer review
We flew to Honolulu from Sydney in Business Class and returned in Coach. We have a 8 month old son and my wife is vegetarian. On the Business Class leg there was no bassinet available even though promised and we could not be confirmed that any of the food would be vegetarian. As a result our son had to sleep on our laps for an 11 hour flight. Service was very friendly and they assisted us greatly to make it comfortable with pillows but we were trapped in seats for the entire flight. On the return leg seat allocations were not confirmed bassinet not available again and instead of being the front row of the main cabin we were stuck in the middle rows and had to ask passengers in front not to recline so as not to hit our sleeping son. The food was minimal and only 1 meal was vegetarian. Service and food were good but very minimal. There are higher quality ways to get to Hawaii from Australia.

### Hawaiian Airlines customer review
Sydney to Honolulu return over the Easter period. Both flights were full and both aircraft's older refurbished 767's. No AVOD but portable digi players were available for rent at US$15 credit card payment only. A330's will commence on this route soon. Both flights left and arrived on time although check-in at Sydney took 50 minutes because they're weren't enough check-in attendants. Meals on both flights were satisfactory and service was fine although flight attendants were hardly seen between the meal services. Would be happy to fly with them again.

My preferred airline from Sydney to the USA via Honolulu. Generally on time ground staff are great and cabin crew always smiling. Frequent flyer membership has great offers for gold and platinum members. On all my trips baggage arrives quickly and food in both Economy and Business is good.

### Hawaiian Airlines customer review
SYD to Honolulu return. Plane was an older 767 but had been refreshed inside and looks more like a 777. Check-in in Sydney was hassle free. Flight over was fine but seats were a bit uncomfortable. Meals were ok but service was average. Didn't really see attendants that much. No inseat entertainment. you can rent portable DVD style players though. Cabin crew ran out of customs forms so you had to wait to land before these could be filled out which caused a delay at customs. On the way return again check in was hassle free and better than in SYD. All the portable DVD players were gone by the time they got to me. Flight attendants were very nice but rarely seen. All the toilets in the rear of the plan were not working about 6 hours into the flight so a bit of a wait for the other toilets. All in all it was ok.

### Hawaiian Airlines customer review
Sydney to Honolulu with an 8 month old. Never again. No bassinet available on both legs despite reservation. Crew very unhelpful and not interested in assisting us with details of baby change toilet or heating bottles etc. Food was terrible and service not at all satisfactory. I will not fly this airline again. Have flown extensively with my child since he was born both internationally and domestically and Hawaiian certainly takes the cake for being our worst experience.

### Hawaiian Airlines customer review
We used Hawaiian because they had a direct flight. After we booked it was changed to a flight with a layover. Once onboard the flight crew made my wife (then the bride) to roll her wedding dress up and wedge it between luggage in the overhead bin. Flight attendants we very short tempered with us seemed stressed and overall very unpleasant. Our video player stopped working when we got a replacement the audio and video did not match up. The seat tray was covered with dried food when I asked for a cloth to clean it the flight attendant sighed and turned around without answering.

### Hawaiian Airlines customer review
Flying from Vancouver and scheduled to catch the last flight of the evening across to Kona. There was just over an hour between our arrival and departure for Kona. Held in a holding pattern over HON. Once we landed we sprinted for Hawaiian Airlines check-in arriving 30 mins before the flight only to be told it was too late to check-in-. Check-in was rude and unhelpful just basically repeating over and over that we had missed the luggage check-in. We ended up spending a long acutely uncomfortable night sitting at HON airport.

### Hawaiian Airlines customer review
We chose them because of the generous luggage allowances. We were late taking off due to a passenger needing to be removed the delay was handled well with minimum disturbance and the captain kept us all informed. Mid flight there was a medical emergency and that was also handled well. We were given preferred seating as my husband is very tall and we could not fault our seats and the added leg room was wonderful. The flight crew were friendly and attentive. The meal was okay. I wish they had in-seat entertainment. Although not the best flight ever certainly not the worst.

### Hawaiian Airlines customer review
Flew 767-300 Sydney to Hawaii first class. Very uncomfortable broken seats that didn't even recline properly. Terrible food average service. No dinner served and no snacks over an 11 hour flight. Worst airport lounges. Whole experience was dreadfully. Never again!

### Hawaiian Airlines customer review
Just checked in for our first class seat from Maui to Seattle. First class line longer wait than others. Staff very rude went and helped coach line while we were checking in. Another person came back to help us and had to do checking again with her. They didn't tell us our flight was delayed when we checked in. This was a special trip for us and we never travel first class. I can't believe the rude service for such a higher fare that we paid for.

SFO-HNL. Emergency return to SFO 16 hours total delay due A330 computer glitch. Flight crew very good but once on ground things began well and then fell apart. After lunch vouchers and evening hotel rooms for a few they had us all return at 10 pm for a 1 am flight on a different A330. We got to HNL at 4.46 am instead of noon the day before and got $300 vouchers good only on new reservations on Hawaiian for one year.

### Hawaiian Airlines customer review
LAS-HNL-LIH. This was a repeat of last years trip and some things have improved others have not. Ground handling at LAS is much better: the staff were there early enough to check-in bags in good time. The A330s are nice enough planes still looking fresh and clean. Seat back screens do not offer a great deal without payment but is better than nothing. The food offered is basic and not very much. Flight was on time. HNL-LIH was again on time for the very short hop. The planes used on inter-Island sectors are not impressive but they do the job. Return was straightforward. Flights on time no problems not the most comfortable but not too bad.

### Hawaiian Airlines customer review
Just came back from a one week vacation to Honolulu from LA. My trip from LA to HNL was pleasant. No major complaints only minor ones. We left 15 mins late but arrived on time to HNL. My dinner was a sandwich and the bread was mushy. Although the plane is equipped with personal touch screens on every seat there are very few complimentary options to enjoy. You have to pay for movies TV shows music selection and games. On our return from HNL to LA our flight left on time and arrived 15 mins early. Personnel were a lot less enjoyable lnot rude but did not make you feel welcome. There were two different meal options however by my turn they only had sandwiches left. Overall they got the job done and did not experience any major hiccup but at the end of the day we did pay a premium and so I expected more.

### Hawaiian Airlines customer review
HNL-LIH. I've flown this route a few times and generally find Hawaiian to be a bit over-rated and frequently delayed. This time there were no issues. Flight departed on time. Boarding was quick and efficient. B717 in great shape. Smooth ride. Nice crew. Value for money.

### Hawaiian Airlines customer review
Las Vegas from Sydney via Honolulu return. Food was terrible. They had my husband and I sitting separately - despite the fact this happened last time and I went overboard asking for it not to happen again - 4 flights sitting separately. The seats were awfully uncomfortable. General lack of 'couldn't care' by staff. Even when I said I didn't feel well and asked for water they never came back.

### Hawaiian Airlines customer review
LAX-HNL on Airbus A330. Flight was delayed 35 minutes. At first it was announced that the flight was delayed due to TSA requirements. Then it was announced the delay was due to scheduling problems. Boarding commenced shortly after the missing flight attendant arrived. The economy cabin was very cramped. The seat was simply uncomfortable even for a 5 hour flight. The seat was hard and narrow with poor leg room. The IFE system had a decent variety but required a fee (so make sure you have your credit card on hand) though on a full service airline this should be complimentary. Refreshments were served. Breakfast was served shortly after but consisted of a disgusting breakfast burrito and sugary bun with no other options. No complimentary refreshments were available for the remaining 3.5 hours of the flight. The flight attendants were well mannered but unprofessional. The flight concluded with the managing flight attendant listing all of the routes that Hawaiian Airlines services and will service in the future and instructing all passengers to recommend Hawaiian Airlines to all of our family and friends.

### Hawaiian Airlines customer review
Horrible flight from Manila through Hawaii to mainland US. Late leaving Manila and late arrival in Hawaii. 8 passengers missed their connecting flights to US. Extremely poor customer service provided by HA. HA customer service email was just a cover up with excuses for the poor customer service!

### Hawaiian Airlines customer review
Seattle to Hawaii delayed 8 hours. We were given vouchers for two meals and nice accommodation. However upon return our vacation ended poorly. We got a phone call to say the flight would be delayed 6 hours then 8 then 10. Staff struggled to cope with the situation and passengers were treated with little courtesy given the situation. In one notable incident we were asked to line up for an 'ag inspection' only to be told that 'ag inspectors' were not available yet for it. $12 vouchers to cover this 10 hour period were entirely inadequate. Additional costs exceeded this. We were given $200 vouchers for future use on HA for both delays but I seriously doubt we would consider HA for future travel.

### Hawaiian Airlines customer review
Wife and I flew San Jose to Maui via Honolulu. Same route on our return. I found the staff to be pleasant and accommodating. The food offered was ok but we did not expect much more. My complaint was with the airplane seat. I am 6’4” and 205lbs. The seats were so uncomfortable with no leg room. Despite getting up and walking around a bit it was torturous having to return to my seat. On our next trip I may pony up for a First Class seat – the continued pain is just not worth it.

### Hawaiian Airlines customer review
We fly Hawaiian because it is the only non-stop from HNL to San Diego. Flight from HNL to SD on 767 had incredibly little legroom I'm only 5'5" and couldn't get my legs under the seat in front due to some metal box affixed to floor. FA's were okay.

### Hawaiian Airlines customer review
Honolulu to San Francisco. Outbound food which you have to buy onboard was expensive and limited. The return flight was delayed by at least 10 hours and we decided to book ourselves onto another airline. Staff did not know which reception point would have our bags; we then had to find our way out of the building to another terminal and check-in again paying a further $50 for our two suitcases. The check-in arrangements at Honolulu are poor - too few people handling the check-in for Economy Class.

### Hawaiian Airlines customer review
Sydney to Honolulu return. I have really only one complaint because Australia and Perth in particular is so far away the time spent sitting in one spot for over 12-15 hrs is hard enough without the seating and general facilities being less than user friendly. Return flight from Honolulu to Sydney was very cramped (leg room) and there was a lot less overhead baggage space than the flight to Honolulu. This made the experience more uncomfortable than it could have been.

### Hawaiian Airlines customer review
Honolulu to Hilo on a Boeing 717. The flight was very average. Check-in was a mess. Had to wait in line for a machine and when you checked in your bags you needed to wait for someone who works for Hawaiian to come. The service was average they come around with juice during flight. You barely even new there were FA's. Overall I didn't expect much and I didn't get much.

### Hawaiian Airlines customer review
From check-in to arrival nothing went right from HNL to LAX. Our carry-ons were acceptable on the way from LAX-HNL and not on the return. We were warned I would be removed from the flight if I refused to check-in baggage. The flight from HNL-LAX departed 30 mins later than scheduled. The flight attendant threw my sandwich in my lap. The night crew from HNL to LAX were not friendly with no smile from a single crew member. The plane was very old (767). My husbands seat had a metal piece sticking out between the backrest and the seat. Bring your own headset or portable DVD if you want technology. Our flight from LAX to HNL was delayed and we sat on the plane for more than 1.5 hrs. I would not recommend Hawaiian airlines you get what you pay for.

Sydney-Honolulu return. Upon check-in at Sydney advised that we were split up. Food was only one option. Planes old with no in seat entertainment unless you pay $15USD for a portable unit.

Honolulu-Seattle return on B767. Baggage handling and boarding staff were lovely. I was in Economy class and the seats were comfortable I managed to sleep. Flight attendants were friendly and available in the aisles food choices were delicious safety instructions were polite and clear. Lavatories were clean inflight entertainment had plenty of choice.

Sydney-Honolulu-Sydney. Pleased with the services both in the air and on the ground. The check-in staff at Sydney airport were pleasant and courteous. The meal after take-off from Sydney was ok. The outbound flight was an overnight one and an eye-shade was offered which was nice. The check-in staff were kind and helpful when checking-in for return flight at Honolulu airport. The home-bound inflight service was excellent cockpit crew for both flights were first-class. The cabin crew are sincere laid-back and easily approachable.

HNL-LAS on an A330. New aircraft in excellent condition. Paid to upgrade to a Premium seat in bulkhead row 14 which had at least 48 inches of legroom. Great IVOD offerings but limited free selections. Meal was adequate and accompanied by great cabin service throughout the flight. I have avoided Hawaiian in the past while the numerous fees have only got worse with time this was all-in-all an unexpectedly good flight.

### Hawaiian Airlines customer review
First class from HNL-SMF. We have flown First Class several times before on this route but this flight was exceptional. The flight attendants went out of their way to make sure we were well taken care of and checked on us regularly to make sure we had whatever we needed. Hawaiian has a real asset with this crew. On the flip side I do have complaints not related to the staff of Hawaiian. I am a Premier Club member and upon rejoining this year I found out that the benefits have changed. Members and a companion were allowed two pieces of checked luggage gratis. That has now changed to only the member getting that. We used to be able to ask for an exit row and that has also changed and now you pay $25. It's difficult justifying paying $249 a year for a rest in a room at the airport and some packaged snacks.

### Hawaiian Airlines customer review
Manila-Seattle via Honolulu and return with an additional stopover in Maui. Flights were labelled as Business Class (MNL-HNL) and First Class (HNL-SEA) though in fact there is no difference in cabin or service. All flights were on Hawaiian's elderly 767's. Do not be fooled by the winglets (which HA added to save fuel) these are old planes with interiors to match. Also do not for a moment think you will be getting anything like a Business or First Class product on a first tier airline this would be a mediocre Premium Economy product at best. The seat I would guesstimate the pitch to be around 38-40" with limited recline and in a 2-2-2 layout with only 3 rows. I am 6ft 5" and sat in 1B for all sectors this bulkhead seat has the advantage that you don't have someone reclining their head into your lap but the leg space is woefully inadequate. I had to sit at an angle with my feet into the forward galley to get at all comfortable. The AV comprised personal players that were handed out with a limited range of films and TV shows pre-loaded. Unfortunately this was the same content for all 4 long haul flights and by the end of the first flight I had already watched all that interested me. It was also awkward to use these during the meal service as there was basically nowhere to put them. Food was adequate although dry and uninspiring. The "champagne" served on take off was in fact a fairly unpleasant Prosecco and the single white wine choice with the meal was probably a hazard to the aircraft paintwork if you spilled any. As with all airplane travel the quality of the experience is relative to the price you have paid. Clearly Hawaiian are used to people upgrading into this cabin either as a frequent flyer freebie or as a $1-200 add on to the regular ticket price in which case possibly its worth it but probably not.

### Hawaiian Airlines customer review
LAX-HNL A330 a nice new plane but very disappointing experience. Carry-on baggage size limit not enforced making those of us who paid the $25 feel like fools. Boarding time on boarding pass 45 mins ahead but boarding does not begin until 30 mins before (happened on another HA flight so assume that Hawaiian thinks passengers too stupid to get there on time) causing uncomfortable wait in undersized departure lounge. The inflight "meal" they boast about is a tasteless ham and cheese sandwich with a brownie served in a cardboard box- a "snack" at best. Flight attendants not friendly lacking any Aloha spirit. Had hoped that Hawaiian would be better.

### Hawaiian Airlines customer review
HNL-SYD. Travelling with 4 young children and wife. Departure delayed by 2 hrs. Nice new 767 but no personal AVOD. Could not get infant seat belt for 1 yr old despite repeated request. My wife was quite worried as this has always been available when needed. Staff seemed uninterested almost unhelpful and sometimes rude. Kept to themselves gossiping in the back of the plane. Food was ok. Toilets started to break down half way through the 10 hr flight. 3 hrs out of SYD no toilets were working! A cabin announcement was made advising that passengers should refrain from using toilets especially depositing "solids". Captain advised on landing that he considered landing in Fiji but by the time pax would be deplaned it would have been about the same time to reach a working toilet. Sometimes things go wrong which is understandable but cabin crew were very poor. A memorable experience!

### Hawaiian Airlines customer review
I am not a fussy person but I really thought this was the worst service I have ever had on an airline. Both ground staff and cabin crew were rude to me on a number of occasions about the fact that I am diabetic. I was given a hard time about my need to carry "sharps" with me even though I offered to hand them over to the cabin crew. The food wasn't very good and there were only 2 choices of meals. One was totally unsuitable for a diabetic so I asked if I could have the alternative choice reserved for me. They refused and I got stuck with the unsuitable food (because they ran out of the other choice) on each leg of my journey. My requests re the food and carrying my diabetic supplies were quite reasonable and I made them in a very polite manner and yet I was treated like a real trouble-maker. This was not what I expected from Hawaiians who I know to be very hospitable people. A huge disappointment and I would not fly willingly with them again.

### Hawaiian Airlines customer review
Horrible experience. SEA-OGG and back and was severely harassed for trying to use my common Graco infant car seat to keep my baby safe in flight (the airline approval sticker was partially ripped off however you could clearly see it was airline approved). Once they finally said I could use it I was not allowed to use the car seat correctly (rear-facing) as they said it would not allow the person in front of it to recline their seat. Never mind that there were very many empty seats on this flight they could have moved this person to including the empty seat next to him if it had bothered him. Then was harassed because they assumed I had not purchased a seat for my infant when in fact I had and was required to show my tickets to them. Again despite having at least 8 empty seats within four rows of the seat I was in - it was a very empty flight. I fly often and have never experienced such horrible customer service.

SYD-HNL-SYD Economy. An older B767 but for a 3 star airline I thought service was pretty good. They looked after the kids with kids meals and were always offering free drinks and mid flight snacks. We also flew to Maui return from HNL and the service was the best I have experienced.

### Hawaiian Airlines customer review
Excellent service on LAX-HNL flight on new A330. The seat is a mistake but everything else top rate. The food service IFE. I hope they continue with their current meal service and don't adopt the mistake they've made on their international runs by changing it!

### Hawaiian Airlines customer review
Seats cramped - even for 5'6" and 140 lbs and the equipment is ancient. Mine had bilingual German/English everywhere. They charge for everything almost. Want to use a headset -you pay. Want to use your own headset to watch the movie - you pay. Don't want the mystery meat sandwich - you pay ($12 for a hamburger that would be like a buck at Mac's). You want overhead room - get on board first and expect no help from the cabin attendants standing around talking about their personal lives with one another. You want to rent a DVD player. Maybe you can maybe you cannot. They had the players but forgot to bring batteries on board. Hawaiian is like a poor man's Southwest. Unless the fare you get is way below the competition I cannot see why you would fly with them.

### Hawaiian Airlines customer review
We were supposed to leave at 3PM but due to aircraft problems we ended up taking off at 2am the next day to begin our trip home to San Diego. The flight attendants were wonderful and very supportive. Hawaiian airlines gave us a free shuttle to a local mall while we were at the airport. We got free movie tickets and a $200 voucher and gave us good snacks etc. We also got a discount on our next purchase.

### Hawaiian Airlines customer review
LAX-HNL-LAX. Check-in in LAX was good. New A330 service in F class to HNL was good. Seats are not flat. Return to LAX with aged B767. Check-in staff in HNL rude and charged me $50 extra for an overweight bag by 3lbs even I'm a 1st class pax. My overweight bag was lost upon arrival in LAX which was returned to me almost a week later. The delivery man was lost so I met him 20 miles from my residence. If HA wants to be a world class airline they should take some lessons leading airlines in Asia and Middle East.

### Hawaiian Airlines customer review
Honolulu-Manila Business Class. Very disappointed to note that Hawaiian Airlines new upgraded inflight service is a real downgrade. They've ditched the tapas style menu for a slow food service. In addition they are no longer catered by Chef Gannon and for the first time in years I was served bad food on Hawaiian Airlines. The flight attendants were wonderful but clearly embarrassed by the downgrade. In addition the new printed menus are tacky. Also time to retire the 767. Just not up to standard for a 10 hour plus flight!

LAX-HNL-SYD-HNL-LAX.Flew from the US to Australia on Hawaiian in first/business on a discounted fare. Seat comfort is significantly better than US legacy carriers domestic first class but well short of modern international business class standards but comfortable enough for the long flights - an old style business class product. Service and food exceptional. The cabin staff go the extra mile in attentiveness up front and the tapas style menus were creative and tasty. IFE is good not great. Lounges in LAX and HNL are dreadful but HA business class passengers can access the Air New Zealand lounge in SYD which is exceptional.

Honolulu to Sydney. Worst service of any airline I have flown. I am a vegetarian did not have an option for me except a few bags of chips. When asked for a can of coke they said they were nearly out and could only give us a cup. Cabin staff unhelpful and not friendly.

### Hawaiian Airlines customer review
SYD-HNL-SEA and back via HNL to SYD. Whilst I agree with some of the comments re the indifference of cabin staff (I had to ask for water after 2 hours on the ground owing to a mechanical problem) I will continue to fly Hawaiian because baggage allowance is the best in the air and I have always found check-in staff helpful. Two seats outside the aisles are the best way for a couple to fly no need to constantly wake a stranger to use the facilities or stretch my legs food is to my taste good safety record.

### Hawaiian Airlines customer review
SYD-HNL flight was great and seating comfortable. HNL to SYD was full and extremely uncomfortable. I was seated next to a young fat boy I paid for my seat and feel entitled to the whole seat I paid for. When an airlines allocates seat they should be aware of the size of the person. I'm petite and fit comfortably in a seat but when an oversized person is put beside be that takes 1/4 of my seat. When I complained the hostess said 'sorry we are fully booked'.

### Hawaiian Airlines customer review
HNL-SYD on B767-300ER. I bought a discount Economy ticket but was able to upgrade at the gate to Business Class for $400. It was well worth it. HA Business Class seat is an old style business class seat not a reclining flat bed. Nevertheless with the spacious pitch and large foot rest it was comfortable for dozing. IFE is a portable media player which was fine since no one was seated next to me. It wasn't stable there. The movie selection was not first run but it was adequate for a ten hour flight. There was no power outlet in the seat for my laptop. The food and service were excellent. The meal was a selection of three dishes from an assortment and were delicious. The wine selection was ok but the mixed drinks were fun as you would expect in Hawaii. Most importantly the service was exceptional friendly and helpful

### Hawaiian Airlines customer review
Since Hawaiian Airlines began charging a fee for checked bags the volume of carry-on luggage has become quite unreasonable. Last month ny husband and I traveled first class from Portland to Honolulu and back. As first class passengers and because my husband uses a wheelchair we boarded first. When the coach passengers began to board my husband and I were literally smacked in the head and shoulders with carry-on luggage - large tote bags overloaded backpacks and even a child safety seat. We had to lean into the space between the seats in order to avoid injury. When I got home I contacted Hawaiian Airlines "customer advocacy" program because I wanted to report my experience. A very bored representative took my report and told me someone would get back to me. Three weeks later I had not heard a word from the company. I called again. This time a super-rude rep with minimal language skills told me they had no record of my prior call. When I began again to explain about being smacked in the head and shoulders by carry-on luggage she said 'Well I sorry you have inconvenience". Now that Alaska Airlines is flying non-stop from Portland to Honolulu I will never fly Hawaiian Airlines again.

Honolulu to Lihue return. Going out the plane was full service was efficient and friendly. Coming back I flew standby but was told in advance that there many seats on the plane and that I would have no problem getting on. When I arrived the plane was full and the ground agent did not give me a boarding pass until the plane was fully boarded. She had me running to get on the plane even though she was fully aware of the vacant seat and she could have given it to me minutes earlier. When I boarded the plane the flight attendant approached me and told me they were all waiting for me and that I needed to hurry up!

### Hawaiian Airlines customer review
LAX-HNL. The aircraft was downgraded from a new A330 to a well worn 767. Most of the FAs were helpful and did their best in the cramped and crowded aisles. A problem with the galley ovens meant there would be no hot meals served. Those of us seated up front were served cold and tasteless appetizers and nothing more. This was truly not Hawaiian Airlines at its best and not worth the $349 upgrade paid prior to boarding.

### Hawaiian Airlines customer review
SYD-HNL-SYD with connecting flights to the Big Island. Check-in at Sydney was efficient and in the air service was good. Food wasn't but my expectations were not high given the price of the ticket. Connecting flight to Kona and return went without a hitch but the return leg to Sydney was a nightmare. Had to queue for 40 minutes to check-in at Honolulu and though we boarded on time departure was delayed 45 minutes to due "flight path" issues we were told. Turns out the plane was overloaded and they removed some of the baggage including ours which they obviously knew about at Honolulu but didn't tell us. If they had we could have made our connecting flight at Sydney. Instead we were left to flounder at the carousel missed our flight and had to spend a night in Sydney along with maybe 50 others. Hawaiian paid for the hotel (20 km from the airport) and baggage arrived three days later but I won't be flying with them again if I have a choice.

### Hawaiian Airlines customer review
Disappointed that on a short flight between Honolulu and Maui we were charged 20 dollars a piece for two small bags that could have been carried on but for the fact we had to bring articles not allowed in the carry-on bags in the cabin. We will be charged the same to return - this is very cheap and I feel this airline is nickel and diming customers given the already high fares charged for inter island flights.

### Hawaiian Airlines customer review
Sydney to Honolulu return. Check-in at Sydney was good and flight on time. The staff SYD-HNL may as well not have been there. One female attendant was extremely unfriendly and really did not want to be there. Food was mediocre at best but it was an overnight flight so not so bad I guess as most of the time was spent sleeping! Honolulu to Sydney was the opposite. The staff went out of their way to oblige in all requests. Service with a smile and there was plenty of it. Drinks frequent meals were ok and flight went smoothly. It is an older style plane and not the most comfortable but I was prepared for all the little negatives.

LAS-HNL-LIH. Midnight madness flight out of Las Vegas at 1.40pm. We could not drop our bags until after midnight as they opened late had only two or three staff on hand and they were dealing with would be stand-bys leaving ticketed passengers to stand and wait and wait. Finally got onboard and got off. The new A330s are good planes. Seat back screens in all classes clean and as comfortable as economy gets. Arrived in Honolulu early morning and transferred over to the inter-island section. small plane arrived on time the flight over to Kaua'i was a mere 20 minutes but was so rough no beverage service was attempted. Not a problem. On the way back it was all pretty smooth. The meals/snacks on the long flights are small but very welcome. There were many drink rounds and the staff did appear to genuinely care about the customers. If only they could sort out staffing on the mainland!

HNL to LAX on Boeing 767. I booked a window seat but for reason that I can't understand (my english was poor!) the staff asked me to seat in the middle seat of main line of seats with two fat men on each side of me. It was terrible They pressured me all time I was sleepy the flight was full and I had nowhere to move to.

Sydney to Honolulu and purchased internal flights to Kahului and Hilo. SYD-HNL was good considering the price paid if you compare to other airlines offering the same route. The staff were friendly and attentive. The inter-island flights departed on time and the service was again enjoyable- and loved the views of the Hawaiian Islands.

### Hawaiian Airlines customer review
LAX-HNL-ITO return economy and first. LAX-HNL segment on an old but immaculate 767-300. Bulkhead row with plenty of legroom and enough room to change a nappy (diaper) on the floor. Hawaiian Airlines is the only US airline to offer complimentary food in all classes on domestic flights - food was quite tasty. The inflight entertainment was average - for $15 you can rent a cumbersome hand-held unit with 12-15 movies 12-15 TV programmes music videos and audio tracks. The $15 is pretty steep but it's better than standard IFE on other US airlines. HNL-ITO and ITO-HNL on B717-200s which have assigned seats and first class cabin. Service very good and beverages ae offered on the 40 minute flights. HNL-LAX segment with the new A330-200. We upgraded to first class for $300 per seat - recliner seats have adjustable legrests and footrests and recline to about 130 degrees. The controls are non-electronic and the legrests are a bit difficult to push back in place. Food service very good. Hawaiian's first class is very good value for flights to the USA but does not compete with Korean Qantas Delta or the Asian airlines on flights to the Pacific Rim. Service on all flights is cordial and friendly and FA's are more professional and customer-friendly than other US airlines.

Sydney to Oahu Oahu to Las Vegas return. The crew were great. When we landed back in Hawaii from Vegas another passenger accidentally took my friends cabin bag.

SFO-HNL. Boarding procedure seemed a bit haphazard and gate area became crowded but eventually everyone boarded the plane. Gate staff friendly as were flight attendants. Premium meal offered both ways - this is a cashless airline so you need a credit card to pay for this. We were directed at SFO to use the self service check in but were advised not to do this or use online check in as we are international pax. As we are from the UK we did not have to pay any baggage fees to and from the Mainland (had to show check in staff our flight details from the UK). Hawaiian Airlines website unbelievably does not as yet have the ability to process applications from passengers in the UK so we used their UK based agent to book our flights. Flight back to SFO ten days later left late due to potential problem with aircraft (rectified on the ground). Hand baggage was weighed at check in at Honolulu but not at SFO.

### Hawaiian Airlines customer review
Flight crowded but ok. However very dissatisfied with Hawaiian Airlines baggage policy. If you are flying with them multiple times you have to wait 24 hours before each flight to prepay to save $2 that that offer for prepaying. So with 8 people traveling from New England to Hawaii not only are we not allowed one lousy piece of luggage but we can't even prepay unless we track down a computer in California and on each island that we visit because you are not allowed to call in to pay or to do it earlier than 24 hours. Our Luggage bill for each person to bring 1 piece of luggage adds up to $528. How ridiculous!

### Hawaiian Airlines customer review
Check-In was ok and that's about it. The crew were your typical US carrier and everyone was just a pain to them. They threw the meal bag and any request for a drink was treated with a grunt. They sat in the rear galley for the rest of the flight.

LAX-HNL-KOA return First Class. LAX Premier Club Lounge very small and basic with limited food and drink options. Transpacific flights on new A330 but old style reclining seats with a footrests a big let-down. IFE screen and choices very good. Catering quite tasty for domestic first class though quality was much higher out of LAX than HNL. Flight attendants professional and attentive. Inter-island first class is not value unless you're on a through fare. HNL airport is in serious need of a make-over - old poorly run counter-intuitive muted staff and barebones lounges. For a US carrier HA is not a bad operation but not all that special in any way either.

LAX-HNL roundtrip First class on new A330. Good seat and legroom though expected more recline for newer plane that they plan to use for future international routes. Service was great! Meal was good (get to pick 3 of 5 choices on menu). IFE great enjoyed the selection of movies and programming. Flew coach back on new A330 and pretty impressed - more legroom and slightly better recline than older Hawaiian 767s. Have to pay for movies/videos on IFE in coach though. One of the few domestic airlines that still serve complimentary meals in coach.

### Hawaiian Airlines customer review
Las Vegas to Honolulu  good on time flight coach seating adequate best seats for legroom are 26AC or 26HJ on Boeing 767 aircraft. First Class seating looked good but not worth paying anything over $250 for upgrades on US Mainland to Hawaii flights would obviously be happy to pay more for longer distance flights. Good choice of meal you can have a free meal or choose to pay for an upgraded meal which I did and was a good move free coffees and soft drinks. Very friendly and smiling cabin crew great start to Hawaiian trip.

### Hawaiian Airlines customer review
Sydney to Honolulu flight was most uncomfortable seating. Temperature in the cabin was extremely warm and unbearable. On our return flight a more comfortable trip seating wise but the cabin was extremely cold throughout the 10 hour flight. Even the thin blankets supplied did not do us any good. Everyone was dragging out extra jackets to put on. The aircraft also left from the domestic terminal and we were unable to take advantage of buying duty free there because no one told us prior that once we booked in we couldn't get to the International Terminal to purchase goods. All international flights should leave from the International Terminal.

Honolulu to Las Vegas. Very helpful guy at Honolulu airport got us through the boarding process fast this seemed to set the standard on our flight everything went well. I have flown on a number of American airlines any this flight was as good as I have had to date. The food is typical USA airline style but far from the worst I have had. Only one complaint this was the coldest flight I have ever been on in over 35 years of flying it is the first time I have ever found it necessary to wrap myself in an airline blanket 90% of the passengers were similarly wrapped in blankets. My wife asked why the plane was so cold but none of the crew seemed to know.

### Hawaiian Airlines customer review
SFO-HNL-KOA and back. Hawaiian advertises their outstanding service and free meals and beverages. They kept changing our flights and departure times I had to call them and rebook us on a flight that would not arrive 8 hours later than the flight I paid for. At the airport (SFO) there was no gate information we had to ask our way through to find out which the departure gate is. When we started boarding there was still no gate information. The staff seemed to be very unmotivated they had different groups for boarding but no one actually enforced that. By the time we got to our seats almost everyone in front of us was already there and all luggage bins were full. Hidden charges: You have to pay extra for each piece of luggage you want to check in. On the way to KOA no one cared about our carry-on luggage. BUT on the way back they were inspecting every single piece of luggage checking the measurements and the weight. If it was larger or heavier than the allowed size/weight for carry-on items you had to check it in (and pay of course). The meals nothing special I probably would have been better off with home made sandwiches. It was not worth the higher price we paid. On the plane the service was okay I wouldn't call it outstanding you get the same service as on almost any other airline. On the ground the service was very bad - staff very unhelpful and unfriendly. Hawaiian's "service" doesn't make up for the higher air fare that you are paying. flying with United or Alaska Airlines when you fly to Hawaii. The have direct flights to certain islands this way you don't waste your time in Honolulu waiting for a connecting flight.

### Hawaiian Airlines customer review
MNL-SEA and LAS-MNL. Overall a disappointing experience and we won't make the mistake of booking it again. It was really like taking a domestic US flight across the Pacific when there are so many options on international airlines. The service amenities and aircraft are not comparable. Manila check-in was ok but they had problems with non-working printers and were unable to print all of our boarding passes (they told us to just pick up the last one in HNL because they couldn't figure it out). We boarded the 20+ year-old 767 with overhead bins sized from the 80's no IFE and ageing cabin. The flight attendants all appeared to be senior and had a lot of attitude. We overheard one flight attendant insult an elderly passenger behind her back because the passenger requested to change her new blanket which had hairs on it. The mocking and poor attitude of flight attendants which other reviewers below referred to was true on our flight. To watch movies they rented personal DVD players for $15 per segment. With a change of plane in HNL that meant 4 segments round-trip or $60 per person to watch movies. When we inquired if there was a seafood option (the only choices were chicken and pork) the flight attendant replied they used to have special meals but no longer offer them. On the return flight from LAS we stopped over in HNL for a night but were charged baggage fees for that segment because it was technically a domestic flight - $25 per bag. Finally we took off from HNL-MNL and weren't in the air for 30 minutes when the captain announced a faulty generator requiring us to return to HNL (again a 20+ year-old 767). However we had to burn fuel first so we flew in circles at 7000 ft for 4 hours with the landing gear and flaps fully extended - an uncomfortable ride. The flight attendants were plain combative with understandably worried and upset passengers. Six hours later we landed in HNL again. They arranged another plane with a new crew and we arrived in MNL 8 hours late. To make matters worse they left behind baggage of at least 50 passengers in HNL so there was an ugly queue of irate passengers at 2:30 am after an 8 hour delay. We received our luggage two days later. We wrote a letter to Hawaiian but they did not respond. All in all if we had flown on CX or KE or OZ via HKG or SEL to the mainland we could've avoided a tremendous amount of hassle (eg. having to collect your bags and check-in again in HNL) being nickel and dimed (eg. luggage fees and DVD rental fees) poor service (being insulted by flight attendant) and delays from old faulty aircraft. I should also mention I felt bad for the business class passengers who paid $2000+ for their seats. The seats in business class are domestic US first class seats - very little recline and leg room. You have many choices and until Hawaiian actually starts caring about their transpacific passengers we are not flying them again.

First Class LAX to HNL-LIH. First class was mediocre. The first class cabin was quite crowded seats weren't that large. Nothing was electric on the seat an older manual style. The entertainment consisted of small video units passed out to each passenger -entertainment choice was terrible. The food was ok drinks were fine. The staff was exceptionally nice and the cabin was clean. It was all quite mundane and functional.

Honolulu to Manila. They made us wait for hours outside the boarding area by the hallway with no seats- in Honolulu. They only let us in the boarding area room when it was time for us to board the plane. In Manila they only have 3-people checking in. It took me 2.5 hours to get checked in. There were a lot of empty seats at the back and they would not let any of us transfer since they are all reserved for their attendants - one whole row for each attendant. It doesn't make any sense - we were all cramped in the forward cabin and every time I use the bathrooms at the back - these reserved seats were not used by the attendants. I overheard the attendants congregating at the back making fun of the Filipino passengers - they copied their strong accents and made fun of their requests. I thought that this was so unprofessional. I guess because the fare is cheaper you get cheaper service. The only thing I like about the flight is its direct flight - the schedule is so convenient. Food is average nothing special.

SJC-HNL-LIH. I booked our flight 3 months in advance - only to find a month later that the company offered a Hawaiian Plus fare for $200 per ticket cheaper than the ones I had purchased. This Plus fare included 2 free checked bags as well! The Hawaiian Plus fare was not even offered at the time I made the reservation. The checked baggage for our trip will cost an additional $100! When talking to customer service and asking that our bag fee be waived I was told by the service representative and supervisor that they could not do this. It is amazing that the two service representative did not recognize how the airline "Policy" makes little sense. Future travel on this airline is highly doubtful. The trip was to celebrate my wife 50th birthday and all I can do cross my fingers and hope the rest of the experience with Hawaii will be positive.
