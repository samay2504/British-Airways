### “cheapness in service is apparent”
Do not fly on Breeze. First of all, the flights may appear cheap at first, but they nickel and dime you for everything. Secondly, they don’t stand behind their service. They broke a brand new piece of luggage that was being used for first time. There was no one at the airport to report this to. We reported when we got home immediately. They would not do anything about it because they said it was more than one hour since we landed. That is a ridiculous timeframe to give someone to report, especially when you don’t staff anyone at the airport. Their cheapness in service is apparent. Fly a quality airline, not breeze. It is not worth the bad service experience to fly with Breeze.

### "this airline is no bargain"
Not Verified |  Breeze is a terrible airline. It is frequently late, ground staff are rude and incompetent, and baggage is frequently misplaced. The wifi frequently does not work. And for your $400 R/T ticket you get a "free" glass of water. There is no one to talk to in customer service when you have a problem you must use their chat service on the app which is basically a bot with pre-set answers. It is very frustrating. Also, once you add up the cost of the flight with the charges for carryons, luggage and seat selection, this airline is no bargain. Its likely the same price or less expensive to fly on a major carrier and pay for ground transportation.

### "one of the worst days of my life"
Not Verified |  Emergency landing at JFK from West Chester after engine failure and we were told to brace for a very hard and difficult landing. Then shown different ways we may need to evacuate the plane. All 137 passengers were terrified and forced to remain in our seats as fire trucks, emergency vehicles and police surrounded the plane. After almost an hour of sitting there they allowed us to make it to a gate where we were then asked to get in a bus that drove around in circles until finally dropping us off at some far away terminal with one  random flight attendant who knew nothing and was not being told anything by anyone. We needed fresh air, we needed to feel support and guidance, we needed to not feel even more stress and anxiety than we had all already suffered. All of us passengers were told to remain in the section of the terminal with NO answers for hours. the fact that we went through all of that with zero guidance or communication from anyone was absolutely disgusting. Breeze airways should be completely ashamed of the way we were treated and after eleven hours the passengers who chose to stay to try and board the next available flight- are still be delayed and given no answers. This was one of the worst days of my life.

### "horrible customer care"
Horrendous, 4+ hrs delay. Horrible service, horrible customer care. Won't reimburse for the wasted hours, wasted money on car rental return late, won't reimburse money for the food you have to eat for the 4 hour delay. Even though you paid for the seats the is includes wifi, the delayed flight wifi didn't work. Then when you had to spend 50 dollars on a taxi at 3am they won't reimburse but they will respond with a fake sincerity of we hope you fly with breeze again here's a lousy 5000 points, which is only worth about 50 bucks. Horrible, should've stuck with southwest.

### "unsatisfied and frustrated"
Not Verified |  I used Breeze Airways from South Bend IN to Ft. Myers FL on 2-12-25. Loved it. No problems at all. Return flight from Ft. Myers FL to So, Bend IN on 2-22-25 was delayed a few times & then cancelled due to required maintenance. OK, things happen. Long story short, I found an alternate return flight on United Airlines. The hook is that although Breeze did credit my card for their cancelled flight, they had offered a reimbursement for additional expenses incurred up to $150.00. I submitted my reimbursement claim, rec'd email from them that add'l proof was required. Resubmitted, rec'd email add'l proof was required. Four times total I have resubmitted my claim for reimbursement & every time I get the same email asking for resubmission. No phone number to contact them direct & speak with a representative. Very unsatisfied and frustrated at what I believe should have been a simple transaction. They cancelled, issued travel points, issued credit for that portion of my travel then I was left with additional expenses & hours more of travel time. Their direct flight should have been 3 hours; I spent 9 hours getting back. I'm not a picky person, but if I could talk to someone that could explain to me clearly what add'l proof they need I would feel be more inclined to give a better review.

### "incompetence is unbelievable"
Not Verified |  After getting off the plane I realized I no longer had my new sunglasses so my sister went back to get them. The worker would not let her on the plane saying he would have to go look. He spent two minutes looking and came back and said he could not find them. The sunglasses are 100% on the plane but he somehow could not find them and would not let my sister go look for them. The level of incompetence is unbelievable to me. How hard would it be to look a little harder or to let one of us go look for them. Don’t fly with them if there is a slight chance you might accidentally forget something cause you will not get whatever it is back.

### "never fly Breeze Airways again"
Not Verified |  I will never fly Breeze Airways again. They say $50 but eventually with no bags and random seating came to $178 for round trip flight. First flight they kept pushing back time because of maintenance on plane. They boarded plane and then had everyone get off. Over 3 hours later we finally started boarding. I didn’t complain. I really try to understand stuff happens and pick my battles. On flight back from Orlando I-75 had two different traffic jams and I gave myself 3 hours and was under 2 hours away. I got there with 55 mins before. I went to bathroom and got in line for boarding pass. Employees were helping others as I patiently waited. Finally I get up to front desk and they say cut off was a minute ago. They spend 5-7 calling supervisor and they go sorry nothing we can do turn around and start grabbing empty bins to load up. Go to information desk nothing they can do. Try to call Breeze Airways and they have no customer service number only text with automated system. I didn’t think there was a worse airline than spirit but they definitely are.

### "probably fly them again"
I’ve flown them before in 2023 to the same destination, but this time the outgoing flight was delayed 43 minutes leaving Raleigh (a night flight). Returning on the same plane several days later, the flight got delayed several times (with automated texts) but it was only a few hours. With the reviews on here I was bracing for cancellations and bought trip insurance as a precaution upon booking. Flight was otherwise comfortable and employees nice. Pilot was apologetic about the mechanical delays several times and the airline emailed me notifying about the extra points added to my account once we landed. Will probably fly them again.

### "Will never fly Breeze again"
Flight was scheduled to leave at 9:30 pm. After literally 9 delays, we finally took off at 4:12 am and landed at 5:30 am. Absolutely no sleep after spending the night in the airport. Could have gotten a hotel, slept, and then gone to the airport. Security was actually open for the next day already. Was offered no food or drink while we waited and all the stores were closed. To add insult to injury, was only offered points to use on another flight at the equivalent of $50. Will never fly Breeze again.

### "horrible customer service"
Breeze has horrible customer service. I contacted them to cancel a reservation for someone in my party. The only way to contact them is via text. The customer service rep told me they would separate out the fare and give me partial credit. Come to find out, they never canceled the fare and when I contacted them again they told me I forfeited the fare. When I sent them the previous texts showing them why I was confused they did not offer any way for me to escalate the concern. Breeze is inexpensive but you take your chances of losing that money as they have no real customer service.

### “terrible customer service”
Overall terrible customer service. I never take the time to write reviews but I was so dismayed with the customer service I just received. I tried to book a flight for March 27 on their website and I verified the date many times throughout the booking process. At some point just before booking, their website must have re-loaded and changed the date to a week later. I didn't check my email right away so I didn't realize for 2 days, at which point I contacted them (which is only possible via text or email no matter how many times you ask to speak with someone on the phone), and they say they would've helped me if I had contacted them immediately but since it had been 2 days and I had booked a no flex fare, there was nothing they would do. I tried explaining the situation multiple times but I came to the realization that since it is so difficult to even write a review at all, they just don't care. There's a reason they don't offer phone support since this would add the humanity aspect of customer service. If you want a budget airline with cheap and direct flights to lesser travelled destinations, Breeze is just that. If you care about anything else or want someone to help you in the case that anything goes wrong, this is not the airline for you.

### “Plane departed nearly 3 hours late”
Plane departed PVD nearly 3 hours late, which meant my car rental was closed. Hertz was unable to change my pickup time because of this, and could not guarantee next day reservation. This led to a cascade of extra costs: meals, hotels, alternative transport, etc. All because of a crew scheduling screwup by Breeze. Several hundred extra dollars out of pocket as a result. The convenience of flying direct from Providence to Vero Beach was completely wiped out. I have flown this route 4 times: 2 were OK; 2 were disasters.

### "lost my bag for multiple days"
Not Verified |  Never in my life have a had a customer service experience this bad ever. Not only was my flight cancelled 3 times before finally giving me the worst departure time available, but they also lost my bag for multiple days. Since they don’t have a phone number, I had to sit waiting for an automated text message for over a day with no response or indication of where my bag had gone. No one could tell me where my bag was or how to get it back at all, when i repeated tried to get in contact with an agent, not a single person could get back to me. So I have spent over $60 ubering to the airport to speak to someone at the breeze desk, in which no one was there at all. I still have no idea where my bag is or if I will even get it back and have no way of reaching out to an agent to get compensation. Absolutely insane and I don’t know how they are still in business with the way they are operating.

### "not recommend this airline"
Not Verified |  Breeze failed on both flight directions. 1st flight was 3 hours late arriving, delayed our arrival 4 hours. 2nd flight was canceled. They have so few planes there were no alternative breeze flights. Sadly, they have no agreements with other airlines to move passengers to other airline. Refund was inadequate and didn't cover hotel and alternative travel costs. 0.0 customer service, they want you to text a number which does not provide a solution. I would not recommend this airline. You can't count on this airline to stay on schedule or get you home. When a problem arises they don't have the ability to solve it. You are better off driving, or taking one of the major airlines.

### "the plane had already left"
Not Verified |  Our flight was supposed to be today: 3-16-25, after they had delayed it the previous day. That's not the problem. We could still make plans for and have a great experience. But the next day we checked the app and it said it has been delayed about 2 hours. That is fine, but a little worrisome. The boarding time was now officially set. 5:30pm boarding time. flight leaves at 6...  All of a sudden I get texted at 4:15 pm that day from breeze airways saying this exactly: "Flight #8819 to orlando fl is now boarding. Make your way to the gate 5, listen for your zone to be called, and enjoy the flight" naturally my family and I panicked as it was 4:15 and the app had just refreshed and now said "Boarding at 4:50. we had just made it in time to the airport, only to be greeted by breeze airways employee explaining to the 30 people who were in our same shoes that the plane had already left. We were left bamboozled, stopped in our tracks with no flight, essentially all of the flight's customers left in the erie airport entrance stunned. Zero out of ten. Do not fly with Breeze Airways.

### "Never booking again"
The customer service is extremely hard to get hold of. They don't have a phone number to call. My flight was delayed by conveniently only 2.5 hours because of "weather". However, other flights were not impacted and the weather in the affected area was completely clear. Conveniently, the cutoff for refund is 3 hours so I was not given a refund. Customer service over text was rude and did not answer any of my questions about rebooking/switching flights, but simply repeated "You will not get refunded. Thanks for understanding. Never booking again.

### “All were amazing!”
I’ve recently discovered Breeze Airways. As a loyal Southwest flyer, I was looking for an alternative. I’ve now flown them 2 times in the past month, and I must say each flight has been wonderful, mostly because of the flight attendants. Yesterday I flew from PWM to TPA via Charleston, the flight attendants were, Joanne, Patty & Robin. All were amazing! I’ve grown up in the airline business my entire life, so I can appreciate how to be treated. I’ll certainly make sure I check Breeze flights from now on, and hope these 3 are part of the crew. Thanks again ladies, Breeze Airways is so lucky to have you.

### "seems fundamentally dishonest"
Breeze offered an option to bid on an "expanded space" seat, which means they'll block the seat next to you. My flight was long, about 6 hours, so I bid because I thought the extra space would make my flight more comfortable. I received an email saying I won the bid, my credit card was charged, and I was even issued a boarding pass showing I had two seats reserved. So imagine my surprise when somebody came to sit next to me with a boarding pass for the "blocked" middle seat. Breeze did refund me the extra money I paid shortly after takeoff, but I would've preferred having the blocked seat. Nor did the airline apologize; when I complained, they simply noted that for operational reasons they can assign somebody else to the blocked seat. This seems fundamentally dishonest to me; if you're going to offer a bid system to block the seat next to you, and then tell someone they won the bid and collect the money from them, you shouldn't then sell the seat to somebody else. It's unfortunate because I have liked Breeze in the past and they offer some routes from my hometown which other airlines don't serve well, but this incident really made me think less of this airline, and I may hesitate to book them in the future.

### "joke of an airline"
Not Verified |  Flight was delayed 2 hours - whatever it happens. All 137 customers arrived on time waiting. 10 minutes before we are set to board, they make an announcement that the pilot has "timed out" and out flight is canceled. The employee who delivered this news could not have been more rude and insensitive ... it was 12:00 at night and many of us were left to figure out what to do on our own because conveniently enough for Breeze, their customer support was down. Next day rescheduled flight, the plane lands at the wrong terminal and we are forced to wait an additional two hours. Never fly this joke of an airline.

### "have to pay for our bags again"
When we checked a bag on the round trip to Orlando, there was no info on the site or after we bought the ticket that we would have to pay for our bags again on the return flight. The site also said we'd have a carryon included, but upon checking in, we were charged 50 for the big bag and 35 for the carryon. Upon checking in to the return flight, the very unfriendly and rude Breeze attendant said that we had to pay 75 for the big bag and 50 for the carryon. The price was more because we didn't add the bags using the app. We didn't know we had to pay for the bags both ways. The seats are horrible, the outlets to charge the phone don't work, no tv and not even water. If we wanted water or any beverage, we had to pay for it.

### "service response only made it worse"
We flew from Norfolk to new Orleans on February 23rd on flight mx 351 as a first time customer. Our flight was delayed because of a mechanical issue with their aircraft - their issue. We arrived in New Orleans after the rental car company closed and had to take a lyft / uber to and from the airport to get our rental car the next day which cost me $105.00 out of pocket. All we asked was that Breeze credit our ticket cost for the $105.00. There is no number to call them to explain so all communication is done through text. They claimed our delay did not meet their 1 hour 30 minute threshold by 2 minutes which was not accurate. We were delayed over 1 hour and 40 minutes. They don't get the cost and hassle they caused us and that their customer service response only made it worse. Their email communication during the delay was not complete and their second email late in the game reminded customers if they missed getting to TSA checkpoint by 9:00 pm - our flight was delayed till 11:00 pm - they would still not be able to make the delayed flight. I want to fly with people that care about me and do the right thing when they drop the ball. Breeze Airways are clearly not those people!

### "no star lack of care"
I have flown with Breeze Airways several time I found the flights to be fine plane is newer model with average comfort levels. Pilots are fine with good communication with passengers. Flight attendants are average level of service. The problems are at the beginning and the end of the flights. Desk personnel are rude at best in the Huntsville AL airport, no one is at the desk for up to 45 minutes after a flight. The 4 times that I’ve flown they have all been late anywhere from 30 minutes or up to an hour or more. This 2-day texting back and forth is at a minimum stupid and a waste of time. This is at best a $100.00 bag that should have been fixed or replaced. It’s an easy fix by breeze or about $100 to me and yet I am forced to do this long drawn out review of your airline. Direct flight to Las Vegas I give you a 4 star Comfort, I give you a 3.5 star Cost competitiveness I give you a 1 star no cheaper than Delta, AA or American 1 star Customer service, no star lack of care. This should have been taken care of in 3 days.

### "Will avoid flying with them now"
Not Verified |  Our flight was to arrive in Providence but was rerouted to Bradley in Connecticut due to wind. Totally understandable, however, if you chose not to reschedule flight, Breeze offered up to $150 for car rental, which now they claim they will not pay. Also, damaged luggage, which they won’t cover because they weren’t notified within 60 minutes. And we sat on the runway in Connecticut for 90 minutes. Couldn’t notify them of luggage damage due to now having to rush for rental car. So, we had to rent a car and drive 90 minutes to Providence, with our damaged luggage and they will do nothing. Very POOR! Also, you can not speak to a human. Zero on the Customer Service score. Will avoid flying with them now.

### "never fly Breeze again"
Breeze staff amazing to check in and fly with but when we had to be rerouted from landing in Richmond to Norfolk Va. The reimbursement form is not user friendly, you can't speak with a person; email answers generated. I will never fly Breeze again. I need customer service when the going gets tough; not emails; texts or just silence You team is amazing human contact).

### "do not care about their customers"
Absolutely horrific airline and I would recommend against using them. They do not care about their customers. To start, they delayed our flight 4 hours. We were traveling with our 7 month old. We got into Wilkesbarre, PA at almost midnight and we were trying to install the car seat we traveled with. Well after about 30 min of trying to get it into the car, we realized the reason we were having so much trouble is because the car seat base was damaged. I wasn't aware that you only have an hour after the landing time to submit a claim. Well I tried to explain to them the situation and the person I spoke with was rude and did not have any kind of compassion or empathy for our situation. Policies are policies that's fine. But this wasn't regular "baggage" this was our child's car seat. That is a safety issue. It's one thing to damage a bag - okay yeah that sucks but I could get over it. It's a whole other thing to damage something that is supposed to keep your baby safe in a vehicle. Please do not give this airline your money.

### “Not a great experience”
Not Verified | I flew from Scranton to Orlando twice. The fist time my flight was delayed for hours. The second time the flight was canceled because of a flat tire they couldn't repair, I needed to fly out the following day. On the return trip the changed the flight time. The flight wasn't going to get in until around midnight. Couldn't change the flight one-line to the next day. Had to get on a chat with Customer Sercvice. It took over an hour to rebook the flight. They did get the ticket changed. It took a long time on chat later at night. Not a great experience.

### “the very worst airline”
Breeze is absolutely the very worst airline you can fly. That said, they are also the cheapest. So if you don't care about service. And you don't care about the quality or comfort of your flight. And price is your only consideration that would be the only reason to fly Breeze.

### "Breeze then refused to honor this"
Not Verified |  The Breeze gate agent along with two other Breeze employees voluntarily told my cancelled flight, hotel and transportation would be reimbursed for non local guests. Breeze then refused to honor this. They also neglected to rebook guests flying to Tampa on the makeup flight the next day when told we would be. I spent an hour and half with a Breeze agent the next day trying to get a hold of customer service to rebook me. Me nor the agent could get a hold of their customer service so they suggested I book on another airline which I did.

### "Breeze never again"
Not Verified | Dont do it. I had some reasonable experiences flying Breeze before, so we took the chance of flying Breeze out of New Haven, CT - a new route for Breeze. This airport is ill equipped to handle the number of flights that it does and is a terrible check in experience. we arrived more than 1h 30 early with ONLY carry on bags and still were unable to make the gate in time. we werent the only ones that were left behind. upon booking a different route with different flight with a different airline. I figured there would be an opportunity to be credited back the money to use for a different time, but was told after multiple attempts they can cannot credit my account. Completely unreasonable given the situation and Incompetence with TSA delays and Breeze staff. I would have expected some better customer service. Had I known there would be no flexibility, I would've cancelled and left the airport prior to the boarding process. To make matters worse, they have a text only support line. Just a disaster. I will happliy pay Avelo for future flights. Breeze never again.

### "Will never book again"
Not Verified |  First off the flight was delayed by 2.5 hours then we sat on the plane for additional 2 hours waiting for fuel. Fly Breeze only if you want delays, cancellations and other things no other reputable airline offers. 0/10 Will never book again.

### "Will never fly them again"
Not Verified |  Flight was delayed - totally fine, it happens. Arrived at desk 1.5 hours before new boarding time. No one was at the check in gate to take my checked bags I paid for in advance. Could not be reached at the gate from information desk. Had to leave my baggage and a car seat behind with my husband who was staying in NC while my daughter and I flew home as it was the last flight of the evening. No refund. No explanation. (insert angry word) their automated system. Will never fly them again

### "I won't be flying Breeze again"
Not Verified |  My family and I had a Breeze flight from New Orleans to Raleigh/Durham scheduled to leave at 8 am on Saturday, January 4th. We arrived at the gate at 6:40 and all boards said the flight was on time. Around 7:30 am, there was an announcement the flight was canceled. There were few alternatives so we rented a car and drove 14 hours to home. There were no personnel at the gate so impossible to get answers. Was there no plane? No staff? I won't be flying Breeze again.

### "worst experience I’ve ever had"
Not Verified |  They are supposed to accept checked bags for flights up until 45 minutes before departure. I got there 1.5 hours early, waited in like for 30 minutes for them to tell me that they stopped accepting bags and that I wouldn’t be able to check my bag. I still had an hour until my flight left. This caused me to miss my flight because I can’t just leave my bag at the airport. And the employee was fully yelling at me while I was trying to be calm and respectful and just ask why they stopped accepting bags 15 minutes early. They then proceeded to take off early. The worst experience I’ve ever had with an airline, they looked understaffed which sucks but that is not an excuse to just disregard the rules.

### “lower fare is not worth this aggravation”
I will NEVER fly this airline again. First class does not provide early checked bags or a first class line. In addition, you have to send your bags through security yourself. Twice now, the employees at the gate are late to start checking in passengers, well under 2 hours before flights leave. I waited in line over an HOUR to check in. They repeatedly called other flights to “skip the line”. I patiently waited. I finally get to my turn only to be turned away because I was “too early”. I was 90 minutes until boarding. The agent then got snippy when I dared complain about waiting in line and the flight boarding less than 2 hours. They forced me out of line and made a scene putting me in my place. Moral of the story is sleep in and show up late. They will pull you out of the obnoxious lines, reward the late owls and make you skip the line anyway. At this point, the lower fare is not worth this aggravation. I won’t be flying this airline again.

### "Fantastic experience from beginning to end!"
Absolutely a fantastic experience from beginning to end! Wonderful and amazing people who work here, from having your bags checked to the stewardesses on the plane. We flew from New Haven to Palm Beach, Florida, and the captain and his crew were absolutely top-notch! On our way to Florida the staff provided an amazing experience. Very funny and entertaining, welcoming each of us onto the plane and ensuring we were ready for an epic experience with top-notch service and a smile. Drinks and snacks that were more than just nice—they were amazing! The seats are extremely comfortable, and we opted for the "Nicer" option for $80, which included a suitcase and travel bag, extra legroom, and free WiFi—all for $80! If you’re looking for a fantastic airline, this is without a doubt a phenomenal choice. By the way, in First Class, you get even larger seats, the ability to put your feet up, and free alcohol for about $130! On our return flight from Palm Beach back to New Haven, our pilot greeted all of us once we were boarded. The plane ran a little late coming in due to a coyote on the runway and a couple of mechanical issues that were quickly fixed. The pilot was warm and charming—I’ve never seen a pilot speak to passengers and apologise for the delay and he was full of smiles and charm. His crew was consistently on top of their game, ensuring we had everything we needed. These planes are clean, and I think the bathrooms are even larger. 100% there’s no doubt that Breeze wants your business and is doing everything to make your experience amazing. We will be back for sure! Thank you, Breeze Airlines!

### "Very unsatisfied"
Not Verified |  Breeze Airways did not allow me to check in prior to flight to Tampa as it did when I went to PA. They charged me $300 when it was out of my hands to check in prior to flight. They have no one you can talk to but send an email. $300 was my charge again for just luggage of course they sell you a cheap flight and then block your confirmation number so you can’t check in to them you what they want. Very unsatisfied. In these times this is a rip off!

### "never fly with them again"
Not Verified | I have flown with Breeze two times and I will never fly with them again. Both times I had bad experiences and I fly at least 2-4 times a month having no issues with other airlines.

### "Very disappointed"
Not Verified |  Extremely dysfunctional check in at RSW. Quick diversion to PVD on our one way flight to HVN. Might leave in an hour or three. Stay nearby". Guess we don't have a choice since they won't release our bags. Sad part is we could Uber to HVN and be home before this plane ever leaves PVD. Very disappointed. Nice new one, but not nice enough to go through this.

### "get their act together and survive"
This is our time experience with Breeze Airways and while it was not a great experience, we do hope this airline gets their house in order and can survive. We like competition and alternative carriers. We are at the airport finishing dinner with almost 15 minutes to spare before boarding begins….and I receive the following text. This is the final boarding call for Flight #741 to Fort Myers, FL. Please come directly to gate A17, as doors will be closing soon. WTF. We sprint to the gate in panic to learn that they decided to try to leave early despite over a dozen passengers not yet boarding. My daughter holds up the flight and luckily everyone is able to make the flight. There was no overhead announcement, update via the app, just this terse text that boarding is closing. Along these lines we also noted that their tech is buggy. We could only pull up our reservations via an email link and not via normal app lookup. When clicking on the link it opens in the app. Thats bad tech. My daughter also found that gaining access to the free SMS service also gave her free internet access. That’s also bad tech and makes you wonder how secure the rest of their systems are. We hope this airline can get their act together and survive but for now…be careful.

### “100% of the flights were disrupted”
Breeze is THE WORST airline in history. We travel 50+ flights per year. We have booked 5 flights with Breeze. ALL 5 fights delayed many hours and then cancelled. Yup, 100% of the flights were disrupted. Today's flight, delayed hours of course, and when we got to the airport, TSA was closed. Despite the fact that the aircraft had not even gotten to the airport yet! The TSA agent was just leaving, and said he had to close "because Breeze wouldn't pay for TSA overtime" for the late flight. So two $125 Uber trips, to and from the airport, plus hotel, plus meals, plus another Uber tomorrow, plus expensive last minute tickets on JetBlue. And of course no one at the Breeze counter at the airport, and no phone number for Breeze. Yup, no way to contact these thieves! NEVER AGAIN with Breeze.

### "A truly terrible experience"
A truly terrible experience followed by an interaction with a support team that could not care less about the experience of their customers. They delayed more than three hours, then pushed off from the gate only to sit right in front of the gate for another 20 minutes before taxiing. They did this so that people could not choose to get refunds and book elsewhere. Paid $400 for a once way flight hoping for convenience, and they only issued 5% credit, not even a refund. DO NOT FLY WITH THEM.

### "extremely unfair"
Not Verified | I got my bag from baggage claim and it was absolutely destroyed. Nobody was working to report it to. Then another worker came out from the back and said nobody was there and I’ll have to go online and report. So I took photos in front of the belt for proof. Phone died and it took an hour to get home. After I reported it a couple of days later, they said they will not reimburse me because I didn’t report it within an hour - well Breeze maybe if you had someone working, I could have reported it. And to say only an hour after, when people have to travel that long just to get home to get a charge on their phone to go online and report it. That’s extremely unfair. I’ll probably never book with this airline company ever again.

### "our relationship is now over"
My problem isn't my flight experiences with Breeze. My problem is that today I purchased a round trip plane ticket (attached). And only a few hours later, I get a text saying that my reservation has been rescheduled to dates that don't work for me. But the flights I booked have not been rescheduled they are still happening. But I can't fly on those dates now unless I pay over $300 more. And of course getting a "refund" barely gets me half of what I originally paid. How is this legal? I have flown breeze many times, but our relationship is now over.

### “I’m appalled by this treatment”
The desk agents were extremely rude and dismissive when I approached them with a question. One waved me away as I tried to explain that I had mistakenly added a carry-on to my booking. When I mentioned that the online chat was unhelpful and wouldn’t allow me to finish my sentence the issue, she dismissed me before I could even finish my sentence. I’m appalled by this treatment. Despite flying with Breeze regularly, I lost $40 for a service I neither used nor received. They are quick to take your money for a bag but offer no way to resolve mistakes. This feels like theft. Disappointing.

### "Absolutely fabulous experience"
Absolutely fabulous experience from beginning to end. Beautiful brand-new spotless aircraft, friendly, professional crew. Positively thrilled to have a non-stop from Maine to Sarasota, FL. Please don't ever take this flight route away! What a joy to go wheels up to wheels down in 3 hours vs having to travel more than half of the day chasing connections. Will definitely fly Breeze as often as possible. *The only reason I gave wifi/inflight entertainment one star is you have to pay for it. Most airlines are now free onboard wifi, so hopefully Breeze will consider this as well.

### "Would fly Breeze again"
Not Verified |  First class is brand new and clean! Big comfy seats, nice choice of menu items, good pricing. Only downside is that I walked in and sat down at my seat 1f to see a bee sitting in my window (I’m petrified of bee’s). The flight attendant came and oops theres another bee. Sorry another bee came again inside the door to my seat. As I was saying the flight attendant was nice and took care of the situation. Would fly Breeze again.

### “couldn’t have been happier”
We had our first trip from Scranton/Wilkes-Barre, Pa to Fort Myers, Fl, on the new Breeze Airlines, and couldn’t have been happier! I think the first and most notable observation was the friendliness of the staff. Everyone, from the ticket counter to flight attendants, and forward were some of the nicest people we have dealt with on any airline travel. The plane was very clean, and although “extra legroom” is very subjective, it was fine. I hope the schedule from Wilkes-Barre continues, and hopefully increases, because it’s the way I will travel from here on.

### "yet another delay"
First time me and my family flew Breeze Airways in July 2024 was fantastic. On time, flight attendants were great, and smooth direct flight. 2nd time in September the flight was delayed. Very upsetting when have plans and have to change things for a quick weekend visit to my son in SC. Then my daughter and her boyfriend flew Breeze to the same destination from Pgh and their flight was delayed 4 hrs ...  then ultimately canceled. No help whatsoever to get them connected on another airline. Now flying this evening with family and just got a notification of yet another delay. No more Breeze airways flights for me. This is ridiculous.

### “never encountered such terrible service”
I had a really great experience on this airline, this was my first time riding Breeze. I arrived an hour before the flight and missed the check bag time and couldn’t get on the plane. I texted customer service and they responded timely, even though missed flights aren’t covered, they were really understanding about my situation and gave me a refund in the form of a flight credit to take the next available flight. When I finally got a flight (it was an hour and a half flight) and we arrived 30 mins early to the destination. The plane was very clean (seemed basically brand new) the flight attendants were all very kind, the plane ride was very smooth. Overall it was a really great experience and the tickets were very affordable.

### "worst airline I have ever flown"
Breeze is the worst airline I have ever flown. 5 hour delay and a huge attitude from customer service when I could find them. I had to spend a bunch of money on airport food and extend my parking. The real kicker was the additional hour on the tarmac. I agreed to leave my preferred seat to rearrange the weight. After all of this the flight attendant still charged me for a drink. I will never fly them again. I’d rather have a layover.

### "Don't trust your checked bags"
Not Verified |  Don't trust your checked bags! After preparing to hike the Grand Canyon for a year, Breeze Airways lost my baggage and hiking equipment. Finding anyone from the airline to help was very hard, and they were rude. Because there is no phone number to call, your only options are Facebook or email - no help for a customer. After more than two hours in the airport, first trying to locate anyone and then working through a process to report the loss, my bag was identified as lost. After more than five weeks, the only response I have from the airline is that my bag was lost and is under review. They cannot even provide me with a date when they will address my loss. What a great way to spend the adventure of a lifetime.

### "not be flying with Breeze again"
After struggling with accessing Breeze links due to server issues on their end and no luck in contacting their customer service department, I attempted to ask front desk gate attendants for assistance with checking into my flight and using my points to check my bag. They immediately cut me off from completing my inquiry, refused and offered no options other than paying their $75 baggage fee. (In the policy, but I stated that I’d keep trying the website as I had for a while with no luck as other Breeze staff was able to access my account in the past.) The bag was eventually checked before entering TSA but while waiting for boarding I was approached and asked if my issue was resolved to which I said yes because the bag discussed was checked and on the plane. Staff escalated the issue, demanded I pay another $75 for my purse, yelled at me, denied me and my mother boarding, stated that I was disruptive and unsafe, and proceeded to call airport security. It took days to receive a response from Breeze and even then they never apologized for the behavior of their staff nor offered any kind of consolation. If you enjoy poor customer service, janky websites and links, waiting 3 days for a customer service response, and cheap flights, then Breeze is perfect for you! My family and I will not be flying with Breeze again after this encounter.

### "complete indifference to passengers"
Flight MX117 schedule: leave Richmond 6:58 pm 10/26/24, arrive Tampa 9:14 pm Saturday 10/26/24 8:06 am get message: leave Richmond 12:49 am 10/27/24, arrive Tampa 3:05 am no mention of any TSA restrictions Saturday 10/26/24 12:20 pm get message Please arrive at the airport no later than 9:45 pm. (apparently TSA is not staffed after that time.) My question—If TSA is not there, how can Breeze schedule a flight at 12:49 am? Assuming I got through TSA at 9:00 pm, am I expected to sit for almost 4 hours waiting for the flight to depart--I’m 84 years old. Saturday 10/26/24 7:19 pm get message (I’m already on the road to the airport so I can be there before 9:45): Please arrive at the airport no later than 9:15 pm. (apparently now TSA is not staffed after that new time.) So now I have 30 minutes less than what I planned on? And now I can wait for almost 4 ½ hours to depart? Saturday 10/26/24 7:30-8:30 pm: Massive accident on Rt 64 on the way to the airport. Sit for 50-60 minutes before reaching an exit. Try to use Breeze app on my iPhone. Find it impossible to cancel flight, or to schedule another flight. App is totally useless, and of course there’s no phone call possible! In desperation call my daughter, who from her home computer manages to cancel our whole trip. She gets us on a flight with Southwest. Thank heaven we weren’t relying on Breeze to get us to a connecting flight, or to a Sunday wedding, or to leave on a cruise, etc! To force people to accept a revised flight at an ungodly departure and arrival time (which is exactly what I was trying to avoid), to not inform them of TSA problems before asking then to accept a change, to make them sit for hours in an airport because of TSA problems, to have a useless app, to have no provision for talking to a human (especially in an emergency), to give such short notice on change in TSA hours—totally unacceptable, and reflects complete indifference to passengers and total incompetence in management. What I want: I have 25000 Breeze points. I would like $250 refunded, since I have no intention of flying on Breeze, ever! Breeze has the money I originally paid when I got the 25000 points; based on the “service” I got, it’s not right that Breeze should be able to keep my money and give me nothing; I repeat, nothing, in return. Also, when I printed my boarding pass and saw the seating chart, it appeared that flight MX117 was only half full. Although I can’t prove it, I suspect that we were bumped to the later flight so that flight would be full. After all, if there was a mechanical problem, was there no other plane? If the pilot was ill, was there no other pilot? The weather was perfect in both Richmond and Tampa, so that wasn’t an issue.

### “Absolute horrific experience”
Absolute horrific experience with Breeze. My flight from Lansing to Orlando was delayed ~7 hours. On my return flight, I was emailed asking to show up to the airport early because TSA lines were expected to be extra long. They were not. I got through them in under 20 minutes. I am now sitting at the gate and we are again delayed multiple hours with no end in sight. They don't have a customer assistance telephone number. What an absolute joke of an airline. Never again.

### “Customer service is awful”
Not Verified | This is the 2nd time we tried to fly Breeze and the 2nd time our flight was cancelled at the gate. So disappointed for ruining my son’s 10 year old birthday weekend. We were notified by text the flight was canceled and no one even came to the gate to tell the passengers. We had to exit the gated area and go to arrivals to get some help. Help was take the refund because we have no other options today. Customer service is awful, you can’t call for help and your flights don’t actually take off. I haven’t received my refund as of yet.

### "This will be the last time"
Breeze offers a Sunday flight from Tampa to Norfolk, but our experience is that the odds of the flight actually taking place on that day are less than 50%. My wife and I are both medical professionals, and our presence at our jobs on Monday morning is required. Breeze has caused major difficulties for us more than once. This will be the last time.

### “Customer service is a joke”
Not Verified | Breeze has to be the worst airline I have ever flown. The company started out great in 2020 and ever since then it has reached rock bottom. Customer service is a joke, delays are 3 plus hours when minimum prior notification, cancelations are frequent. You sit at the airport for hours and then they text you and say the flight was canceled. They offer 150 airline credit forcing you to have to buy another ticket from this horrendous airline instead of putting that credit towards the method of payment. This airline doesn't even seem yo try. You can not talk to a physical person. The source of communication is via text which is probably AI. If I could give this airline a negative 100 I would.

### "I had an awful experience"
Not Verified | I had an awful experience with Breeze Airlines. They destroyed my luggage, and to make matters worse, they refused to offer any compensation. The customer service is practically non-existent — only available via text messages, and it takes 2-3 days for them to even respond. When they finally do, they’re rude and unprofessional, almost as if they’re mocking you instead of offering real help. I can’t believe how badly they treat their customers. I will never fly with them again and strongly advise others to avoid this airline at all costs.

### "never able to talk to a live person"
Not Verified | Breeze Airways has a terrible online website. You are never able to talk to a live person. They promise you through emails things like points for canceled flights or long delays, but then they don't provide the points and won't assist in helping you get onto their online programs for points or reimbursement. This company has absolutely no customer relations identity. It is like talking to an AI Bot that just dead ends you when you have an issue. The people at the airport are not there two hours prior to take-off and do not help with any issues you have with the company. This feels like a bubble-gum company. I won't be using them again out of fear that if I ever needed to speak to somebody about a refund for a canceled flight or some financial consideration for a delayed flight, nobody, nobody, nobody picks up.

### "airline was not helpful in re-booking"
Not Verified | We had an emergency landing due to an electrical fire/ or smoke in the cockpit that resulted in a 12 hour delay. The airline was not helpful in re-booking flights and chose to refund some guests while not refunding others. The emergency landing was quite scary. I would not feel safe flying this airline again.

### "would not refund or rebook my flight"
The planes themselves are fine, the fares are reasonable, the in-flight attendants are friendly. But the organizational policies and customer service is poor. I booked a flight with Breeze, and ten hours later needed to cancel the flight because my father was dying. I reached out to their customer service agent and explained the situation. They informed me that I would not be given a credit or a refund, because I did not purchase their flight insurance ("flexible fare"). Instead they gave a flight voucher for 20% of the original cost (and this was only awarded because I cancelled within 24 hours of my purchase). I reached out them after my father's passing (a week later), and explained I would be happy to provide a death certificate and that I could pay for their insurance retroactively if that's really what they needed to cancel my flight and give me a full refund. They refused to work with me, and said I was awarded the proper amount. So to summarize: I booked a flight, my father passed away, I tried to cancel the flight only 10 hours after purchasing, I offered to provide the death certificate, and Breeze would not refund or rebook my flight. There are a lot of words that could be used to describe this interaction. Greedy", "low-class", "inflexible", and "careless" are a few.

### "lost confidence in this airline"
Not Verified | Can't complain about my experience with my flight I noted. It's the Breeze web site ever since. What a mess! Nothing makes sense, I can't find flights. Here's an idea, once I enter my departure location. ONLY list the cities you actually fly to. Also, how about showing the dates that are available? Here's another idea, stop with the bombardment of email with these low fares when you NEVER actually offer any at these low prices? Last Idea, people fly with luggage, people don't fly standing up! Why not just list the actual price of the ticket. Sorry, I lost confidence in this airline - going back to the reliable ones...

### "would not even consider even credit"
Not Verified |  Flight to Fort Myers delayed several hours due to a maintenance issue where we just sat on the plane for hours after boarding early. Got in a horrible accident that landed us in the hospital and the airline would not even consider even credit for missing our flight home to Charles bc we were unable to notify them within an hour of flight taking off due to our extenuating circumstances… needless to say, we will not be using this airline in the future!

### “pretty distasteful and rude to customers”
The fact of the matter is it is a great price to travel and if all you care about is saving money, you're golden with Breeze. Me personally, I also care about comfort and an amount of respect from your crew. My plane took off at around 11:45 pm from Denver International and is heading toward TF Green in Providence, RI, with plans to arrive at around 6 am EST. My seat, just called extra legroom seat, had plenty of legroom but no under seat storage at all (overall that's okay though because you board with zone 1 and there's still plenty of overhead space). Crew come on and are talking about how we are flying a red eye flight and will make it as comfortable as possible by limiting the overhead announcements to respect sleepers and passing by sleeping people during service. At around 1 am, the crew get on the intercom to try to sell you a credit card for 5 minutes then begin service selling overpriced food and practically yelling for anyone who has their eyes even moderately open if they are interested in service, which I found pretty distasteful and rude to customers. All the while, at least 2 steward/stewardesses hang out up front talking full blast and laughing with no regard for the sleeping people they said fhey would try to be mindful of. I am not saying they should be absolutely silent, but I shouldn't be able to wake up from sleeping because you're cackling at a joke I could make out all the words to from 5 rows back.

### “refused to refund money”
Not Verified | Terrible. Canceled our flight twice and refused to refund money back to original payment. They also said they would reimburse $150 per ticket for expenses incurred but said my cost for the air b&b I was unable to use didn’t qualify.

### “No online support”
Not Verified | Where to start? No online support! No chat for questions, Online site freeze up. No pricing as advertised. Very difficult to find dates. Flight calendar very unstable and difficult.

### "Twice tried to book flights"
Not Verified |   Twice tried to book flights on Breeze,  a trip to Calif. in 2023. Flight was cancelled less than two weeks before scheduled departure. Had to scramble to find flights. Second a trip to Orlando on Oct. of 2024. Flight was re scheduled from 6:15am to 4:45pm. This ruined other planned events for that day. Fortunately was able to re book on another airline and salvage my plans. Sadly as excited as I was about trying their Nicest service and new aircraft I don't think I'll be trying Breeze again. Had to select a date that I flew on Breeze. Never got the chance was not an option.

### "no customer service"
Not Verified | Immediately after booking the flight I realized I had chosen the wrong return date I've spent a month trying to reach a customer service when you click on the link it sends you a text that takes you back to the same page on the website so you're essentially a dog chasing your tail there's no customer service no one to help you. I've been trying to cancel the flight so I can rebook I followed every step I set up an account I tried to link it it is all very difficult actually impossible.

### "customer service is terrible"
Breeze treated my son who is in the US Coast Guard terribly. I dropped him off at the airport in San Diego to go to Connecticut on orders and they did not accept his 3rd checked bag. He has never experienced this with any other airline. He missed his flight and had to book on American for much later. Thankfully American honors people serving in our military and will take his extra bag. My son tried to pay for a 3rd checked bag, but they refused to take cash (he didn't have a credit card on him). And I'm trying to get a refund for the Breeze flight now but they literally have no one that you can talk to and the customer service in general is terrible. Don't fly this airline.

### "nothing but issues, delays"
Is it cheap? Yep. Will you get to where you need to go on time? Probably not. I’ve experienced almost nothing but issues, delays, and vacations ruined because of breeze. More often than not (I’ve flown breeze 4-5 times now) your flight WILL get delayed into the late night, cut your trip short, and inconvenience you and/or your family. Twice now, I’ve had to purchase a separate ticket with a different airline just to make it to where I need to be the same day. I understand things like weather are uncontrollable but all instances I’ve experienced delays and trips cut short are because of breeze was for “last minute repairs” ? ? I recommend you spend the extra $50-$100 on an airline who won’t ruin your trip every time you fly with them!

### "not a reliable airline"
Not Verified |  Breeze is not a reliable airline. Family and friends who come to visit are usually delayed anywhere from 2 hours to 2 days (and then cancelled the trip). If you must be somewhere on a certain day-you cannot fly Breeze. It is not a low cost airline. By the time you add up fees for carryons, checked luggage and seat selection it is the same or more than the legacy carriers. Just giving the public a heads up

### "luggage cost more than a passenger?"
Not Verified |  I booked a flight for my wife from Islip to Richmond and back. No luggage or seat. Cost $108 round trip. When she got to the airport because there was limited space in the overhead and she was the last one to board, she had to check a small carry on the same carry on I took to Vegas N/C. She literally just had a laptop and folders in it. Cost $75. She will be charged another $75 on the way back if there's limited space again. Since when does luggage cost more than a passenger? So $108 for the flight and $150 for the luggage in cargo. What a great airline. I emailed the CEO. Waiting to hear back from him.

### "consistent in its lack of customer care"
Not Verified |   Prior to arriving at LAX, my family and I were notified that we would have to check in at one terminal and then take a shuttle bus to another for departure. We were not told that we would then have to walk/run the length of the terminal in order to reach the gate. Our baggage was checked in on time, which confirmed our arrival at LAX and that we were on our way to the departure gate. This guaranteed our right to board our flight, in accordance with the "Flat Tyre" rule. The TSA security check was slow, due to a large number of passengers, but we were assured by LAX staff that we would definitely make our flight. A gentleman with whom we spoke while lining up arrived at the bus after we did. We arrived at the departure gate before he did: at 12.35, precisely ten minutes before our flight was due to take off. We were told abruptly that we had been "offloaded". We assumed the person at the gate, who told us this, was a Breeze representative. Her demeanour was rude, and it took some time for her to reveal that she was, in fact, an LAX employee. After we had explained that our delay was not our fault, she consented to talk to her manager, disappearing behind the doors which led to the airplane. She did not emerge for some time and we felt that this was an avoidance and stalling tactic, designed to deter or further delay us until the plane took off. It did: at 12.50: five minutes late, and fifteen minutes after we had arrived at the gate. A family, with four children- the youngest of whom was only two months- were also prevented from boarding the plane, despite having arrived five minutes before us. The same gentleman mentioned earlier arrived at the gate after us, but was allowed on to his flight, scheduled to leave only five minutes after ours. As we waited for the LAX employee to return, another couple arrived at our gate. It was left to us to tell them to join the line for that same flight. We watched them board their flight as we were prevented from boarding our own. Two flights departed from the same gate within one minute of each other. Flight Closed" showed on the screens- for both flights, and, yet, the passengers on the other flight were allowed to board their flight. Additional time was lost, due to the confusion of having to figure out which line to join. At no point did we hear our names called, or a "Final Boarding" call, probably because we were on the shuttle bus when- or if- announcements were made. We were repeatedly reassured by LAX staff that we would make our flight, and then shocked by the obstructive and confrontational behaviour of the LAX employee at the desk. I have traveled both domestically and internationally for over forty years. This is the first time I have arrived at a departure gate that is not staffed or overseen by the carrier itself. I see this as a dereliction of duty. By handing over responsibility to airport employees, Breeze is placing passengers- to whom it is ethically and legally obligated to provide the highest quality of service possible- to a third party who cares nothing for either passengers or the airline. My family and I were forced to delay our journey and take another flight that night, with American Airlines. Breeze's "customer service" is anything but. Its purpose is to justify the company's unprofessionalism and corporate greed. After having sent three emails, I was told by them that I would not receive a further response. Breeze is consistent in its lack of customer care. Never again.

### "unprofessional, irresponsible, and unacceptable"
Our scheduled flight at 715 am was delayed for maintenance indefinitely when we arrived at the gate at 6:40 am. No notification was provided until we were actually supposed to depart. Ok, things happen, we can be patient. They continued to post updates (30 minutes late) throughout the morning. At 9:15 am the staff at the gate announce the plane WILL NOT be leaving before 2:00 pm. The plane required a part to be delivered to Tampa from Providence. They explained 2:00 pm would be best case scenario but it could be as late as 7:00 or 9:00 in the evening. Their message was very negatively toned and sounded somewhat hopeless. The gate staff advised we could request a refund or rebook via the email we received. They also stated we should feel free to leave the airport and monitor the status and return in the afternoon. I saw many people re-booking, cancelling, and leaving. I live locally so I spoke to two different gate staff to confirm the plane would not be leaving before 2:00 pm. Both confirmed but said an evening departure is more likely. So I decided, as did many others to take their advice and monitor the status and plan to return in the afternoon based on the information they provided “the plane will not leave before 2:00 pm”. Well, we left at 9:45 and 40 minutes later we received an updated departure time of 10:45 am. I didn’t think it could be legit bc of the multiple conversations I had with gate staff. I actually expected another update since they had been issuing delayed updates all morning. It was legit, and my daughters and I missed the flight to see their grandfather for the weekend. No other flight options and no compensation offered. I can’t begin to imagine the internal communication disconnect that would allow for gate staff to inform us of the delay information, advise us to leave if we wish, only to have the plane depart an hour later! It’s completely unprofessional, irresponsible, and unacceptable! Someone needs to be held accountable for this incident that affected many people’s lives.

### "Cheerful, helpful staff"
Not Verified |   First time fliers - we’ll absolutely be back. Cheerful, helpful staff, highly efficient check in. Onboard team were superb. Seats were spacious and very comfortable. Well done!

### "I was very pleased with their service"
First time I have flown on Breeze (I am a Delta Frequent Flyer. Delta doesn't fly to KPBG). I was very pleased with their service, their efficiency, their crew communication. From top to bottom they were great. I sat in Seat 3A which is part of their "Ascent" seating assignment. Just think First Class on an A220 if they had one. When I was leaving KPBG, there was an issue with the inbound aircraft so they was a significant delay. Breeze communicated flawlessly about the delay and when to expect the aircraft to be en route. It updated passengers every 30 min. You'd be hard pressed to have the Legacy giants communicate half that! The icing on the cake, because of the delay, they awarded 5,000 extra miles to my Breeze account. Overall, I was extremely pleased and will be flying Breeze again!

### "I'm done with Breeze"
Not Verified |   I've traveled 5 round trip flights on Breeze, of the ten legs nine have been delayed. The crews on all the flights are above average and professional, I wish I could say the same for the people at the check in counter, most seem ill trained and short on patience. The planes are all newer, less than four years in service and clean. The first class seats are above average and a price value compared to other airlines. This past weekend they lost a suitcase but found it the next day but unlike other airlines they refused to send it to our house and made us drive 40 minutes to the airport, park, go into the airport to retrieve the lost bag. Its a trade off, if you don't mind being 5 hours delayed on your flight and god help you if they lose your luggage this might be a airline for you. I'm done with Breeze

### "more relaxing than I expected"
I almost did not keep this booking because I started reading reviews about Breeze that scared me to death. But then I read reviews for other airlines like United, which is the one we have flown most recently, and I saw that they were similar, so I thought it would be safe to give it a try. I hate flying in general because I don’t like being crowded and squished into my seat by the person next to me. This is not a problem on the 32 configuration for these airplanes and it makes all the difference in the world. The seats still don’t have very much Incline, but that’s standard across all airlines now. Everyone was courteous and the flights were on time and uneventful so they were actually more relaxing than I expected.

### "willing to try them again"
Not Verified |   Was happy to find a nonstop flight LAX-JAX flying T/Th/Sun. Booked 6 round trip economy seats for my family Th-Sun (all adults). 6 weeks prior to our departure Breeze changed our outgoing flight to a 2 day earlier departure. This didn’t work for us. Breeze did make it very easy to cancel online and I received a refund immediately but it left us searching for new flights 6 weeks prior to departure date which were now significantly more expensive. We kept the return flight. Our return flight on Breeze was great. Boarding went very fast, seats were more comfortable than the UA planes we flew in on, charging ports worked. Our plane had a 3/2 configuration which meant none of us had a middle seat. There was no WiFi or screens but knew that in advance and willing to sacrifice for a non stop. Very little was complimentary but also were prepared for that. We left on time, staff was courteous and came through a few times. I would be willing to try them again for the convenience and time savings of a non stop route. We had other family meeting in JAX from west coast on AA and their trip was an absolute nightmare both directions. Our UA flight was delayed a few hours. It feels like we are choosing the lesser of evils these days.

### "this is not first class service"
Paid for “first class” which I believe is Ascent on Breeze. One hour 40 min flight. Flight attendant came and asked if I would like a drink within 10 minutes after takeoff… she brought my drink and then we never saw her again the rest of the flight. I sat with my garbage, wanting a snack and another drink the rest of the flight. The few times she left her Jump seat in the front of the plane were to stock her bags that she took from the overhead bins and to heat her food that she had brought with her to eat. Unfortunately for this airline, the seats justify a more expensive ticket but this is not first class service, not even close. I’ve had better service in main cabin on all of the major airlines

### "Worse flying experience of my life"
Not Verified | Worse flying experience of my life. They lie until the last minute before just canceling. First flight delayed almost 8 hrs. 2nd flight canceled all together, after several delays. First and last time flying with this airline they. They take your money then treat you like trash. Just go ahead and fold Breeze because clearly you all have no clue what a real airline is.

### "delayed by a day and a half"
Our flight was delayed by a day and a half because of a problem with the airplane. They offered no compensation for the cost of the extra night we had to spend in a hotel. They informed us that it was because they gave us at least 12 hours notice to make other flight arrangements. It's the only airline that flies into our local airport so the only other arrangements we could have made would be to fly into an airport 98 miles away and pay for a car to drive us back to the local airport where we were parked. Either option cost us money for an issue that was their fault.

### "wouldn't let us on the flight"
Worst service ever. We arrived to the gate (with 4 children 7 and under) 11 minutes prior to departure and they wouldn't let us on the flight. They were actually 5 minutes delayed so we arrived 16 minutes before departure. On top of that, they offered no help for a different flight and no refund. They have no partnerships with other airlines to offer other options. There is no phone call support (only text) and no on site help at the airport. I ended up booking another flight with American Airlines for tonight. I will never use Breeze again.

### "no longer have our business"
This is our 4th time flying Breeze. The first time was great! Good service, on time flights, all good! 2nd time, was okay. Upcharged us $40 for one of our bags being slightly overweight. 3rd time was not good at all! When we arrived at the airport, while checking in, the customer service lady said "you know this flight is delayed by 2 hours" Nope, didn't hear that. And sure enough, as we are standing there a text alert comes through my phone. This flight is delayed for "scheduled maintenance that is taking longer than anticipated. Brings me to today, our 4th time with Breeze. Get a text at 1:30am that our flight is delayed 3 hours for, you guessed it ... "scheduled maintenance that is taking longer than anticipated. So our 10:10am flight was moved to 1:10pm. 3 hours, not the end of the world, we can adjust. Nope! Just received another text that our flight is now moved to 5:30pm (no explanation on this one). Booking a morning flight, we anticipated having time at our destination. Now, a whole day gone! Asked about compensation. They said I will not know until the flight has taken off. We shall see. Stay tuned, we may not get out today. I will update review if anything else changes. When 3 out of 4 trips have been disrupted, that's not a very good average. Batting .250 gets you sent to the minors. Sorry Breeze, you will no longer have our business!

### "wont ever fly Breeze Airways again"
I flew with Breeze in business class and it was decent. They have 3 options to choose from and of course if you go with the cheapest option you get less. The cheapest option does not allow seat selection or a carry-on bag. I booked again and I was told that I have to pay an additional $299 for my infant to have her own seat! The agent with their customer service company was rude and it's a company that serves many airlines. He said that he needed my email address and my Breeze account password to look into the matter. I was not comfortable with that. I wont ever fly Breeze Airways again!

### "I will NOT fly with them again"
Not Verified | Will start the story and hopefully can do in 3500 words. Started at 2 am this morning, received text of a 1 hour delay, followed by we need to bump 22 people (plane holds 140 ish). After looking up they had a hardware change from A320 to a E190. By 8 am, we were up to a 2 hour delay, 10 am, sent email that there was a “fueling issue” that caused the delay. Still nothing of a hardware change. Got to the airport, they checked people in, took their bags. Then at 11:30 (for a 12:30 flight) started calling names of the lucky ones that were bumped. 12:10 plane arrived. Now, this was an old school flight - started in Connecticut, there were people on board that were traveling through to Orlando. 12:15, everyone off the plane. No explanation, those people confused. 1:05. Pilot comes off the plane, “we had a bird strike on landing, we have been waiting for the mechanic, he hasn’t showed up yet”. Appreciate he actually said something. 1:15, saw the mechanic. Walked to the plane with a small bag that could barely hold his roll of duct tape and staples, 1:25 pilot came back off, they did not announce but I was near the counter and they cleared the plane. Now, have to get the people back on, seats changed because when you go fro. A 3/2 to a 2/2 configuration, some seats no longer exist. Families disrupted, but those that made the flight just glad they could board. NOW. Let’s back up. Hardware change at 2 am. We spoke with a couple that booked last minute, after 9 pm last night. So they knew they were going to do this. NEXT. This airport is small. No food. A “corner” with a drink cooler and a few snacks, out of bottled water. Airport has 4 gates, total combined area of 1 normal airport gate, its small. BREEZE. Disorganized. Clueless. Support (I tried) is AI, it was a Sunday can’t pay people. I will NOT fly with them again. They gave me 5000 miles to my account, don’t care. BREEZE SUCKS.

### "I will never fly with them again"
This is my first time using Breeze and I will never fly with them again. My flight was delayed 5 times. We waited hours thinking our flight would happen. The last delay they ended up canceling flight at 10 pm . So many people either had to call a friend or family member to get them or get a hotel for the night . Some of us stayed at the airport overnight. They kept saying it was maintenance related and then the aircraft had to fly to San Diego from Norfolk. Once it arrived in San Diego we were informed the pilots had to have a break legally from flying since they put in to many hours that day. Breeze attendant could only apologize for the inconvenience. The next morning our flight was pushed back another 30 minutes because the airline had to wait for an Alaska flight to leave the gate so a Breeze airplane could pull up. There is no real counter for Breeze at the airport. The little bit of money you save and the direct flight is not worth this stress. I have read countless same situations from other people. I would never recommend Breeze Airlines. You can’t speak to anyone on phone it’s all through their apps.

### "Absolutely awful customer service"
Absolutely awful customer service. I had a situation involving military change of orders and they refused to even consider my situation. So on a $295 ticket I only retained $65 credit to use on a future flight. I wasn’t even asking for a refund! I only simply needed to change my flight 4 days later for an equal ticket value. They basically just ended their chat with me saying “we’ve helped you to the best of our ability have a nice day”. What an absolutely shame to have zero military appreciation. I’ll never fly with them again. Greedy.

### "Absolutely awful experience"
Absolutely awful experience. Hour wait with 1 working computer to check in bags. 4 people standing around watching. Continual delays, to flight, no communication. Application is awful, can’t even use it to check in. Paid for wifi. No wifi. 4 dollars for a soda? Please. I’m all for saving money, but there’s zero plus to fly Breeze. Rather fly American with a layover than deal with such subpar customer service. Save your money and time, look elsewhere. Never again.

### "not worth the cheap price"
Not Verified |   This airline does not give gate passes to anyone over the age of 12 to assist mothers with very young children who are traveling alone. This not a typo. My daughter  has a 3 and 5 yo who are very active and she is handicapped. We were unable to get clarification why an assisting person has to be 12 or under. Avoid Breeze Airlines. It not worth the cheap price!

### “left with a bad first impression”
Not going to fly with Breeze again. Flight from Orlando, FL. to Burlington, VT, on 6/19-24 was delayed due to mechanical issues, and rescheduled 6/20/24. My return flight from Burlington, VT., to Orlando, FL. On 6/29/24, also Delayed from 7:15 pm. Until, 10:27 pm. Having me scheduled to arrive at nearly 2am on 6/30. No reason given for delay on return flight, making me unsure whether the flight would be cancelled or not. This was my first time flying Breeze Airways, and I can say I was left with a bad first impression. I doubt I’ll fly with Breeze again.

### "told I won't be compensated"
Not Verified |   Missed my first flight due to my flight to Tampa being delayed, which forced me to buy another ticket. After buying that next ticket for a flight home, I was stuck waiting for just about 10 hours due to constant delays. After reaching out about some kind of compensation, I was first told I would receive an email about that after the flight took off. Reached out again after not receiving any information after 8 hours, just to be told I won't be compensated since the delays were caused by air traffic control. Breeze will inconvenience you & then say any reason to not help you feel better even the slightest. Even after expressing my feelings, the representative & supervisor were both dismissive just to end the interaction. Never flying again!

### "40 minutes to get off the airplane"
Never ever fly this airline! It has been the worst experience ever. The plane had to have multiple battery repairs, delayed travel by 2 hours. Then it could only fly for 3 hours so it had to stop on the way to refuel. Then it broke down. We had to change planes in New Orleans. We had to wait 2 hours for a new flight then we finally get to Tampa and we can not park at the gate because they was a failure to notify the airport we were coming. It took another 40 minutes to get off the airplane. Worst experience ever.

### "attendants need sensitivity training"
Breeze flight attendants need sensitivity training for passengers with any sort of flight anxieties. I was publicly humiliated by attendants who ignored my pleas for consideration of my claustrophobia. Rather then show empathy or concern they confined me to rigid rules that no other airline has insisted upon. I've attempted to reach Breeze support to share my concerns but had no luck so sharing here. I have been doing trauma therapy due to irrational fears of being trapped which makes flying a high stress experience for me. I have a checklist of techniques to keep myself calm & take prescribed medication just for the flight. The hardest parts of flying are boarding & exiting the plane when everyone is standing in line as well as when the food cart stops next to my seat & traps me in. These are terrifying experiences for me so I explain this to flight attendants at the beginning of every flight & offer a simple work around that all previous attendants have agreed to, until my recent Breeze flight. Though the Breeze attendants seemed to agree, they did not follow through & rather did things to escalate my anxiety & fear. 2 of the 3 attendants completely ignored my concerns & trapped me with the cart. Because the carts were small enough, when I started to go in a panic, I impulsively tried to escape & squeezed out quickly. I immediately had to start using meditative techniques to try to calm myself in the aisle. One female attendant refused to walk around me & loudly demanded I sit even though the cart was still blocking my seat. When I tried to explain I was panicking cause of claustrophobia, her response was snarky, "Well you do realize you are in a airplane", like I was an idiot. Realizing she was not there to help me & would only exacerbate my anxiety, I walked away from her to focus on calming myself. I sat once the cart was gone, & continued to quietly calm myself. I would think they would want to avoid a repeat of that scenario & be a bit more careful the second time they brought the cart through, but again they blocked my seat with the cart & the other female attendant kept pushing the cart to block me from getting to a safe place. Whatever direction i pivoted, she would move the cart & told me i had to stay which escalated my fear into a full blown trapped panic experience. I was sandwiched between the 2 mini carts & in a total panic I pushed the other cart the male attendant was pushing and escaped away from the female attendant & her cart. While I was trying to quietly calm myself in the aisle and the cart blocking female attendant charged back to me in a rage & spoke loudly in front of all the passengers, first claiming I pushed her. This not true. At most, I could have pushed her cart when making my panicked escape. She continued to make a scene & argue when i tried to remind her of my fears & feeling trapped. She then escalated her accusations & said that I assaulted her. She kept repeated saying i assaulted her, loudly drawing more attention from the passengers & then she got on the plane phone & repeated her lie. I sat straight up & in fear of them coming back, the rest of the flight, constantly looking over my shoulder.

### "be there 2 hours early"
Not Verified |   We purchased a ticket for our son to fly home. He arrived at the airport 1 hour early, went to the counter to get his boarding pass, and the "supervisor" denied him a pass telling him he had to be there 2 hours early.

### “Horrible service, horrible airline”
Not Verified | Horrible, didn’t allow us to check our baggage until two hours prior to the flight, so if security took any longer we would have been late to our flight. When we actually ended up showing up to check our baggage, there were no workers working the bag check and a line that wrapped around other airlines, way farther out than the marked area, and absolutely zero workers there. Horrible service, horrible airline, wish I could give it a 0 or a negative out of ten.

### “customer service is terrible”
I have never experienced so many delays and cancelations from an airline. I lost a days work, time and revenue. Their POOR scheduling and planning negatively affected all of their guests on this flight as we were delayed 3 times on Saturday June 22nd, then canceled. We were then given a new 7:10am flight on Sunday, June 23rd which was delayed until 10:40am. It is now 10:53am and there isn't even a plane at the gate. Their customer service is terrible, as the attendants won't even answer questions. The airline added points to my app, POINTS, as if I want to fly with them ever again!!! I am demanding they make things right for everyone on this flight. We should not be going through this just because they couldn't properly staff and schedule their pilots accordingly, this is THEIR fault and they should do what's right!

### "one of the best experiences"
Not Verified |   This is one of the best experiences I've had on an airline. Check in was easy in Sarasota, no wait at all. Boarding was also smooth. The flight was quick. The flight attendants were great. One in particular had a good sense of humor. On the way back we had quite a line for check in to wait in but it moved very quickly. Boarding again was easy. The flight was very quick without any turbulence. We were very happy.

### "great experience"
Not Verified |   It was great experience. Seats were comfy. We landed 10 minutes early going and returning. It was so easy. Crew was very friendly and helpful. Will definitely use this airline again. Very affordable.

### "late flights are always delayed"
I have flown with Breeze maybe 4 times and it seems the late flights are always delayed. It is bad enough to arrive somewhere at 11:00 pm but when it is delayed and you don't arrive until 12:00 or later it is even worse. Breeze should change there time since they can't ever seem to be on time. This is the third time I have had a delay, out of 4 times flying.

### "I had a great experience"
Not Verified |   Everyone that worked at Breeze was wonderful I had a great experience it was my first time flying with my one year old, and they made it smooth for me on the aircraft. My flight attendant Marc was amazing he helped make it easier experience for me an checked on us often.

### “Breeze please get it together”
Breeze used to be a good reliable affordable airline. How the saying goes, you get what you pay for. This airline has gone down and I’m wondering why. Traveling for work I fly frequently and the last 5 Breeze flights have either had mechanical issues or at the last minute right before pulling out of the gate they claimed the aircraft was in need of “gas”. So the entire time the aircraft was sitting out before us passengers boarded no one thought to fill up the tank on a flight with a final destination from CT to Vegas. What a joke. Every delay is always an hour or more. Breeze please get it together.

### "Charged me $75 for .5 lb over"
Not Verified |   Don’t let the cheap flights fool you. Charged me $75 for .5 lb over! Drunk guys obnoxious on the flights, no wifi yet they advertise this. Baggage check was over an hour late. Literally no customer service. No number to call. They simply don’t care!

### “Last time I fly Breeze”
As we approached lift off the pilot slammed on the breaks. Just about to lift. The pilot said a message came up. We returned to the gate. Had to wait about 1-1/2 hr. Finally went back out to the runway and they said there was a problem with the breaks. Headed back to the gate. The pilot came on and said we were able to get off the plane. If we did get off the plane we would not be able to get back on. We would be taken off the manifest. As we were contemplating what to do we realized the bathrooms had no water. Couldn’t flush or wash hands. Finally they let us get off the plane. Was told another plane was coming to get us. Another plane did show up. We were 6 hrs late getting back to White plains. The gave me $50 in points. I bought 4 tickets for my family and they said in order for the other family members to get the $50 in points they had to make a breeze account. My two kids are under the age of 9 and I don’t want their info online. I was told they had to have an account. Last time I fly Breeze.

### "Absolutely unreliable airline"
Absolutely unreliable airline. Flew twice on the airline and always late by 3-6 hours. The do not even have the coursey to inform in advance and it's always delayed by the gate. On every delay it was the same excuse of 'technical issues' which is just a load of rubbish, for the amount of money they are charging they should have a top condition flying fleet.

### "on our Do Not Book list"
Booked twice with Breeze. Both times the flight was cancelled hours after it was supposed to depart. The first time, we were not even notified that the flight was delayed until we had already arrived at the airport. Turns out the plane was still on the ground in Orlando, 3 hours away. Breeze could have - and should have - let us know hours before. Clearly Breeze knew the flight would be delayed many hours because the plane was still on the ground in Florida. We waited almost 8 hours at Plattsburgh with no information at all except "the plane is coming. The plane finally arrived more than 8 hours late, we boarded, taxied out, then taxied back in again, purportedly due to a failure in the overhead speaker system. Then the flight was cancelled. The flight was rescheduled for the next morning - at 7am! - then rescheduled 8 more times. It eventually went to the next day, again, 2 hours late. Total nightmare. We gave Breeze a second chance. Bad decision. Basically a repeat of the first time, but at least Breeze canceled the flight when it was 2 hours late and the plane (again) still hadn't left Orlando, rather than making us wait at the airport for 8 hours. This time we wasted only 3 hours. But the flight was not even rescheduled, it was just cancelled. Had to drive to Albany to fly JetBlue. These guys at Breeze are not beginners. They started JetBlue, back when JetBlue was a quality airline. But Breeze is a complete disaster. It joins the ranks of Spirit and Frontier. Cheap flights that are many hours late and/or canceled 99% of the time. Such a shame. The planes are nice and the routing is nice. But until Breeze gets it act together, it joins the ranks of Spirt and Frontier on our Do Not Book list.

### "$52 to be completely up front"
Not Verified |   I have flown Breeze three times all together. My very first flight last year was wonderful. It was listed as a $29 flight and it was. This last flight that I took on May 20th, was from Tampa to Gulfport. When I booked I was discouraged because of the prices had went up so much. I really should say not the price of the flight, but if you've ever flown Breeze before you will know that when you go to book there is a section that says do you want nice seat, nicer seat, or the nicest seat. It used to be when Breeze's first started for a long time the nice seat was completely free. Not any longer so that increases your ticket price a minimum of $35. I guess my issue this time was I paid an extra $52 to be completely up front with the leg room the free drinks and snacks. Unbeknownst to me there was no snacks except one waffle. I contacted them and they said well normally we have popcorn potato chips m&Ms cheese and crackers I was told by the stewardess that no one stalked the plane. So yes I was discouraged I had paid extra I couldn't even get a drink or a snack.and it makes it really bad for the airline itself because they could have sold snacks to the people in the back but they didn't have any.

### “loved everything about my experience”
Not Verified | I have flown with Breeze twice both flying out of PVD Airport RI. I am seeing so many negatives on this airline which I’m surprised. I loved everything about my experience but mostly how nice the flight staff were. On 4 flights everyone was friendly and accommodating. This may seem minor but I avoid flying United, Spirit and US air at all cost because of past experiences for me and other passengers. Not to mention delays, cancellations and loss luggage. Also people mentioned in reviews you have to pay for drinks and snacks so do many other airlines. The days of freebies are gone. Seats were very comfortable I didn’t feel cramped at all. Most planes I have flown in the past my knees were almost touching the seat in front of me. Very uncomfortable if you’re in the middle seat. But I loved flying Breeze and until I don’t Breeze is definitely my go to airline.

### "left me stranded in Alabama"
If you don't want to waste your money and time, don't travel with this company, they have terrible customer service, they only assist you by text and none of their employees know what to do. They left me stranded in Alabama until the other day because they oversold the flight and then they made a change of plane to a smaller one and they were left with about 6 people. The only thing they tell you is that they can't do anything. You text customer service and they can't do anything either. It cost me almost 600 dollars to be stranded in Alabama. We rented a hotel. car AND the company. It says it will return them in 30 days. To make matters worse, I received a msg today that I have to fill out the claim again because it doesn't appear, but how can it be? They need to give better training to their employees who don't even know the links they have to send you to make claims. Si no quieres perder tu dinero y tiempo no viajes con esta compañía tienen un terrible servicio al cliente solo te atienden por texto y ninguno de sus empleados sabe que hacer me dejaron varada en Alabama hasta el otro día por que sobre vendieron el vuelo y después hicieron un cambio de avión a uno más pequeño y se quedaron sobre 6 personas Lo único que te dicen es que ellos no pueden hacer nada que textees con servicio al cliente y ellos tampoco pueden hacer nada Me salió casi 600 dólares el quedarme varada en Alabama alquilamos hotel carro Y la compañía. Dice que los devuelve en 30 días Para colmo recibo un msg hoy que tengo que volver a llenar el reclamo por que no les aparece pero como es pocible Nesecitan darle un mejor training a sus empleados que no saben ni los links que te tienen que enviar para hacer los reclamos

### "attendants are friendly and attentive"
As i booked in January, i was so happy to snag a deal with Breeze Airways. But never had I expected that come April 27, 2024, we will be delayed for 10 hours at Jacksonville International Airport. We took the effort to come on time for the check-in process at 6 AM. But they made us wait a lot at the airport and there was no proper customer agent that is present in the boarding area to attend to those stranded passengers. Yes, they made us wait for 10 hours. As for the flight, it was great and uneventful. Flight attendants are friendly and attentive to the needs. The 5 hour flight to Las Vegas was not made boring due the availability of WIFI. The only downside is the 10-hour delayed flight.

### “Breeze was very communicative”
Recent flight from Madison Wis to Orlando Fl May 15th. The Day started off not great, got notification of my delayed flight at 8:31a.m. for a 9:40 departure (I was already at the airport) Problem was that the airplane I was supposed to be on hadn't actually left Orlando yet. With only two Breeze flights a week out of Madison my options looked bad. The gate agent did not have a lot of information about when we would be able to go other than the plane had not left Orlando due to weather. Considering the unknowns of weather Breeze was very communicative, gate agents let us know when the plane left and as it arrived got everybody in the terminal ready to board quickly and be on our way. They boarded us quickly unfortunately we were delayed again before everybody could get on and seated. The pilot was outstanding, he was the one on the plane that explained why we need to get back off and in the terminal he spent a good 20 minutes talking to people and letting us know that he was going to do everything he could to get us out as soon as possible. Our new expected departure of 6:00 p.m. kept moving earlier and Breeze Air constantly sent email updates to keep us informed. They also provided $20 emailed vouchers for food and beverages. The flight got a clear to go and the captain, gate agents and flight crew hustled everybody on board to make sure we didn't miss our slot. The gate agent even delivered food from the terminal that a passenger decided not to wait for. What could have been a bad experience was saved by an awesome pilot and attentive and helpful crew. Flight itself was comfortable (had Ascent class) with roomy seats and lots of leg room and charging ports. Complimentary drinks, snacks and wifi. Snack choices were limited but ok for a short flight.

### "unhelpful and don’t care"
Not Verified |   Terrible airline! On my way to Florida the flight got delayed from 3 to 7 and then to come home it was delayed again 7 to 12, and now it’s 1am, and I’m sitting on the aircraft and we haven’t left yet. They have done nothing to compensate for my lost time and money this is a terrible airline and I never want to be on it again. They are unhelpful and don’t care about other people’s schedules. I booked the times I needed for flights specifically and then had to scramble to figure out my schedule when both flights were delayed.

### “Each time there were problems”
Not Verified |  In the past 6 months we have flown Breeze three times: November 2023; December 2023; May 2024. Each time there were problems. NOV 2023, a Thanksgiving trip. The scheduled flight was canceled on the day of departure, so the holiday with the family was missed. Rescheduled 3 days later. Very unhappy. DEC 2023, CHRISTMAS EVE! Flight was canceled; the choice was, fly several days later or fly to a different city. Ended up in Hartford, not Providence. Had to arrange for a ride to Providence at Midnight on Christamas Eve. Very unhappy. MAY 2024, flight canceled 9 hours before departure. Missing important bank meeting AND funeral of a close friend. Rescheduled for following day. Very unhappy. Ground staff and cabin staff were OK - embarrassed, but did what they could. Reliability of scheduling? Minus numbers. Don't plan on accuracy in date & time [or city!!]

### "flight did not have Wi-Fi"
Was told I could have 5 checked bags free on the Breeze website and by a live agent online since I am traveling on military orders. Got to the counter to check my bags in and they said I could only check 2. A Relative traveling with me also was promised 2 checked bags since they purchased Breeze Ascent seats and was told he could only have one. There was no explanation provided for this. Also the flight did not have Wi-Fi, which was another thing we were told they would have. Aside from that everything else was good.

### "seats are comfy"
Breeze Airways is such a stress free company to purchase tickets from. My first ticket, I got $150 airline credit back from them! The seats are comfy (more…)

### “I was very impressed”
Not Verified | This was my first experience with Breeze Airways. I had to book a flight at the last minute and they actually had the best fare. I returned on another carrier (a major carrier) because their return flight was not on the day I needed to return. I must say I was very impressed. The crew was professional, the plane was nice and clean. The boarding process was timely and we left and arrived on time. While I had heard of others who have flown Breeze having a poor experience - that was not my situation. I would absolutely travel them again.

### "I never got to fly this airline"
I never got to fly this airline as the flight was delayed multiple times for "maintenance". I picked Breeze because they offer direct flights from Las Vegas to Fort Myers, FL. I ordered the tickets a few weeks ahead for $228. There were numerous bad reviews about Breeze Airways that I read before signing up but most were from around Christmas time or Thanksgiving when it is cold and there are lots of delays with all airlines so I figured going in late April I wouldn't be as likely to have issues. Many people complained about likely weather related delays and luggage issues. As a result, I did not upgrades, no carry-ons or luggage, no seat upgrades, nothing and am figuring no WIFI, nothing how could I be disappointed. My flight was supposed to leave 12:30PM and by 5:30AM when I woke up I received an email from 4:30AM showing there is a delay for maintenance reasons pushing flight to 1:10PM, then by 5:50AM received another email 2:40PM, 7AM email said 9PM (now it is an overnight flight). Then by 8:48AM it changed to 8AM the next morning. Is this how airlines do their delays? It seems totally unprofessional doing it like this. If it is really a maintenance related reason for the delay I would think by now with newer planes they should be able to do it quickly. Also the airline is said to be started by the guy that did JetBlue so I would think they know how to do that. It turns out JetBlue has horrible ratings too so maybe the founder is just really bad at this. Even if they are short staffed then why does this airline keep expanding? Obviously at this point I had complete lack of confidence with Breeze being able to fly me under reasonable conditions. At this point I basically see Breeze like one of those farm trucks in Mexico with day laborers in it and I'm holding up my finger hitchhiking waiting for a ride. That is basically my level of confidence with Breeze. With so many delays in such a short period of time, I figured there is no way I can trust Breeze because they could mess that flight up, more delays plus I have a return flight with them which they could screw that up then I'm stuck in Fort Myers in a smaller airport with few cheap flights out of there. I went to "My Trips" in Breeze to get the refund but it appears that it doesn't want to do the 100% refund there so I contacted Breeze support of SMS and texted back and forth told them I wanted a full refund and they did the full refund and said will take 7-10 days. I then re-booked about 10 days from now to Spirit Airlines which has a better reliability rating and more routes. I really wanted to try Breeze as they seem to have nicer and newer planes and wanted to avoid the traffic from the Orlando airport but I think that was a mistake especially if your destination is far from the airport (80 miles) could drive for hours to Fort Myers and be stuck there. Breeze has very few flights going out of Fort Meyers to Las Vegas so they are infrequent and if they are down for maintenance could be there for days or have to find a pricier airline. So, I think Orlando is a better option because there are way more flights there if you get an unreliable carrier like Breeze or they screw up a flight have options available.

### "refuses to honor the promo
I am so discouraged with Breeze. This was my favorite airline, I recommended it highly. Then they started charging for carry-ons. That’s not even the worst. They offer a promotion then they won’t permit you to complete the transaction As shown they say contact a customer service, this was at 8am. I called the number given, the gentlemen was rude & quickly said I can’t help you. Then hung up. I tried the text chat The person tried to be helpful. Suggested I rebook, said promo no longer works. They said promo ended because it met its max, this was after 4PM, 8 hrs later. But I used this at 6am in the morning. Breeze refuses to honor the promo even though it was their fault with IT

### "this is the  worst experience"
This is my first time flying and this is the  worst experience / decision I’ve ever had. M flight was supposed to depart at 2:00pm I still haven’t left the airport and it’s 5:10pm because the flight had been getting delayed all day after we were told we were switching planes. I will never in my life fly with Breeze airways again.

### "they would need to bounce me off"
I booked weeks in advance to come home and always fly their so called Breeze Ascent seats. I had seat 3D. Today they called my name and said they were over booked and I said, what does that have to do with me. She said that they would need to bounce me off because they were over booked and another person paid a lot of money for my seat. I said your not serious. I said I have surgery scheduled for 11am tomorrow and I proved it. She managed to find me a seat in row 22. Well why not for the other guy. I learn from people there that they pull this all the time. I sit up front for many reasons and one is I had cancer and my stomach was completely removed. When I need to use the bathroom I just can't go fast enough. I see on line that they showed me in row 22C and it also says Breeze Ascent Seat. You don't get the nicest in row 22C. I'm told and it's on my phone no less that this person paid a lot more than me. The more I fly with them the more I get screwed. There were several older people who heard what was happening and just couldn't believe what the woman had said. In fact she couldn't believe it herself. The man next to me said they were offering $750. earlier to whom ever would give up their seat. I'm not sure how accurate that is, but I got really screwed. Imagine, the seat went to the highest bidder. I spend hundreds to sit up front and they just said they would credit me $73.00.

### "airline is a major clown show"
Not Verified |   Checked in and waiting for an already late departure to hear my name along with wife and two young daughters over the loud speaker. The agent tells me we are not getting on the plane because Breeze overbooked. We were offered $1550 per person and told the next flight out was in two days. Go find a hotel since this is my fault for expecting my reserved seats to be available after checking in 1 hr and 45 minutes early. This smuck tried to make it appear the overbooking was not his responsibility and made not only me but another 12-15 customers feel responsible for this mistake through the utmost arrogance. There was very little explanation and no discussions for a very long time. The airline even called the police to intervene; however, the officers quickly sided with the customers. Regardless, my kids finished their vacation crying. This airline is a major clown show with no compassion for their customers following their corporate mistakes. There was much more but I think the point has been made. Thanks for the email this morning offering $20 in breeze points. lol

### "indifferent response from the airline staff"
Today, I found myself engulfed in a whirlwind of frustration and helplessness at the Breeze Airlines check-in counter. With my infant son in tow, a stroller, and bags containing crucial medications already on the airline, I faced the daunting reality of missing my flight by a mere 2 minutes. I take full responsibility for not arriving at the gate on time, a consequence of nursing my son and navigating air travel with him for the first time. To compound matters, the flight, scheduled for departure at 1:55, was delayed until after 3 PM due to unforeseen plane maintenance. Despite the aircraft remaining on the tarmac, the staff adamantly refused my boarding, adhering strictly to airline guidelines. While I respect and understand such protocols, the situation was further exacerbated by the indifferent response from the airline staff. As I stood there, grappling with the weight of the situation, the staff's lack of empathy pierced through the chaos. Instead of offering practical solutions or even a modicum of support, they merely directed me to contact "Breeze chat" for assistance. No mention of alternative options, no guidance on whom to reach out to for help – just a vague suggestion to navigate the already stressful situation alone. Furthermore, what struck me most profoundly was the absence of tangible support. A simple card with essential contact information or a brief guide on navigating the aftermath of a missed flight could have provided a lifeline amidst the uncertainty. Instead, I was left to fend for myself, grappling with the daunting task of determining how and when I would reach my destination and retrieve my essential belongings. In moments like these, the significance of compassionate customer service cannot be overstated. A touch of empathy, a willingness to extend assistance beyond the bare minimum, could have transformed this harrowing experience into a manageable setback. However, what I encountered served as a stark reminder of the chasm between bureaucratic protocol and genuine human concern. As I reflect on this ordeal, I hold onto the hope for a future where airlines prioritize not only efficiency but also the well-being of their passengers. For now, I navigate the aftermath of my missed flight with a sense of disillusionment, yet with a newfound appreciation for the profound impact of empathy in customer service. I earnestly hope for a response from Breeze Airlines, not only for resolution but also to foster understanding and empathy towards passengers who find themselves in similar predicaments.

### “it is just not worth it”
I have flown Breeze twice, there were delays both times, the most recent, I was stuck in the airport for 7 hours and plane was delayed several times, finally in the evening, they told us it was cancelled after spending all day there waiting. We had to find a hotel and make all kinds of other arrangements due to the cancellation. The next day, we still left late. I cannot take this airline again, it is just not worth it to me to get a non-stop flight when delays continue to happen. people depend on their flights and times coming and going for so many reasons. It is way too inconvenient for this to happen to me again, I am done with Breeze. Apologies do not take away all the issues we had to deal with because of the delays and spending an extra night. I would rather have a layover and be able to feel confident my fight is happening when it is supposed too. We had to pay for the hotel up front and then get reimbursed, what if people can't pay up front because they weren't planning for another night? There were 2 minors on the flight who had to stay in the airport because minors can't book a room. It just is not worth the aggravation and all the folks I spoke too are done with Breeze. Then they charge for drinks on the plane/food/ snacks, really, I wouldn't still be there if your plane left when it was supposed too! They should be doing everything they can to make it up to you, DONE!

### “Rude misinformed staff”
Not Verified |  I wish I had read the previous reviews before deciding on Breeze Airways. Rude misinformed staff, and they take advantage of seniors experiencing a family crisis. Never book a flight with this company.

### “Bad experience all around”
Not Verified |  So I was really excited to try Breeze Airways but won't be doing so again! I was held up at the rental car kiosk because someone returned a car without a key fob (strange). When I finally got to the terminal there was not a person to be found at the Breeze Airways desk! They close 45 minutes before the flight! I had no way to check my luggage and the neighboring airlines would not help me locate a Breeze employee. I took my luggage to the security checkpoint where I was told that I have to ditch the luggage. Security was finally able to contact someone from the airlines that took my luggage before I had to toss my belongings! Finally got on the plane, my reserved seat was taken and the Stewardess put me in a different seat instead of telling that person they were in the wrong seat! Bad experience all around and I definitely will NOT fly Breeze again!

### "Delay for 6 hrs for no reason"
Not Verified |   First and last time flying with this company. Delay for a total of 6 hrs for no reason, there was no issue with the weather or anything. They had enough time to get another plane. The service was bad, either they are new or they just don’t care for you. I would choose Spirit anytime over this.

### "seemed like they couldn't care less"
This is the second trip I've taken with Breeze and both times there were issues with the plane causing major delays. At least last time the immediately offered a Breeze points discount but this time nothing, not even upon request. Then on top of this I purchased bag check-ins online but when my wife and sons arrived they were told they had to pay again. Breeze refused to refund me and so I had to contact my bank to dispute the charges. Breeze seemed like they couldn't care less about losing a customer. I would highly recommend steering clear of this airline!

### “two very poor experiences”
I really, really want to like this airline- but it has given me two very poor experiences, my time is too valuable to allow a third. The flight was initially delayed for maintenance - it was boarded and delayed with passengers on the plane for more maintenance - then the taxi occurred - stopped again in need of more maintenance. I question all together the safety of this aircraft. My other experience occurred on a Norfolk to Providence flight where the plane was continuously delayed at a variety of intervals over a four hour period and then cancelled. Our flight attendants pre flight talk was given with intonations indicating she was bored to death and could have cared less. On top of all of this you pay for everything having to do with the flight experience separately, making this a high cost ticket with no reward. This airline in my experience has been undependable, uncomfortable and now I question the safety of the planes themselves. Research this company before you decide to fly with them. And if my experiences hold with others if you arrive at your destination at all, it will not be on time.

### "I wouldn’t fly breeze again"
Not Verified |   I paid for an emergency row seat and they moved my seat number 2 days before my flight to a regular seat. So, $35 wasted! There is absolutely NO one to talk to about this issue! Breeze airways is a joke when it comes to customer service. The flight attendants are also very casual and really seem to careless about safety and their passengers. The aircraft is comfortable and appears well maintained. If you can score a cheap flight then it’s probably worth it. But, beware you are on your own! No help at all! I wouldn’t fly breeze again unless I score a ticket $100 less than other airlines. It is definitely worth paying more to have a courteous and helpful airline.

### "reps seemed totally unconcerned"
They displaced my luggage and it was not returned to me for 13 days. It was discovered after 9 days in Cleveland, OH and took another 4 days for them to deliver it to me. My flight didn't even go through Cleveland? Their customers reps seemed totally unconcerned and made no special effort to try and find it, telling me that they try to be fair and consistent to all of their customers that lose bags and used the excuse that they are not a 24/7 operation and it takes them up to 15 days to locate bags, despite their written policy that says that you can file a claim for reimbursement after 10 days. When I questioned this they said that they do a final search at 10 days. The truth is they weren't making any significant effort to try and locate it. Why do they look for it after 10 days, instead of immediately? They don't have a baggage tracking system at their New Orleans location so they have no idea where your bag is and are unable to track it. There is no one you can talk to and they never called me, instead you have to correspond with them via impersonal emails.

### “No compensation offered”
5 hour delay out of Springfield, Illinois and now find out that my return flight is delayed as well. First and last time I fly Breeze Airways. No compensation offered!! Do not fly this airline!

### "Excellent experience"
Flight was 6am and the reverse flight was 8:30pm, both left on time and arrived on time. Somehow the flight from Jax to BDL was only 2 hours 10 min. Seating is a little cramped but ok, I got free coffee, you can recharge your phone at your seat. It turned out to be the cheapest and fasted flight from BDL to JAX. Excellent experience

### "The experience was awful"
The experience was awful. Booking the ticket was difficult and there is no customer service to speak with. The flight was delayed three times which turned out to be over three hours. The last text read, we are sorry and we will make this up to you. When arriving at the gate, we asked if we could upgrade to a seat with more leg room, we were told, I can’t help you, you have to do it in the app. I couldn’t find where it showed the available seats, I asked for assistance and was told, I can’t help you, I don’t know how to finds things on the app. Honestly, a stranger passenger overheard the conversation and offered to help. They helped me find the now available seat because so many passengers dropped off. I PAID to upgrade the seats. So much for making it up to you

### "Not a good way to run things"
We paid extra for seating and free Wi-Fi only to find out the plane didn’t have Wi-Fi. Nothing was acknowledged to us about any type of credit or anything. Not a good way to run things.

### "an awesome experience"
Not Verified |  My first time using this airline with my son. It was an awesome experience, not stressed, nobody checking everything that you bring that make you feel uncomfortable that they will charge more money. The crew was so friendly, they offered to my 5 years old boy to met the Captain, he was so happy.

### "I really enjoy the service"
I have to travel from Richmond to San Francisco every month because of my work. This direct flight makes my life much easier. The departure and arrival times are great on both destinations. Nice and friendly flight attendants, neat and clean inside the plane. Wi-Fi only $8.00. After applying some points, it only costs 5 to 6 dollars to enjoy my entertainment and makes the flight fast. Most of time the flight is on time . Only one time when the flight was delayed, we were awarded the points worth $100. I really enjoy the service of the Breeze Airways.

### "The entire process was perfect"
This is our second time flying with Breeze from Providence to Orlando. The entire process was perfect. The attitude of the staff and captain on both flights was great this flight we checked our luggage no problem I like the fact that you can reserve your seat ahead and Airbus has a 2–3 seat layout so 2 can sit together. People complain about price but when you added the luggage and seat it was cheaper than Southwest. We will fly them again

### "never been treated so unfairly"
I take about 150 flights a year and live in Vero Beach, FL. Breeze started flying to VB about a year ago and it's been great to use when I fly to the Northeast, which is often. However, I just had a terrible experience. They changed the plane type after I booked and their Ascent seats weren't on that plane. I had purchased a Nicest Bundle for $125 more than the Nicer Bundle. Nicer includes a "more leg room" seat, (1) checked bag, and (1) carry on. Nicest includes an Ascent seat, (2) checked bags, and (1) carry on. They put me in a "more leg room" seat and refunded me $20. That doesn't seem right, does it? First of all, I didn't check any bags. I purchased the Nicest Bundle for the seat, not the bags. They said that they give me $20 because the (2) checked bags and (1) carry on are worth $105 and I still got those. Well if that's their thought process, than shouldn't it only be for the $35 for the difference of (1) additional checked bag. I take around 150 flights a year and have never been treated so unfairly. I want people to be aware that Breeze has no problem sticking it to their customers.

### "discriminatory against me"
The crew were discriminatory against me for sitting in the emergency exit row today. They did not identify their problem with me, but I can see that they are indirectly saying, “you are deaf and you cannot sit here.” The crew looked at me firmly and asked me to move to the back of the plane. This is the most humiliating approach they took on against their customer. They stood so proud and relieved for accomplishing their mission regardless of my informing them that I have sat in emergency rows for years.

### "offered nothing in compensation"
I've flown breeze many times, love everything about it but my last trip 2/15, my luggage never made it to my destination. The inconvenience of not having your clothes medication nothing for 3 days because the next flight to Syracuse is Sunday. Thanks breeze for ruining my trip oh and they offered nothing in compensation except my baggage fee.

### "not providing WiFi at all"
Not Verified |  First time on this airline and we were met at the check-counter with a comment: You have to wait until 2 hours prior to the Departure time before checking in. Even though we had pre checked in online we just wanted to check our baggage.! Upon being told we could not check baggage yet, please take a seat and wait till you’re called.Only 3 people doing the check-ins. Once at the gate, boarding was a free-for-all as we watched people cutting in front of each other to board first while the elderly and disabled were attempting to board. She lost control and did not try to regain control in the situation probably out of fear from those doing the cutting in line. Once aboard we were pleasantly greeted and then told  “We have no WiFi on this flight”. Once the crew were making their way around with the snacks - we found out Can of soda was $2.00 each, chips or crackers were $4.50 each, nothing complimentary on Breeze. Should I had chosen to upgrade my seats for the $100.00 fee, I would have gotten the $0.99 bag of chips for free & the soda that runs $2.59 / 6 pack for free instead of the Inflated prices of $2 per can and the $4.50 per bag of chips. Half way through the flight, the cabin began to suffer the ill effects of the bathroom odors, not very pleasant as we were seated 10+ rows behind the bathroom area. Return Flight, Scheduled for departure on 12/26/23 @ 3:04pm,delayed 2 hours,we ended up being at the airport 4 hours prior to the departure time. Flight moved to the following day. Upon speaking with the ticket counter, we were told to just go on the app and complain but nothing will happen Once we boarded, we immediately attempted to log into the wifi but after a few attempts, an announcement was made that there will be no wifi on this flight. Flight supposed to depart at 8am… We waited 10 mins for two females that arrived late blaming the airline for not allowing them to arrive early or on time. We did eventually depart at 8:27am. Wifi was part of the price and the rip people off by not providing WiFi at all.

### "Just lost me as a passenger"
Not Verified |  Worst day. First they delayed the flight for 3 hours then the girl taking the tickets gave the wrong gate to relocate to. Then after waiting for an hour to get in plane the ticket agent slammed the door almost hitting the women behind me. So then we wait. Took awhile to get to our seats. Then we get to Rsw only to have another lane in the bay. We have to go someplace to wait and here we are landed 45 min ago and still on plane waiting to get off. Pilot say it happen but it should not. They arrival time was known. They just don’t care. I was suppose to be here at noon and it’s 3.35 still on plane and don’t know how much longer. Will be over 4 hours delayed. Just lost me as a passenger. Weather I get, incompetence I don't.

### "the most incompetent bunch"
Absolutely the most incompetent bunch of untrained, unmotivated, unprofessional, unaccountable employees of any company I have ever seen. If they offered me unlimited free flights to anywhere for the rest of my life, I wouldn't get close enough to one of their planes to spit on it.

### “flight attendants were combative and rude”
Not Verified | Let me first say that I have flown Breeze numerous times and have never had a problem. The flight attendants on this flight, specifically, Brittany, were combative and rude with passengers. Not, with me, just speaking what I witnessed. A passenger was trying to get her attention and couldn't so he tapped her on her back and she very quickly told him "do not touch me" and acted like he was not worthy to do so. I work with the public in my everyday job as well, so I understand wanting boundaries but she was a little over the top. When EVERYONE around her pointed put that she seemed rude she started arguing with them. The passengers were actually the ones to deescalate the situation trlling her to just forget it. Mind you, she is a heavy set woman and she touch me about 4 different times while walking through the isle. This flight was about half full, people were wanted to travel in a little more comfortably. People were asking to move (within their zone) just to get more space and they were being so rude about it. I can hear her in the back of the plane complaining about the passengers to another crew member. It is all very unprofessional. I completely understand that there is a system that needs to be followed but the behavior was just not warranted.

### "pleased to have a good flight"
Not Verified | Absolutely wonderful experience as always. I fly Breeze maybe half a dozen times a year. The fares and low, I add on what I need (bags, seat, sometimes my dog, etc) and go. The airport experience is simple, the crews are some of the nicest I’ve ever encountered. Captain Tanner took the time to welcome us on board from the cabin (actually the second time he’s flown one of our flights) and the flight attendants are attentive. Yes, occasionally there’s a 20 minute delay here or there but frankly I’m just pleased to have a good flight.

### "like a Greyhound bus line"
Not Verified | This is my first and last flight with Breeze. It’s like a Greyhound bus line. Flight delayed 7 hours and then instead of flying from Kentucky to San Francisco, we flew to Utah waited there 1 more house and then to San francisco.

### "Complete lack of accountability"
Not Verified | Arrived at Bradley 5am. Ticketing not open yet, though plane supposed to board at 6:30 for 7:10 departure. They open more lines eventually. Plane delayed to 7:37 by a late Breeze employee (who got called out by name over the intercom by the pilot, literally the only somewhat entertaining moment about this experience). Arrive 9:11 (late) in Pittsburgh for "Breeze thru". Except that an utter imbecile ran a baggage cart under the nose of the plane, and got it stuck. Chaos ensues, including the captain asking the first class passengers to move to the back of the plane to reduce weight at the front, a la Italian Job. Plane discovered to have been damaged. It's noon by the time they decide they need a new plane. Everyone disembarks with carryons. New plane arrives around 4 but oops! This plane somehow isn't taking on potable water (oh, and had a lighting issue, according to the pilot's comments before takeoff) Need a mechanic that's apparently not available. Online flight info never corrected - at 5:20 it said the plane was leaving at 4:18. Proactive messaging had stopped after a 12 noon "we're getting you a new plane" message. No food vouchers. No updated information. Surly and rude agent who said, "this IS a Discount airline" so apparently this is the treatment Breeze has "trained" its employees to believe is acceptable in exchange for a pseudo-affordable no frills flight. Planes, when you eventually make it onto one that isn't broken, are dirty. Finally boarded 5:45. At 6pm, site still showing a 5:52 departure. At 6:16 it updated to say departure was at 6:13. The entire day, the site posted times have been misleading and quite frankly, utterly dishonest. Plane finally took off, not that the site has the correct departure time - it's still showing 6:13. Complete lack of accountability and professionalism on all levels, resulting in an expected arrival over NINE HOURS LATER than it was supposed to, plus a bonus scripted message offering the most non-apology of apologies I've ever read. Never, ever flying this airline again, and will be sharing this experience on ALL platforms.

### "Seats were a bit uncomfortable"
Not Verified | It was alright. Couple of delays, also really foggy and a lot of turbulence. Seats were a bit uncomfortable, but that's it. I don't really know what else to say so - pumpernickel.

### "cancellations can be crucial"
5th time flying Breeze and each time, there was a SNAFU. This time, flight out of Raleigh was delayed due to weather. I get that, no problem. My concern is their communications and keeping people informed is downright horrible with no one to talk to VIA phone. Everyone on the flight knew it was going to be cancelled but they waited hours before telling anyone. Then the next day, the same flight crew, same plane but they delayed for 90 minutes and why not fly out first thing in the morning. It took until 12:15 before departure. They are great when it works but out of 5 times, one cancel, three major delay including 5 hours before leaving BDL., well over 60 minutes before baggage arrived in BDL and CHS. Only 1 in 5 times did everything go as planned. My advice is to not check luggage if possible, bring an extra pair of clothes and be very flexible. Also, know your surroundings for hotel accommodations because cancellations can be crucial with Breeze.

### "it's definitely worth it"
Not Verified |  If you are going to fly a budget airline (like Frontier, Spirit, etc), my flight was fully credited when cancelling. This was the cheapest flight option and not an upgraded ticket. All planes I've been on are four seats in a row, so no middle seat. For the price, it's definitely worth it.

### "consider opening up the timeline to check bags"
Breeze is cutting passengers very close to boarding on time by not checking people bags in earlier than 2 hours before the flight. This does time crunch also put added stress to passengers because they still need to get through security with all other passengers flying on other airlines. Hopefully, this airlines has a really good refund policy and don’t really like beat reviews. Maybe consider opening up the timeline to check bags longer than 2 hours.

### "Worst experience"
Not Verified |  Worst experience I’ve ever had with a flight, on their own time and took so long to board the plane. Would not keep us informed and was five hours past my original arrival time, never will be flying this airline again!

### “They refused to refund my money”
On November 30, Breeze Airways, on their own accord, cancelled my return flight from Fort Myers to Columbus, OH, which was to occur on Jan 23, 2024. They re-slotted me to a flight on Jan 21, two days earlier than the original flight and thus greatly disrupting my vacation plans. They gave me the option to obtain a refund, which I requested. Instead, they issued Breeze points because I had cancelled the original reservation and rebooked it once a better promotion code came out. When I obtained the refund during this switch-out, I requested Breeze points to obtain instant credit to rebook the flight. I explained to them the points on my account weren’t true rewards and that the series of cancellations and rebooking could ultimately be traced to a credit card payment. They refused to refund my money and ultimately started ignoring my emails and text messages. I mean, they cancelled my reservation ultimately, not me, and they screwed up my vacation plans. They left me scrambling to find another flight, which I did on another airline at a higher price. A dispute with the credit card company for part of the amount is currently in process.

### “We had a great experience”
We had a great experience. There was a minor delay flying to Fort Myers and the return flight actually left early and arrived early. Everything went very smoothly. There was no meal service but huge snacks and free alcohol if you wanted it (if you are seated up front). The seats are really nice in this "Ascent" section (the equivalent of first class) with a decent recline and leg rests that made it extra comfortable.

### “it was very hard to rest”
With three attendants talking in the rear of the plane the WHOLE trip it was very hard to rest (I did fall asleep while they did purchases) only to woken by the voices of their chatter when they finished. Not to mention one of the attendants water bottles fell from her hand on landing and shot down the entire isle to the front of the plane like a bullet and they laughed about it. Ironically they talked about "awareness" from their training and were so unaware of the disturbed passengers in the back of the plane from the constant talking between them.

### “you’ll hate saving money this way”
Upgraded to an ascent seat (their version of first class). Still has to pay $50 for a checked bag and carry on. Also had to board with zone 4. This is my 6th flight with Breeze. Each flight has had its share of problems from on time issues, extremely rude front counter/check in staff, and problems getting checked luggage at the destination even though it’s a direct flight (45 minute wait at the carousel for bags to show up). The pros are cheaper fares. But you’ll hate saving money this way.

### "Breeze has been fantastic"
Breeze has been fantastic. My husband and I fly them direct from LA to Richmond (game changer), and they have been nothing but great. Always on time, great communication and wonderful staff. In fact, on our last flight we were actually early. Will definitely keep flying Breeze!

### "Absolutely a great experience"
Absolutely a great experience. Everybody from the check in desk to the crew were great. I will fly this every time that I can. My son is coming home for Christmas and will be flying Breeze. The only improvement would be hot food and internet.

### "entire experience was very pleasant"
Two back to back great experiences. First, my son’s boarding pass did not display a TSA pre-check and it was less than 24 hours to our flight. The Breeze representatives spent at least half an hour chatting with me, trying to figure it out by creating a new account, etc. and they ultimately discovered that his TSA pre-check was expired. I would never have known without their very patient help. Five stars on customer service. Second, we were flying this morning into an area of the country that had storms. The pilot told us that turbulence was likely during the last leg of our flight. The pilot did an amazing job. Not only was the flight and landing much less turbulent than expected, the entire experience was very pleasant, five stars for staff and pilot competence and skills.

### "This airline is the worst"
This airline is the worst. The only thing good about this airline is their prices but you definitely get what you pay for. Received an email an hour before take-off (just as I was arriving from my hour-long drive) that my flight was canceled due to “Aircraft Maintenance” no delay, no re-route, nothing. My flight was pretty empty so my guess is the airline didn’t have enough bodies in seats to pay for the fuel. Fast forward to the next day, we finally get on the plane and the Captain gets on the intercom to disclose that unfortunately they do not have any snacks or anything but they have warm Gatorade! This airline is a sorry excuse for a company.

### “wish they would add more routes”
Excellent experience with Breeze Ascent. First time flying this airline and one of better flight experiences we have had in a long time, esp. with domestic flights. Hartford to Savannah non-stop was worth extra ground travel time to Hartford for us. Planes were new or newly-refurbished, interiors clean + neat. Comfortable seats, pleasant staff on ground and in-flight. Only complaint - they upgraded 3 men (pilots from legacy carrier) to the seats directly behind us on 1st trip. The passengers did not stop talking, very loudly, the entire flight (one would think AA pilots would have a little more self-awareness and concern for other passengers' experience?) They were served multiple hard alcohol drinks and only got louder and less considerate as flight went on - crew were friendly + indulging to them, but perhaps, should have stopped serving them or suggested they speak a little more softly? That said, highly recommend and wish they would add more routes.

### "he's stranded at the airport"
Airline changed my son's flight to tomorrow now he's stranded at the airport which is 2 hrs away from his school. I got refunded a $100 dollars, thanks Breeze the Uber ride will cost me $175.00. I guess that you get what you pay for, tries to save some money flying through Breeze and I end up paying more. Nevertheless will never use or recommend this airline as they don't even have a customer service person to speak to and the automated system sucks just like the airline. I give them a -0 as me and the wife worry about our son 12 hrs away and alone in the airport.

### "We were treated so well"
Not Verified |  We were treated so well. The app. would not allow me to pick or seats. When we checked in I told the lady at the check in desk our problem. She assured me that my family and I would be seated together and apologized for the problem. We received our new boarding pass shortly before boarding the flight. To our surprise we were seated in row 6 of the plane. ($140 a piece seats & we paid $39 per seat) I was impressed with the staff. They were all extremely helpful.

### "Was very good for the cost"
Not Verified |  Was very good for the cost, plane was nice, got cheap wifi for only $1. For the low cost, it was very pleasant. Had no problems whatsoever. I'll be using Breeze again if I need a cheap flight.

### "airline changed planes"
I purchased the best seat (nicest) for $354.00. The airline changed planes and transferred me to (Nicer) for approx. $230. They only refunded me $45 and refuse to give me any additional money owed. What a scam to earn extra income. Just think about all the money that can be accumulated at the passengers' expense. Terrible!

### "crew were extremely friendly"
Not Verified | This was my first time flying with breeze. The flight was on time. The cabin crew were extremely friendly. Even the Pilot said a few words in person and on the intercom. He had a great sense of humor. And we bought are tickets at a great price. I thought the seats were comfortable and loved having a USB on the seats. I would highly recommend flying with this airline. Thanks for the Great customer service. I hope it continues. We fly alot and don't see alot of that. Keep up the good work

### "Cabin crew were so nice"
I’m a French citizen and I flew with Breeze Airways from Hartford to Los Angeles on November 3rd to 6th. Cabin crew were so nice. Keep going like this and I hope to fly with you next year when I’ll get back to US. All the best.

### "low frills for a great value"
I have flown Breeze quite a bit lately to visit family in FL. Almost every trip has been pretty pedestrian. Boarding process is very quick because most people are using backpacks. The planes are newer, seats are fairly comfortable except the headrest if you are tall. Services are basic, where you pay for any extras. But for me to be able to travel regularly from BDL or PVD to Florida for 100-130 RT is just a game changer. So to state the obvious, if you are looking for a full service carrier, look elsewhere. If you want a clean, efficient ride, low frills for a great value, breeze is great.

### "not happy with it at all"
Not Verified | I hate to sound rude or disrespectful but I got a flight on Breeze for the first time and I'm not happy with it at all. I never really treat my self and I always end up setting all the way in the back of the plane. This time I decided to treat myself and sit in first class up front it cost me a extra $81.00 there and an extra $81.00 back to sit in first class. One of the perks of setting up front other than the extra space is you also get free snacks and drinks including alcohol beverage. Well it turns out only 2 to 4 people paid for the first class seats. This is what made me mad the empty seats the flight attendees let the people who was setting in the back to come up front and set in the empty seats in first class. I mean what the heck I paid to be up here they didn't so I ask the flight attendants "If I get a refund for this seat considering majority of the people didn't pay to be up here". He replied with a smart response saying "absolutely if you don't mind getting up and go sit in the back. I was speechless knowing if I say anything it would not be good. Then he goes on to welcome everyone saying "How does it feel to sit up front in first class for free? I was sickened by all of this. Then during the flight they all got the free snacks and drinks while everyone else behind us had to pay. The one guy in the seat in front of me tried to pay for him and his wife snacks and drinks but the staff replied to the guy as for some reason look at me as he saying "oh no you don't have to pay, that one of the perks for setting in first class for free. I just rolled my eyes and just look out the window. I mean they didn't even pay extra to be sitting their. So I will definitely not be fly Breeze ever again or pay extra to sit in first class being disrespected when there's a chance I could sit there for free and be talk to like that just the way he said it just really upset me. I tipped all this as I set in first class not caring who beside me behind me and definitely the flight attendees reading what I'm tipping.

### "being able to open the emergency exit"
Not Verified |  The emergency exit row (four seats, two port, two starboard) was occupied by older ladies. I am sure they were nice people, but the last time I sat in an emergency exit seat (male, 5'11", 220, athletic) the flight attendant asked if I had any problems being able to open the emergency exit in case of emergency. If it is so easy an older lady can do it, why ask me? If it is hard to do, shouldn't the nice older ladies be sitting somewhere else? It was curious but not serious until we got to Norfolk and the pilot had to abort the landing and make another go around. The aircraft shook a lot and many of the passengers were frightened.

### "seats were uncomfortable"
Flight was on time and arrived as scheduled. While there was decent room in the seats they were uncomfortable. The seats are poorly padded and not suitable for a 4-5 hour flight. Cabin service was adequate. The forward lavatory was not operational so the entire plane was using one washroom. Overall this flight was average at best. If money is your only concern then this airline will work. If you wish more comfort and service in your flight then avoid this airline. Because they do not staff the check in counter until an hour before boarding the check in becomes a rushed affair if checking bags is involved. Getting a cup of coffee and relaxing before the flight isn't going to happen.

### "went above and beyond the call of duty"
While traveling from MCO to T.F. Green Rhode Island on a Friday evening, I encountered an unexpected hiccup when I reached the TSA checkpoint. My boarding pass displayed "Jumoke" instead of my full name, "Olajumoke," as per my ID, which had been booked by my aunt. With my flight already in the boarding process, TSA directed me back to the Breeze airline check-in desk to rectify my name. After a brief search, I found an invaluable assistant named Priscilla, who promptly corrected my name. I expressed my gratitude and returned to the TSA line, resigned to endure the long queue once more. However, out of the blue, Priscilla reappeared, realizing that I might miss my flight. She guided me back to the initial security checkpoint, and I underwent the necessary security checks, managing to reach my gate just in the nick of time. I was, in fact, the last passenger to board the flight. Priscilla's assistance went above and beyond the call of duty. Individuals like Priscilla at Breeze Airlines make the world a better place. If you happen to encounter Priscilla at the Breeze airline check-in at MCO, please convey my heartfelt thanks, and she truly deserves recognition with a special employee badge. Thank you.

### "made sure I was comfortable"
Not Verified |  Everyone was nice when we boarded. The flight attendants were awesome, they made sure I was comfortable at all time. I suffer from lupus so I had to get up many times. Karimar, Kimberly, and Achalasia, thank you girls. Hand up for our pilot we had a smooth ride. My husband and I already told our family and friends to fly Breeze airways.

### "No customer service"
Not Verified |  I was at the airport prior to boarding even starting. Apparently there is only one person checking bags and she had to go help the gate get ready because they are running a skeleton crew. I had tarmac folks from Delta and United helping me. All in all, I Was there at indicated time by Breeze. Couldn't get bags checked. Flight got delayed 10 mins. Still couldn't get me on my flight. No customer service, not enough staff. There is no phone number so if you need them your screwed. And they wouldn't even refund me. Gave me Breeze points while I drop another $1100 for 2 tickets to Vegas last minute.

### "our experience was wonderful"
Not Verified |  I was skeptical about flying Breeze because of the mixed reviews. However our experience was wonderful - check in and boarding were quick and seamless, we had the breeze seats with extra leg room which were very spacious compared to most flights we have been in, the flights were on time or early both to and from and everyone was very nice all around. This is the only direct flight from Phoenix to Richmond and I would 100% fly it again! Our main goal on an airline is to get from point A to point B as expected and this was a solid experience. If you're hoping for more of the luxurious components of flying this is not the airline for you. But if you want an overall positive flight experience I would absolutely recommend Breeze!

### "Would definitely recommend"
Great new airline with brand new planes. Three classes nice, nicer and nicest. We flew “nicer” It was! Plenty of leg room. Actually has WiFi on board. Pleasant crew and flight. Would definitely recommend Breeze Airlines. It flies to some major cities and more of the remote places. All for flights starting at $45

### "
We had a family emergency in MA. We flew from Vero the week before no issues. We got to the airport well in advance. It took us a hour and 15 mins to get through security (not Breezes fault) but it seems everyone was panicking about missing their flights, and the plane didn’t wait for us. We got to the gate 5-10 mins before take off. There was no one to help us. There’s no customer service number I was given a number to text and email. Got no where. Next flight wasn’t for another 2 days but given my son has school and we have work we needed to get home. So we had to rent a car and drive 22 hours home. Never again.

### "zero real Customer Service"
Not Verified | Want to know how to lose customers? Run an airline like Breeze does. This airline has zero real Customer Service (as indicated by most honest reviews). Impossible to talk to a real person - impossible! If you try to text or email you will wait way beyond the point where they can help you (plus they aren't very helpful). Their website sucks and raises prices as you are trying to pay for your tickets. When someone finally gets back to you (NOT by voice phone, only text several hrs later), they nicely say that there's nothing they can do and will "report" it to management -- Ha, Ha, Ha. We took a flight from LAS-BDL scheduled from 2:00PM pst- 10:00PM est. Actual time -7:30PM - 3:08 AM - gee, that was VERY convenient, wasn't it. And for that inconvenience, they offered $50 to be used on another flight. I just cancelled 2 tickets for my sister ($500 value) and switched them to another airline which might take longer (maybe not with Breeze's NOT ONTIME reputation). As consumers, we can vote with our $$$ and not reward business's that are poorly run and don't understand CUSTOMER SERVICE. You've been WARNED!!! !

### "didn't offer wifi on the trip"
Not Verified |  Plane looked new. We booked the nicest seats (their business class) and my wife's seat foot recliner was broken and they didn't offer wifi on the trip. These were 2 reasons why we booked these seats and paid extra. They didn't even offer us a drink when we initially boarded. They didn't offer to move our seats, even though there were open seats available. There was no in flight entertainment, as well. Not sure if we will fly this airline again.

### "completely on your own if you have issues"
Breeze Airways has horrible customer service. I gate checked a stroller on a flight from CHS to SFO and they lost it. I filed a claim and heard no updates on its location or a timeline for its return. I had to buy a replacement as I had no confidence it would ever be returned. I have a 4 month old and this was my only stroller. You need a stroller with a 4 month old. I eventually got a call from the Airport police department saying the stroller had been left with lost and found. My family had to disrupt their whole day to go claim the stroller from the police department. Breeze has done nothing to address the situation. They did not return the stroller to me (the police did that), they never updated me on the status of the stroller, and they now refuse to pay for the new stroller I purchased. Breeze Airways has barely any customer service to speak of. There is a text line that replies once a week or so and that is it. There is no phone number to call, no online chat, nothing. There is no way to speak to a manager or get any additional help with problems. I will never fly them again and strongly recommend no one else fly them either. You will be completely on your own if you have issues.

### "no way to hold them to their word"
Not Verified |  A month ago, I used Breeze to fly from SFO to RIC due to a death in the family. Plane arrives late and they announce that a mechanical issue was found with a door on the nosecone. Said it was 1/10" out of spec and blah blah. One hour became four and they kept stringing us along until they rescheduled the flight for 1PM the next day, which was 28 hours after I'd arrived at SFO. They didn't cancel the flight, which would entitle passengers to some remediation. I ended up booking a flight with Delta and left the same day, just 12 hours later than originally scheduled. I submitted reimbursement requests as directed, but Breeze never followed up. Not a good experience. On 9/8, we departed from SFO to RIC. I'd booked this flight in March, so I didn't have an option to cancel it without penalty after my last horrible experience. We had a slightly late departure but everything seemed OK. About one or two hours into the flight, a fight broke out. Some person went feral and attacked 2 of the flight attendants and needed three flight attendants and at least two passengers to be subdued. So pilot gets on the radio and says "by FAA regulations, we're required to land for the safety of our staff etc" which was fine. Nobody deserves to be treated that way and the flight crew were completely professional despite what they'd just gone through. However, Breeze stranded everyone at XNA (Bentonville, AR). They said they didn't have the ability to take off again and announced that the next flight out of XNA would not be until 1:30PM tomorrow, delaying our arrival by a day. No assistance with ground transportation, booking hotel rooms, or even up to date information. The Breeze employees at XNA shrugged it off as "well, it's a budget airline" and "submit your reimbursement requests online. For those who aren't familiar with XNA, it's a tiny airport that makes RIC and ORF look huge. Departing flights are extremely limited and therefore pricey to book with no advanced notice. It's also extremely rural, so getting to and from the airport by Uber or Lyft is expensive. We ended up renting a car because it cost less than a round trip on Uber and were lucky to find a hotel room that's 30 minutes away from the airport because the situation quickly deteriorated to "every man for himself. For the uninitiated, Breeze has a portal where you submit reimbursement requests (name, flight details, photos of receipts, etc.). Once you've done so, there's no confirmation or way to track your submission, and they don't follow up. So Breeze might say they'll reimburse you for $150 per person in expenses, but there's no way to hold them to their word.

### "overall great flight"
Not Verified |  We read many bad reviews about Breeze. Surprisingly it was a very smooth and safe flight. We sat in the “nicest” section, first row and had a lot of room and the seats were very comfortable. Although for take off and landing we had to put our personal bags in the overhead bins. It was one of the best flights we’ve had. One downside is that there is no Wi-Fi or tv on the planes but overall great flight and would fly again.

### "not recommend this airline"
Not Verified |  The airline has no customer service support. On a nonstop flight from California to Florida they provide little or no snacks unless you buy them. Their are not consistent with time. They were late leaving California then on my return flight from Florida to California they left thirty five minutes before time leaving me stranded at the airport where I had to book another flight because they only had one flight heading to California for the entire day. Horrible experience, I will not recommend this airline to anyone.

### "Done with this airline"
Not Verified |  We traveled with my 92 year old mother-in-law for a return flight home from a family reunion. She required a wheelchair from the gate to the baggage claim. We had to wait for a wheelchair to become available which was understandable. We volunteered to push the wheelchair to baggage claim because they were short staffed, also understandable. When we arrived at the carousel, another woman in a wheelchair from our flight took off her luggage. We waited for our luggage to come around, but there was no luggage left on the carousel. We asked security what to do and they said go to the Breeze ticket counter, but the employee who was walking out the door ignored me when I asked about the missing luggage and walked out of the airport. I tried to contact Breeze, but the only way to reach them was by text. No customer service phone number. Ifinally received an answer to my text the next day and they said the luggage was unclaimed at the airport and we needed to pick it up. The airport is 2 hours from home and they refused to mail it back because it was not their fault. A supervisor when I asked to speak to one said the same thing. Done with this airline.

### "experience has been pretty awful"
The whole experience has been pretty awful. First off our flight got delayed 2 hours for seemingly no reason. My wife and I checked out bags together and got on the flight no problem. Staff was friendly enough, plane was clean, but these are no the reasons I'm leaving a poor review. We had a 2 hour direct flight from Portland, ME to Norfolk, VA. We were the last flight out of Portland Maine and somehow my suitcase did not arrive. (My wife's luggage arrived no problem). I'm a very patient guy and can go with the flow so this didn't bother me too much, things happen right? However; where I am getting very annoyed is the inability to deal with customer service. We created a claim with the fellow at baggage claim, he assured us someone would be reaching out to us, we have heard nothing. We have checked in with automated chat which is 100% impossible to get a human on the line. They describe the process as being customer centric and they don't have humans so they can provide cheaper prices for flights. While this may be true about cheaper flights, it is absolutely doing all of their customers a disservice. We keep getting the same automated response asking me to describe the bag which we have done several times. 50% of the time it seems we are getting no response at all. My luggage is gone, I have no idea how to even begin to create a solution for this. I will never fly another airline that has this "non-human" component to it again. This has made my trip very difficult and I see no solution in sight. I am very persistent and will continue to push until I find a solution no matter how difficult this journey is. However; save your self the headache and fly another airline, Breeze Airways get a huge FAIL on this one.

### "Massive delays for no reason"
Massive delays for no reason they don't not care. Customer service unempathetic which is why they use a email or text function rather than the customer service line. On average was delayed for 4 to 5 hours both ways. I wouldn't sit for long is playing unless they gave it for free

### "a very good experience"
Not Verified | This was the first time I had flown on a no frills airline and it was a very good experience. When I booked the flight, they only had one option for departure time. I am in my 70s and leaving RDU at 9:20pm is pretty late and leaving BDL at 7am is pretty early but, I will do it again, if necessary. It looks like they have added a Sunday afternoon flight from RDU now. All the employees were very pleasant and helpful when asked. I was very happy with the money I saved and everything about my trip with Breeze.

### "No one will help you"
Not Verified |  As soon as I booked my flight for 30+ days out the flight was canceled within 24 hours and another flight was booked for 26 hours later than my original flight option I chose. I asked for a refund as I could not make that flight option work, and these guys are impossible to get a hold of. It’s 18 days later and I still have not received my money. Priceline cannot help and Breeze Airways is repetitive with their automated responses and takes you in circles. No one will help you.

### "Breeze has a good product and plan"
Not Verified |  After my daughter had a nightmare experience in Charlotte with American Airlines, I decided to search again for non-stop options between SAV and BDL, I was tired of having to switch planes and worry about missing a connection. I know that Jetblue does non-stop to BOS from SAV, but BDL is 30 minutes away and BOS is 90 minutes and BDL is a much less hectic airport, plus, Jetblue has now become one of the most expensive airlines. I was surprised to find direct flights via Breeze on WED and SAT and decided to try it. Plus, $49 base price allowed me to upgrade to their "nicer" seating for a very good price. The flight left on time, the crew was friendly, the plane was new and clean, and the flight was smooth. Avoiding the hassle and worry of having to connect in a busy airport is well worth it. I see the negative comments and the problems that people have experienced, Breeze has a good product and plan, I hope that they learn from their mistakes and improve.

### "a variety of issues”
So, appreciated the direct service from JAX to LAX (the only one available) but, as a first time Breeze flyer have a variety of “issues”: flew “first class” yet boarding was not staggered so they called all zones at once (huh?). By the time I got in there was no bag space anywhere near my row (silly/easily avoidable). Brought my iPad for entertainment but as we settled in at 30,000 feet was told that if I didn’t have the App / paid for service (which you couldn’t do in flight) you were out of luck—this should be written in bold letters on the side of the plane! A five hour flight without internet or entertainment, lovely. Finally, I appreciate the free M&Ms but asking me to pay for the only food option—crackers/cheese—was a bit much. CRAZY IDEA: for long haul flights charge a few $ more (after all, you have a monopoly on the route) and provide free food options (how about a sandwich?) for first class. Appreciate the idea/need for Breeze but monopolies fail for a reason—poor customer service. One final thought on culture. Given the economy-first customer-second ethos, I found the in flight crew less than friendly or accommodating. Culture has a way of infecting everything - unfortunately!

### "so much better than other options"
We flew the LA to Providence non stop. Had first class seats. It was so much better than other west coast options to the west coast from Providence. Non stop makes a world of difference. Would fly breeze again.

### "lack of customer service"
Prior to arriving I was unable to check in on the app, when we arrive the agent told us it was $50 instead of the $35 that was listed on the app to check bags, but their app has been having issues so gave me their phone number to issue a refund. I text & receive a response over 12 hours later not admitting fault to the app having issues although I proceeded to provide a snapshot of the App Store “bug fixes” and unwilling to make up the difference, continuing to be rude and place the blame on me for not emailing when the app was having issue. Yes, this review is over a total of $45. Also, when I was on the plans and went to order the meat & cheese snack on a 5 hour flight they had “ran out” which left the option for junk food. No WiFi and the seats were the worst I’ve ever experienced. This won’t turn me away from a cheap airline but I wanted everyone to know about the lack of customer service, I guess you get what you pay for.

### "doubt if I’ll ever fly Breeze again"
My first flight was canceled after many delays. Showed up for my new flight almost 24 hours later. Again, delay, delay, delay. Finally got to my destination at midnight and sat on the plane for 30 minutes before we could get off the plane. No offer of compensation for meals, overnight stay or inconvenience. Offered $100 credit, but after this fiasco, I doubt if I’ll ever fly Breeze again!

### "the staff was wonderful"
The flight was on time the staff was wonderful. I paid for nicer so everything was elevated. It was really nice. Security was a breeze and the desk at the door was as well. Hats off to you.

### "don't want any future flight with you"
Not Verified | Will never book a flight with this airline. I book a flight for somebody else. Something came up and I need to cancel the flight. Well it's nearly impossible. There's no customer service that you can call. I googled it and found out I need to create an account to be able to do anything. So I created an account under my name, look up the flight using confirmation #. Well it's not found. Changed the account name to the passenger name, that didn't work either. Finally, I found a number. Some  lady answered, after explaining my whole situation, she requested that I send her the confirmation #. She couldn't find it because it hasn't been upload. I said to her, I have the email from breeze airways with confirmation number. What do you mean it hasn't been uploaded. Then I sent to her a different email from Priceline (where I booked the ticket). After she put me on hold like 5-6 times over the course of an hour, I finally got an email from her asking if I agree to the cancellation. I replied yes but I need to attach a picture of my ID. She explained to me it will be 99 dollars. I said ok fine. All of a sudden I get an email from my bank there's been a $99 transaction that I need to confirm. So I asked why am I being charge an extra $99 (on top of the ticket). I asked her, why can't you just deduct the $99 from the ticket and refund me the remaining amount. She said it will be refund to my bank (don't know when) or I will get credit back for future flight with them. Now I'm just hoping I will get the money back into my account instead of having to pay an extra $99 and still some dumb credit through them and having to fly with them in the future. No I don't want any future flight with you.

### "I was pleasantly surprised"
Not Verified |  Very good. I would very likely fly with Breeze again. All that I expect is a good price (easily best price.) Be on time. Seats were comfy although a lil snug I've never read a good review of Breeze,(this goes back to time when Southwest cancelled a ton of flights- Breeze did as well. I was pleasantly surprised, and will book travel with Breeze again.

### "customer service is non-existent"
Breeze customer service capability is non-existent. On this flight from CVG to SFO, they lost my suitcase. Now I am in San Francisco for 2 weeks with no clothes, no toilet goods, no medications, and I am missing several items I need for my work. There was no one in the baggage area to help me with this problem I went to the Breeze ticket counter and talked to the only person there. She told me she would have to contact her customer service people via a messaging app. She tried to do this. I waited for a response for over an hour to no avail. I asked her how to follow up and she told me to contact Breeze via text messaging or Facebook messenger. I have tried repeatedly to do both over the past 24 hours. I have received no response and no acknowledgement of my messages. Breeze has no customer service capability. No telephone contact number. No response capability to text messaging or Facebook messenger. Anyone who flies on this airline should be prepared for losing any checked baggage with no recourse from the airline By all appearances, it is a poorly run, poorly managed business. I hope that the managers of this business are better at pilot hiring/training and plane maintenance than they are at customer service.

### "my first and last trip with Breeze"
If you are flying Breeze, do not worry about getting to the airport early for security. Because you will be waiting at least an hour for your flight because it will definitely be delayed! And right now as I write this we are sitting in the plane not moving not at the gate. Today be my first and last trip with Breeze. I mean seriously, do better!

### "Prepare to be delayed"
Prepare to be delayed. Do not think even for a second that you will make the connecting flight/cruise so just don’t do it to yourself. I was supposed to board at 6:20pm but didn’t board until 11pm. Same thing happened on the way back. Never will I take this again. They clearly don’t value my time and I would much rather take Spirit, they are at least professional.

### "impossible to actually speak to a person"
Not Verified | Worst airline. Flew from Pittsburgh to Jacksonville, Fla to visit my very sick mother. Arrived in Jacksonville, but no luggage arrived. Filed a claim at the front desk, and was assured they would contact me the next day. Suffice to say that that was on July 6th. I still have no luggage and no response for the airline as of July 27th. I have texted them repeatedly with my claim number, and never receive a response. It is impossible to actually speak to a person. If you do fly, do not pay to check a bag!

### "Thank you for not being like the rest"
The Greatest Captain ever! Arriving sweaty at the my gate 8mins after the place was supposed to TAKE OFF, the door was SHUT! Then! Captain stepped out of the loading bridge’s door. He said that there was a slight weight problem they were handling at the moment and he would happy to escort me down to the plane. Here I sit, the happiest man to ever sit in the very back of an airplane. Thank you Breeze Airlines. Thank you for not being like the rest.

### "Worst airline experience"
Worst airline experience of my life. Delayed on the runway before take off for 4 hours due to “a paperwork issue” caused by the airline. You would think that after causing such a delay they might try to make everyone happy by offering snacks or beverages for free, but no. No acknowledgement of fault by the crew. When we arrived at our destination we waited on the runway for 2 more hours for a terminal to open up. The airline offered a $50 credit towards a future flight for me, but didn’t offer one for my two year old son whose seat I paid for. It doesn’t matter anyways because I’ll never fly this airline again.

### "horrible customer service"
Not Verified | Breeze Airways left my bag at the first stop Richmond, Virginia and when I got to Las Vegas they did not have my bag sent to me for two more days. This was half of my trip. I was told to go purchase clothing and send them receipts via text message, which there is no human to ever speak with. They have been promising me a reimbursement, which is not even close to what I spent on clothing for three months now and I still have not received it now they don't even respond to my text messages. I have text messages going back three weeks with no response. I think this is a total scam. I don't think they ever have any intention of reimbursing any funds at all they also broke the wheels off of my boyfriends bag and we're attaching a reimbursement to my claim for a very limited amount which is nowhere near what the luggage cost horrible horrible customer service if that's what you want to call it you will never ever get a human. Everything is done via text or email and it is automated. very upsetting, considering the owner is also the owner of JetBlue..

### "9.5 hours of delays"
Not Verified |  Constant delays. No one has any idea when flight will actually depart. 9.5 hours of delays at the moment, promising it will not be cancelled. Staff has no idea of actual procedures. Rescue flight is on the way, will be here in 50 minutes. Hours later we're still here with a $20 voucher for food.

### "Will never fly this airline again"
Paid for 1 piece of luggage. Never arrived. Filled out A lost form, No contact to me about lost luggage status for 4 days. The airline has no phone number. Can they track luggage? Will never fly this airline again.

### "fail miserably on the reimbursement process"
I have flown Breeze several times and was beginning to enjoy their airline. Then flying back from Las Vegas my plane arrived at the gate on time. Then they had some kind of issue with how the plane was docked at the gate. They tried for a couple of hours to fix it. They boarded us. Then they had software problems, or something. Then after a couple of hours they had us get off the plane because it was getting too hot in the Las Vegas summer sun. Who knew Las Vegas gets hot in the Summer? Apparently not Breeze. After a few more hours they decided they could not get the plane fixed or cooled down and sent all of the passengers away saying that you could either rebook on another airline (although there really weren't more than a couple of expensive seats on those other airlines) or get a hotel room on Breeze for the night. That's where the problems begin again. I got a room at a nearby Holiday Inn Express, nothing lavish. Cost ~$135. After I book the room Breeze sends an email and says you only have 6 days to apply for a hotel reimbursement and $20 for one meal. My total very inexpensive meals were ~$80 for dinner and breakfast. Plus an UBER back and forth to the airport. Breeze  so far has only reimbursed me $20 and if I accept that payment I must click on an agreement that binds me to that settlement. They are all talk at the airport about how great they will be, and then they fail miserably on the reimbursement process.

### "definitely fly Breeze again"
My husband and I were very comfortable and happy with everything about Breeze Airways. Our flights took off and landed on time, flight attendants were very professional and kind. Will definitely fly Breeze again.

### "they don’t deserve one penny of your money"
This is the worst airline experience I’ve ever had. I saw a poster for Breeze in the Provo airport. I have flown on Allegiant many times between Provo and Phoenix for work, but no flight was available on my desired day of travel so I decided to give them a try. The actual flight was fine, on time, very clean new plane, no bells and whistles but I didn’t expect any, even though I paid $200 for a one way ticket including paying for my checked bag. And here becomes the issue. I spent over an hour in Phoenix baggage claim and my suitcase never showed up. Happens, right? Not like this. There is no one at a ticket counter, no one in baggage claim, NO ONE TO CALL. That’s right, they do not speak to their passengers by phone. My options to locate my bag were text, email or Facebook messenger (seriously). I would never have flown an airline that doesn’t provide customer service by phone had I known. I sent an email and text only to receive an automatic reply to please allow up to TWO WEEKS for a response. WHAT? I paid to check this bag and they lost it after an hour long flight and now I can’t contact anyone to find it. It’s so upsetting and appalling. As I began to inventory the lost items my panic, frustration and nausea grew. I have sent messages daily for the last five days, finally received an email with a lost bag claim number, no apology, no recourse, the email said I could text to ask about reimbursement to the number I already texted with no response. How can a business treat its customers like this? I don’t get it. I have worked in hospitality for 25+ years and this is just dumbfounding. What about brand loyalty? Repeat customers? Not if they don’t care enough to have someone answer the phone when losing their personal property! The worst part, staff in the departing, arrival and flight continuing airports have all told me that this happens all the time. They see people wander around baggage claim and then begin to realize their bags are gone and there’s no one to talk to, no one who cares. I’ve had substantially better treatment from the airport information desk than the airline I paid to entrust with my bag. Don’t fly this airline. The “economy” price is even that cheap and they don’t deserve one penny of your money.

### "impressed with this airline"
Not Verified |  I really was impressed with this airline and the plane it was soo clean and comfortable. The staff were very nice.

### "unprofessional traveling experience"
Not Verified | My first trip with Breeze. I arrived at 7:00 AM for a 9:30 departure. Check in smooth, delay announced for 11:05. The plane made it to the takeoff spot then engine light came on. Sat and waited for tug to come take plane back to gate. Tug wouldn't work so another tug was called. Several announcements made regarding maintenance needed, last one said brakes need to be repaired. Sat at gate for awhile, it was 3:30 pm and was told no departure info available. Several of us asked to cancel and Breeze attendant said yes, your luggage would be taken off and we could pickup at carousel 3. Waited at carousel 3 for awhile, no luggage. No one had any idea where it was. Waited two days and no one knows where my luggage was. I was told I could buy clothes and toiletries and would be reimbursed. Received a text message saying my luggage went to Los Angeles, CA. Luggage showed up at my home over two weeks later since found. Luggage receipts sent three days to the Breeze telephone number they gave me to use. It was six weeks yesterday, I haven't received one penny of my money spent on clothes/toiletries. I have sent numerous messages to the "one number" they gave me to communicate with. They replied once and said they would review the receipts and get back to me within four weeks. It had been over six weeks and they stopped replying to me. They now send an autogenerated response that says thankyou for sending your receipts. There is no way to have human contact and their website doesn't provide any further info either. By the way, they don't have a way to provide reviews either. The whole Breeze Airline experience has been awful. No one accepts responsibility or even tries to make my horrible experience better. I know planes are delayed and luggage gets lost/mishandled but at least apologize and make things right after your policy and your employee states a reimbursement is allowed. I had absolutely no clothes/shoes/toiletries for my seven day vacation. That was the first time I made reservations with Breeze and my last!! I have travelled many times in my life and never experienced such an unprofessional traveling experience in my 62 years of life. They ruined my vacation, lost my luggage and will not accept responsibility or pay me back for any of clothes/shoes/toiletries I needed to be on vacation.

### "massive delays for no reason"
Flew Breeze July 7th I arrived at airport at 5PM for a 7PM flight, was supposed to leave out of Tampa at 7:00pm to go to Providence, was delayed for “weather conditions” meanwhile every plane in the airport is still coming in and out and once actually on the plane had to wait an additional 30 minutes for a “new pilot” to come. We didn’t depart until 10:30 PM. Coming back on July 10th from Providence to Tampa I had hope that everything would go smooth and it would be a fluke. My flight was at 3PM and didn’t depart until 7PM. In total I experienced 7hrs of delays for “weather conditions”. If you plan on flying, just expect massive delays for no reason. Been flying for 10 years and have never experienced two 3hr delays going both ways for “weather conditions” that were non existent.

### "Not worth the headache"
Not Verified |  Do not book with this airline! Very unprofessional. Sat in Tampa for 3 hours because flight was delayed due to weather but the weather was not bad at all, very sunny. Sat on the plane for additional 1 hour because they could not find the pilot. On my way back now and same thing is happening flight is being delayed. Not worth the headache.

### "everything went smoothly"
I had no delays or cancelations, everything went smoothly, and the staff was friendly. I worried that I'd have a bad experience based on other reviews, so I wanted to be sure to include a positive one on here.

### "they lost one of our two bags"
Direct flight and they lost one of our two bags, no customer support to get it back. Bag was never unloaded from plane and arrived back at 7pm that night but nobody called. Had to spend all weekend without luggage. Checking in the staff couldn't even remove cost paid for luggage. Zero customer support.

### "Deplorable. Will never use again"
Horrible. I flew my children (8, 11, 13 and 15) down last month - no problem just like multiple times before. I booked and paid for them to come down this weekend - Breeze canceled their reservation without notifying me because their policy changed on unaccompanied minors. No notice, no attempt to contact me to see if I could add an adult, just cancelled. Contacted their so called customer support and all I got was a matter of fact type “now you will have to accompany your children or have someone over 18 travel with you children”. Deplorable. Will never use again.

### "most amazing flight attendants"
Not Verified |  I was really nervous initially due to all the reviews regarding Breeze. Especially the delays and cancellations that people were really upset about. I felt the need to leave this review from my personal opinion. I flew PHX to Bradley round trip. Both flights were exactly on time. I also read reviews about the seats being small, uncomfortable etc and I was surprised to see what they actually seemed bigger than Delta. I slept my initial flight but the flight back to Phoenix from Bradley I had the most amazing flight attendants. I was really anxious and the flight seemed to be taking forever so I got up to walk around and went to the back and ask the flight attendant how much longer we had. She let me know and asked if there’s anything she can do for us.. she got me and my daughter cups of water and started talking to me for a little bit because I think she knew I was getting really bored (she was really really awesome!)

### "no one from Breeze was around to talk to"
Breeze Airways plane from Hartford was very nice, the staff was nice, unfortunately they had to stop in Charleston. The change over was quite quick 35 minutes. When we landed they had lost our luggage and no one from Breeze was around to talk to or get help from. They have a number you can text. I had to go back to the airport the next day, wait for 2 hours before I could talk with a live person. Their hands were tied as they also had limited resources. They filed a claim and told me someone would call me within 24 hours. I received a text alert that my claim was filed but no one contacted me. I texted everyday with no response. Upon leaving today we checked in and they said our bags arrived and that they would put them on the plane for our return. Unfortunately our direct flight home has now been changed to a stop in Arkansas which now gets us in after midnight when we were supposed to arrive at 10pm.

### "Wanted to give them a chance"
Not Verified |  Two hour delay due to a "maintenance issue" they made up no time while in the air. Then once we arrive, sitting for another 20 minutes because their delay allowed another plane to take our place to dock. Over it. Wanted to give them a chance because of the direct flight option to a smaller airport. Might as well take a flight with another airline with layovers. Same amount of time flying.

### "Would not recommend"
Incredible kind staff but absolute garbage experience. Flight delayed initially two hours because plane stuck on east coast. Then when it arrived we had to deplane to reboot computer on plane, now an additional 2.5 hrs late. Arrived at 1:15am providence and still waiting as of 2:15am for baggage to show up due to staffing issues. Would not recommend.

### "Where is my luggage?"
Where is my luggage? It somehow didn't make it on my 7hr delayed flight home from Hartford to Tampa 7 days ago. Still no luggage delivered to me! The text line person told me it would be Thursday and here we are. Beyond ridiculous!

### "not a honorable company"
I don’t even know where to start. I first received an email the morning of our travel that said the flight would have a two hour delay. Delays happen and usually you plan your trip around short delays. Second email said 3 hour delay. It happens. Leading up to boarding, no further delay notifications were received. No communication at all. The gate agents would not talk to anyone and they weren’t even present at the desk. Extremely rude anytime someone tried to ask why they wouldn’t communicate with passengers. They very clearly didn’t work for breeze, they were probably cheap contractors that clearly didn’t give a damn about any of us. After hours and hours a gate agent finally announced on the intercom that she would provide an update to concerned travelers within a couple minutes. Hours passed by without any updates. When it was time to board they began a roll call which was very confusing and they gave no information as to why they had to do a roll call. Almost 9 hours late the flight left LAX. People on the plane were having panic attacks and no information was being provided to calm passengers down. People started asking to get off the plane and they were told they couldn’t get off even though the cabin was overheating. Finally, once at the destination Breeze just “lost” all the bags. Waited over an hour for bags. It’s not my first time flying and I know things happen but Breeze, by far, handled mistakes worse than any airline I have ever flown. Unacceptable. The pilot even admitted how embarrassed he was and told passengers they should demand refunds but I have a feeling this is not a honorable company. I’d love for them to prove me wrong but I’m not confident they will. I’ll never fly Breeze again.

### "now they wont refund me"
Not Verified |  Flew Breeze for the first time and horrible experience. I cant believe in today's world a service provider would not have a customer service department. Any concerns or questions you have take 2 weeks to get responded to because you cant contact an actual customer service person. My flight was delayed 7 hrs. They then sent email asking for volunteers to give up seat because the long delay created an oversold situation. We were the first volunteer. So they refunded my ticket and said to buy on another carrier that day and they would refund me the difference. Now they are saying they made an error and wont refund me the difference. Not only was my trip delayed an entire day but now they wont refund me the money promised despite all the emails from them stating otherwise.

### "waiting hours for someone to show up"
Not Verified |  This is not for the ride to or from. It's the terminal for Breeze check in and bag checking, waiting hours for someone to show up and check my bag in. So far I have waited 4 hours for someone to show up and check the bags of not just me, but everyone else in front of me and beyond me in freaking.

### "Do not fly with this airline"
Do not fly with this airline. Pay more money for another. Trust me! Flight was delayed by 8 hours. They made us sit on the plane for 2 hours because they screwed up booking. Offered you nothing besides cookies for their multiple major mistakes. I usually understand delays, but they really screwed up. The flight should have been cancelled. They were selfish by not cancelling and refunding. DO NOT FLY with Breeze Airways.

### "Overall disappointed"
Initially, our flight was going smooth. The cabin staff was nothing special, departed on time. The seats were average. A little extra legroom than I expected. Upon arrival, we were told our gate was occupied and we would be parking in around 30 minutes. 30 minutes came and went. Not a single announcement was made. The only information that I received was from overhearing a flight attendant saying “We don’t really know what we’re gonna do at this point.” We are waiting for a delayed flight to push out of our gate, seems normal enough. For context we are at Norfolk. There are more open gates than occupied gates. I almost guarantee the ground crew is understaffed. Our plane is scheduled to continue to New Orleans at 12:30. It’s 12:26 and I am still sitting on the plane. Overall disappointed in the level of communication from the crew. We have received two announcements, one at the beginning, and one at the end. Nothing was said to us during the 45+ minute wait for our gate. Also, no compensation or vouchers were offered at the point I posted this review.

### "Don’t ever fly with these clowns"
Sent a friend to Raleigh on the morning flight of June 22. Was scheduled for 7am, didn’t depart until after 1pm. Picked up my wife on the evening flight from Raleigh. Was scheduled to arrive by 4pm, it is 10pm and she still isn’t here. The plane didn’t depart until after 8pm and is taking more than 40 minutes since landing to disembark. As of writing my wife is still held captive by Breeze and unable to leave the plane in Jacksonville. The taxi and gate process takes longer than the flight itself This airline is total garbage. Don’t ever fly with these clowns.

### "Absolutely no customer service"
Not Verified |  Absolutely no customer service. Three emails to the supposed customer service email with no response. Text message and Facebook messenger options only respond with preprogrammed responses that don’t address anything sent in original message. Horrible experience. Flight boarded on time but we had over 3 hours of delay while being stuck in our seats and told we couldn’t use the restroom because the plane continued to leave and return to the gate. This occurred at least 4 times with only one communication from the captain on issues, delays etc. Many passengers repeatedly asked what was going on or asked to have the captain's update repeated because the intercom cut out for the majority of him talking. Attendants were not friendly or helpful; saying they didn’t know anything and that captain would update soon then walking away to the very back/front areas of the plane. Multiple passengers were told to sit back down when they attempted to get up to use the restroom.

### "You have a loyal customer in me"
I’m a Platinum Exec with AA and Silver Medallion with Delta and while they both do a fair job, they could learn a thing or two from Breeze! The first class experience is equally good if not better than AA or Delta for half the price. Sure they don’t have all the routes as the majors but if you find yourself lucky enough to in Breeze territory, do it! I’ve had 2 small delays so far and, get this, without even asking, both times, by the time I landed they had added money to my breeze points. And not an insignificant amount either. I sat on a tarmac for 6 hours and didn’t even get an apology from AA! FAs are all young kids learning the business but eager to help and bright eyed and bushy tailed. They have all are so polite and charismatic . I’ve loved several of their pre flight speeches. Very funny. Keep it up Breeze! You have a loyal customer in me.

### "don’t compensate for any inconvenience"
I was originally suppose to depart at the 12:30 in the afternoon after receiving three emails that my flight would be delayed three times. I was then suppose to board at 4 and depart at 4:30 which the boarding process nearly didn’t begin until 5. Most do not plan for a major delay of their paying customers times and then don’t compensate for any inconvenience due to the emails being sent at 2 in the morning.

### "Quick and easy service!"
Quick and easy service! Didn’t take bags for the short flight so not sure about that part. Updates throughout the pre boarding process and emails. The most roomy seats as well coming from a former flight attendant.

### "great flight in both directions"
I hadn't even heard of Breeze when I booked a non-stop round-trip ticket from Las Vegas to Richmond, Virginia. They had just added this obscure route. No one else offered a direct flight and they were $300 less then a similar flight that included one stop en route. Prior to booking, I checked out the reviews and overall rating, and prepared for late flights and lost luggage—none of which happened. Great value, excellent flight on a new Airbus A220. Excellent crew and in-terminal check-in staff, both in Las Vegas and Richmond. On both ends the flights left on time and arrived ahead of time and the baggage service was fast. Instead of using the terms economy and first-class, they offer: nice, nicer and nicest more inclusive terminology. With Breeze, you have to do everything online and my recommendation would be to first time flyers to set up a real account first (not a guest account) and book the ticket. I booked as a guest then setup a real account, but they can't merge the two accounts. They deleted the guest account, but all of the texts for upgrades took me to the new account which didn't have my trip listed. I'm sure that will resolve itself when I book the next ticket. All communication is via email or online and it takes a day or two to get a response. It was a great flight in both directions.

### "Always late, always a different reason"
Not Verified |  I have flown Breeze almost exclusively between Charleston and west Chester/White Plains. The outbound from Charleston is a disaster. Always late, always a different reason. Yesterday was 90 minutes late, with different excuses than previous flights. A recent flight was 4 hours late due to crew issues. Yesterday’s flight was at 5:00 Pm, delayed to 6;30, then to 7;30 and then moved back to 5:30. Actually airborne around 7:00PM. Plane was sitting there at 3:00 so no clue why we couldn’t fly on time. This time they used a excuse of thunderstorms in the area! Not sure what weather service they subscribe to. The boarding process is generally every man for himself. I am thrilled to get a warm glass of water. I have 1 return flight to Charleston and then I’m done with them. Perhaps instead of expanding they should solidify their existing routes. I know it’s less expensive, but time is money so don’t waste your time or money with these guys!

### "Fully plan to fly Breeze again"
Breeze was excellent! I was able to check in through the website (don't make an account - just enter last name and confirmation number) to download my boarding pass. I bought the Nicer ticket, so a checked bag was already included! My first flight out of New Orleans was delayed due to weather, but the crew was very nice and as soon as we were clear for take off we left and the pilot made up a lot of time in the air. Coming home was just as easy as going. The seats were very spacious, the flight attendants were super polite, and the captain was personable too. Fully plan to fly Breeze again. Great experience and a much better price than the "big" airlines.

### "Good flight for the price"
Not Verified |  Good flight for the price, when I could actually get on the airplane. Reaching someone is impossible. BDL - JAX : Before I even traveled I experiences problems with Breeze Airway. The day before I was to depart, my flight was cancelled in the middle of the night due to "Staff Unavailability. I had to reach out to Breeze via the APP to schedule another flight, which was the next day. My first day's trip was totally wasted. The next day, the flight went without any problems. Airport staff at check in were helpful and polite. JAX - BDL: On my way back, we arrived 2 hours early. However, Breeze Airway arbitrarily decided to depart nearly an hour early than scheduled (I received NO notification of this change). I realized the Breeze Airway baggage check in were not available to check my bags, so I had to rush through security and have someone put my bags under the plane right at the terminal. I'm lucky they had enough basic communication to tell their staff my bag was a last minute addition under the plane, but thanks to zero confirmation my bag was physically handled, I worried my bag was going to be left in JAX during the whole flight. I got my bag, though, no problems. Overall: The only reason I'm giving a 6/10 is the flight itself was adequate, and affordable. Acceptable spacing, and the flight got me where I needed to go safely. However, the sudden changes are a nightmare, making me wonder if I should routinely risk the potential of my travel plans on Breeze Airway's sudden whims? I was NOT happy with the lack of available people at baggage check in, as well as through online, phone, or even at the terminal (until boarding started). I had no phone number to call someone in-person, so much of my plans were just leaps of faith. I sent an email, and days later I receive an automated message which directed me towards a different automated solution. I need a physical person to talk to! Some problems can't be solved by yes or no answers. Advice: 1. Constantly check the status of your flight for sudden changes. 2. Arrive 3 hours early, just incase Breeze arbitrarily decides to change the departure time. 3. Arrive two hours before scheduled flight takeoff to ensure you get your baggage checked in. If you miss check in (you'll know when no one is at the counter and it's within 1 1/2 hours before your flight leaves), just go directly to your terminal and have it checked under the plane right at the terminal. Hope they actually do it. 4. Your only way to contact someone (reliably) is either through email where you'll have to wait, OR at baggage check in/boarding - because other than that, you will notget ahold of anyone at Breeze. It's like they're a ghost, a mirage. 5. If you're using Breeze for a business trip, make sure your flight is at least 2 days before you need to be at your destination. This is just in case Breeze decides to cancel your flight last minute, and you're forced to schedule the next day. Then, hope that second flight actually takes off.

### "the crew was delightful"
I was very hesitant to use Breeze after reading the reviews but I had no choice as I had to tend to family across the country. They have nonstop flights to exactly where I needed to go. The first roundtrip was ok. There was a delay and the plane was diverted. They had to switch out for a smaller plane which resulted in a fuel stop. All understandable. Communication was the only complaint but I found all the info I needed on FlightAware. My second roundtrip was flawless. The flight was reasonable in cost, nonstop across country, no delays, fairly new , comfortable and clean aircraft, chargers on the seats, and best of all, the crew was delightful. They go out of their way to make you comfortable andwere very empathetic to all of us. They offered above and beyond the complimentary service. I felt very comfortable on the flight because of them. Not many snack offerings but the amount of money I saved does not warrant the complaint.

### "luggage was left on the tarmac"
I booked a flight for my 79 year old mother and my teenage grandkids from Southern Oregon to Syracuse NY. It was more cost effective to take a flight from MFR to LAS, spend the night and fly direct the next day. Everything went well until they landed in Syracuse and were told that there luggage was left on the tarmac! That was Friday June 8th. It's now Monday June 12th. Still no luggage. My mother and grandkids had no change of clothes! Finally, they had to go buy new items so that they could change their clothes. You cannot speak to a live person! Someone Finally responded to text messages but are giving pushback on money for a change of clothes. The Breeze ground crew left their luggage. Initially, we were excited to find a cost effective airline to travel across country, but after this, not going to happen.

### "attendants were very nice"
Took Breeze from RDU to JAX today. Flight boarded and left on time and arrived 15-20 minutes early. Flight attendants were very nice. No issues with the flight at all. Will definitely fly with again.

### "The worst I’ve ever experienced"
The worst I’ve ever experienced. Postponed flight multiple times, sent conflicting text messages, lost bags, no response on their "customer support", 5 days and my bag is still lost. Not one human to be able to contact. I’ve driven all the way back to the airport multiple times and still no one can help me find my bags. I wouldn’t fly with them again.

### "rob the passenger leaving stranded"
Scheduled flight boarding was 5:55am. Departure was 6:25am I arrived at the gate 6:10am, while door was closed. There was no announcement. Just the final boarding alert at 5:55 am that’s where boarding supposed to start. Security check took 13 min. They shut the door even knowing I was coming and aircraft had not left yet. Their bridge was still attached. These people are so evil intended to rob the passenger leaving stranded.

### "flight will not depart on time"
If you need to be somewhere on time, do not fly Breeze. I have flown them multiple times, and my family has flown them multiple times to see me. Unless you have the first flight out of the day, your flight will not depart on time. They will likely delay it 3-4 times (not exaggerating) and then you'll get to the airport and your departure time will pass, zero announcement, and you will have not boarded your flight. But you get what you pay for.

### "Every step of my trip was phenomenal"
I fly from coast to coast at least twice a year and have always had layovers, I'm used to it but when I saw that Breeze Airways was offering direct flights to Los Angeles, I booked it immediately. I didn’t expect my experience to be so outstanding. Every step of my trip beginning from checking in on the app, checking my luggage and the trip itself was phenomenal. Icing on the cake, we got to my destination 45 minutes earlier! How often does that happen. The price was almost the same as the airline my bags fly free but it made up for being a direct flight. I will definitely fly Breeze Airways again.

### "Bereavement credits are not offered"
Not Verified |  I initially booked a direct flight but the flight plan was changed approximately two weeks prior to our departure. The stop in Charleston, SC which was approximately over an hour and caused our flight time to be over 7 hours rather than less than 5 hours as initially planned. My family and I flew from Hartford, CT to Phoenix, AZ on May 31st for my daughter’s graduation and my mother was traveling with a portable oxygen compressor which has a limited charge on the two batteries. The flight staff were very helpful and professional and this complaint doesn’t have anything to do with them. Corporate changed the flight plan after we booked and we paid for a direct flight. The day before our return flight, my mother was hospitalized and the morning of our planned return flight (June 4th), my mother passed away suddenly. I tried to change the flights for myself and cancel my mother’s due to her death but, the app wouldn’t allow me to change or cancel only my mom’s flight and my own. I sent a text to the number that’s stated online but I didn’t hear back from anyone or at least not a human for hours after my text message on June 4th at 10:56am. I finally received a response on June 5th at 6:56pm (Hello Ida our condolences on the loss of your mom). I’m assuming the very nice young lady at the ticket counter forwarded the information about the loss of my mother. I responded with, thank you. Any chance I could get a credit for the flights my mom and I weren’t able to use? And, their response was were sad to hear about your loss and our thoughts are with you. Bereavement credits are not offered, but we hope our low fares allow you to be with your loved ones at this time.

### "will definitely fly Breeze Air again"
Not Verified | I usually don’t write reviews but because of all the negative reviews for Breeze Airlines, I had to write one. I was very skeptical because of all the bad reviews but a non stop flight is what I wanted and was willing to take the chance. Glad I did. No issues what so ever. Flight was on time, plane was clean. The only negative thing I can think of: I flew regular class, which you only got free water. Had to purchase snacks and drinks. Not a huge deal. Also, there was only 1 flight to choose from. I will definitely fly Breeze Air again.

### "definitely get what you pay for"
Not Verified | I booked a round trip flight with Breeze. The morning of my flight, I woke up to multiple emails saying my flight had been delayed 4 hours. I didn't rush to get ready, due to the extra time I had. I was an hour away from the airport and about an hour and a half before my flight I received another message saying my flight was leaving on time. I scheduled my Uber and went to the airport. I tried to check in through the app but was told I couldn't and would need to check in at the counter. Everything I could find on the Breeze app told me to go to Terminal B. My Uber driver said Breeze was normally Terminal A buy took me to B at my request. I got there and found out I did need to walk to Terminal A which was very long with my luggage. When I arrived, they told me I was 15 minutes too early to check in. I waited, checked in and got my boarding pass with no issue but they weren't very friendly. Once I made it to the gate, we were supposed to depart at 4:50. We didn't start boarding until 4:50 and were never given a reason for the delay. When we started boarding, it wasn't the plane we booked. It was much smaller, no first class or extra leg room seating. We just sat wherever we could. The pilot finally came on and told us our plane had been damaged by the ground crew. To apologize, they gave everyone free drinks and snacks. When we landed in Tulsa, we sat at the gate for 20 minutes before being told it was broken and we were moving to a different gate. During my trip, I wanted to add another ticket to my return flight. The ticket was for a child so the app wouldn't let me but it on its own. There is no customer service so I followed the FAQs. It told me how to add a child ticket and I tried to follow the step by step directions but the app didn't do what the FAQs said it would do. Facebook messenger customer service finally told me that I needed to cancel my flight and rebook them together. My ticket don't, not the child's, would double in price. All in all they got me to my destination alive but you definitely get what you pay for.

### "This airline is a nightmare"
This airline is a nightmare. They advertise to be “Tech first” leading with technology. This means no person on the other end of the phone - actually there is NO ONE for customers to call. They actually give you a number to text that NO ONE responds to. And yes, it was the correct number. It prompted me to respond ‘Help’ for assistance. I responded help 6 different times over 4 hours with no response at all. This prompted me to arrive at the airport early. The desk attendant proceeded to tell me that they get priority response which is why I didn’t get a response. So unless you’re already at the airport, forget about getting any assistance. They had a scheduling conflict and delayed my first flight leg to Virginia which would have caused me to miss my connecting Breeze flight on the second leg. I had less than 12hrs notice, and when I got to the airport they refused to hold the connecting flight, said they couldn’t get me on another flight or route that day, and refused to get me on another airline. In fact, they suggested i go to Virginia and get a refund for the rest of the flight. Guess I’m just going to stay in Virginia? Absolutely useless, Incompetent and free of responsibility for messing up your trip. I’m fact, they left me no choice but to cancel my flight and rebook myself with another airline at a loss of hundreds of dollars. They said because I ‘canceled’ I wouldn’t receive any extra points for the inconvenience when they’re the ones that caused this whole situation. I’m never been so displeased with an airline and will never fly with them again or recommend them. Especially if you are planning to be somewhere important. Aside from that, their “tech first” website makes it very difficult to navigate the website if you’re looking for help.

### "absolutely no customer service"
They have absolutely no customer service and the people they do have at the airports are just awful. Particularly at Hartford. Too busy in their phones to wait on people. I hade a 2 1/2 hr direct flight. I paid for premium so I could check 2 bags. Got to the airport 2 hours early. When I landed. No bags? 2 days later they don’t know where they are as they dont track bags. I will NEVER fly them again. You get what you pay for.

### "not worth the aggravation"
I was scheduled to fly Breeze on May 30. I tried several times to look at my reservation and also to check in on the day of my flight. Each time I tried to do this I was given an error message that the flight could not be booked. My flight was booked, I had a confirmation, and I used the booking confirmation I was given. I attempted to reach customer service, be advised they do not have a customer service number. I was referred to FB messenger. I tried that; it took forever for someone to get back to me. By that time, I decided to cut my losses and reserve a flight with another airline. Cheap flights are not worth the aggravation I had trying to confirm my flight, check in or cancel. Think carefully before you fly with Breeze.

### "enjoyed our flight home"
Not Verified |  Really enjoyed our flight home from Charleston to Rhode island aboard Breeze. check in was easy on the phone app. walk up to the desk, showed boarding pass, and attendant printed luggage tags. flight was on time, seats are preselected so no worries about getting split up or sitting somewhere you didnt want to. The A220 is a very comfortable plane.

### "Worst Airline Experience"
Not Verified |  Worst Airline Experience in 10 Years. We booked a Round Trip flight from RIC to CHS. Could not check in on-line, even with a Confirmation and all relevant information. Had to go to the desk to print a boarding pass. Flight to CHS was relatively smooth. No major complaints. But this AM, trying to return, same problem. Cannot checkin on line - tried a dozen times starting yesterday within the 24 hour window specified by the website. Get to the airport, wait in line at Breeze counter for 35 mins - get to the desk and am told that they can't print my boarding pass because the flight leaves within 45 mins. Yes, 44 mins. Nope, no Boarding Pass. Sorry, you're out of luck. I spend another $300 for a flight on a different "real" airline for later the same day, get my boarding pass within minutes, online, mind you and get thru TSA. I march to the Breeze counter where I'm actually told that I don't need a Boarding Pass. They told me I don't need a Boarding Pass to get thru Security / TSA screening. Since when? And, and if that's the case, wouldn't it have been really helpful for someone at the Check In Desk to mention that to me when it would have mattered instead of saying "Sorry, we can't do anything - like print your boarding pass for you". I found this experience to be one of if not the most infuriating travel experiences in a lifetime (25 years) of mostly decent treatment by airlines, hotels and travel companies. Breeze is worse than any other discount airline you can think of. This will be my one and only Breeze interaction and I Still can't believe that TSA will let anyone in Charleston thru with just a Driver's License. If that's true, I'd suggest not flying out of CHS since apparently, anyone can get to the gates now as long as they have an ID.

### "First time trying this airline"
First time trying this airline out from Orlando to Santa Ana California. The Flight was scheduled at 11:30am 05/25/2023. Woke up and saw a txt message from Airline that it’ll be delayed until 12:45pm. Left the house at 9:30, another txt message that it’ll be delayed till 2:30pm. Around 10:30am, one more txt that it will delayed until 4:30pm and it will be on Embraer 190 which will have to land in Tucson for Refuel. From Orlando to Tucson, the AC on the airplane purposely turned off. Everyone feeling like being baked in the oven. It was so hot. After awhile waiting at Tucson for refueled under that hot conditions, Airplane flew awhile and I could feel the AC for a while, Someone has to pay me a lot to go on this MCO to SNA again.

### "they started bumping people"
First, the positive. The flight crew is extremely nice and apologetic about the situation. I booked a 1st class ticket at a great price round trip from John Wayne to Orlando. Both ways, they "downgraded" the aircraft and delayed the flight over 3 hours on the outbound and 6 hours on the inbound. The flight went from a non-stop to a refueling stop in Tulsa. Because of the downgrade the flight was then overbooked and they started bumping people. Sparing you the gory details, Do not fly this airline if you want to get to your destination.

### "seat was no longer available"
Not Verified | I booked flights for my son, his wife and their 3 year old daughter and 2 month old son. I booked them first class and paid for the upgrade to first. My son and granddaughter were in row 3 side by side and my daughter in law and 2 month old grandson were in row 4 side by side. I went online today to check their flights and discovered my daughter in law had been moved to ROW 20 and my 2 month old grandson was seated alone. After 5 hours of trying to contact the airline I received a text message. I was told Breeze changed planes and her seat was no longer available. Apparently BREEZE felt ok with abandoning a 2 month old to be seated alone. After hours of texting they told me they can move the 2 month old with his mother to ROW 16. Now the family is no longer seated together. BREEZE tried to give me points for this inconvenience to which I said no thank you. Will never fly BREEZE again. I had no choice but to move my daughter in law and grandson to ROW 16. This airline is a gaff. Any airline that would abandon an infant should not be allowed to operate. Clearly the reservation was for an infant and his car seat. Clearly BREEZE moved his mother and gave someone else her seat abandoning him.

### "they won't help you if you need support"
Warning: If you are shopping around for flights and Breeze shows up on the list, keep looking! My dad's flight was supposed to leave at 3.40, and it was delayed around 10 times. It was tough to keep up because each time they sent an email, they would send another email. The flight finally left at 11.54 last night. They do not have customer service, meaning you can't just call a number to get support. This airline is an absolute nightmare. We ended up buying another flight to ensure that he was able to get home. We lost all trust that this company would actually take off from the ground after so many delays. We will never fly with them again. Don't let the lower airfare sway you. There's a reason it's cheaper. They won't leave on time, and they won't help you if you need support.

### "No customer service"
Not Verified | The worst airline I have ever encountered. Lost our baggage and will not pay us for the items. No customer service, no email. No phone number. You must text and it takes days to get a response, if you ever get a response.

### "Terrible experience"
Not Verified |  
Terrible experience. 2 last minute changes. My son had a straight flight, no stops that was switched to a flight with a stop/layover. We weren't even notified, I just happened to check his flight info the day before. The morning of the flight we were notified last minute that it was delayed 2 hrs. Then when he finally boarded, they were delayed again because a flight attendant called out. My son should be almost halfway home by now but he hasn't even left yet. If you have to fly more than 2 hrs I wouldn't go with Breeze. The app really sucks, kept telling me the only person who could make changes is the person that booked it. I booked it and wasn't able to change anything

### "The staff was friendly"
Not Verified |  Pleasantly surprised at how nice our trip was on Breeze Airways. The plane seemed newer than other planes we had been on. The staff was friendly. The flight was smooth with no delays. We will be flying with them again.

### "Horrible customer experience"
Not Verified |  Breeze cancelled by flight the night before I was to come home. Next earliest available flight was 3 days later forcing me to book a different airline, of course more expensive since short notice. They should have covered that flight, but did not. My refund was partial, and rest in Breeze points. Went back and forth with them and was notified I should have bought flight insurance. Horrible customer experience. I need to buy flight insurance to handle Breeze just deciding to cancel their flight?

### "First and last time flying this airline"
First and last time flying this airline. Booked an early flight so we could spend the weekend in California. Woke up at 4 am for my flight to find out that at 11 pm they've sent an email that the flight departure time us delayed by an hour. Got to the airport and was informed that the flight is going to be late by another hour. Should have booked with more reliable airline. This one is a joke.

### "Changed the date of my flight"
Changed the date of my flight without even asking or warning me. There's no way to add luggage. It keeps telling me it's not possible nobody talks to you. The email people are rude. The text people are rude. I'm inconvenienced I have to take a day off of work. I have to find a way to the airport now because my friend that was taking me to the airport can't take me and I can't just cancel my flight as my daughter's having surgery and I have to be in South Carolina. I will never use this airline ever again nor will I go through Priceline you both are useless and it's against the law for you to change my itinerary without my permission or being compensated for it.

### "awful lack of communication"
Our 5pm flight was delayed due to mechanical issues. For a couple of hours, the captain gave somewhat frequent updates that a spare plane was coming but delayed due to weather. All understandable. 3-4 hours later, we get a final update that the spare plane had launched and the crew was “going to get some food” in the meantime, then they all left with their luggage. At 9.30pm, we get an email that the flight is delayed until the next day. The lone service rep at the desk would either tell you to “check the app/emails” or just walk away. They refused to communicate anything over the loudspeaker, so fellow passengers were having to yell out updates to each other about new flight times, where to find luggage, etc. We will never fly Breeze again due to this awful lack of communication while leaving us stranded and scrambling 6 hours after our flight time.

### "First class was amazing"
First class was amazing. Plane was comfy and clean. It was only $130 total with no extra fees. Included a carry on, checked bag, zone 1 boarding, food and alcohol for free during the flight. I would definitely do it again for the price

### "not ever fly Breeze again"
Not Verified |  We have not flown with Breeze before, but was the only option as this was the only direct flight to final destination. With that being said, we will not ever fly Breeze again. My husband booked a trip from Cincinnati to California for a golf trip. Breeze looses my husbands golf clubs and leaves him on “standby” not giving him any additional information on where his luggage/clubs are. Five days into the trip and he still does not have his clubs. Breeze then told him to drive to the nearest (which was two hours away from where he was staying) to pick up his clubs. He arrives at said airport, and they still do not have the clubs. Breeze told him the clubs were not on that flight. They offered to refund him $45 when he was charged over $120 to ship the oversize luggage to his destination. He was still charged $120 for the oversize luggage, but still has not received it. Not only is my husband out the clubs, but has no update on them, and is having to rent clubs daily and bought new golf shoes to accommodate breeze airlines mess up for his trip. This is the worst service we’ve ever received! Lack of empathy and communication does not help the situation.

### "not my preferred seating"
Paid for preferred seating, and they placed us by the toilets, and that was not my preferred seating. When requested a refund, the support chat was very rude, and the in-flight entertainment as advertised was never available on either flights.

### "flight times are also convenient"
Breeze specializes in flights out of secondary markets, like my home airport of Richmond. I would probably fly them just for the direct flights to the west; being able to go directly to Arizona without needing to connect is a gamechanger. The flight times are also convenient as well - unlike JetBlue, which showed its disdain for Richmond by scheduling its (since canceled) flight from Richmond to LA at 9 PM, Breeze schedules its west coast flights so that they leave east coast mid-morning and get back before it's too late at night. But what I really like is that upgrading to their Nicest cabin with a first class seat is very reasonable - maybe $100 each way. The ability to fly nonstop and in comfort makes Breeze a winning proposition. There are some things they could do better - there's no wifi or IFE on the plane, and the flights only run twice a week, so it's not always possible to use Breeze if your schedule doesn't match up. But I hope these are growing pains that they will resolve as they continue to grow and become more successful.

### "Horrible airline"
Horrible airline! Absolutely avoid! I upgraded my ticket to first class because I was checking two bags and the difference between the bag costs and first class for a four hour flight just made sense. Well, I got to the counter and was charged for both bags (additional $100). I was shown a jenky post it to take a picture with a phone number that only offers the option of texting. When you text, you get a response that there's a long wait time for a response. Well, I received a curt response stating that because my initial ticket was not first class (it was an upgrade) that my bags are not included. No apologies - just took bad, so sad. To really rub salt in the wound, we are delayed one hour. This flight on Breeze is my first and last. Absolutely one star customer service to match this one star airline.

### "This is a terrific airline"
Not Verified |  This is a terrific airline! The low, low price had me wondering but I had a fantastic experience I have flown on many airlines both nationally and inter nationally and this was great!. The check in was fast and the people very friendly. The seats had more leg room than I have had in many years. The under the seat storage was also very roomie probably due to the fact that there are only 2 seats on a side rather than the usual 3 seats wedged in the space. The flight was direct which only took 1 hour and 11 minutes to Long Island, N.Y. rather than the 3-4 hours on other airlines. I paid the small fee to check a large bag and it was worth it. The luggage came out fast after my flight. It's no frills so you have no free drinks or food but come on, for an hour flight at these prices I can do without even though they did sell food and drinks .I would very happily fly Breeze anywhere it goes and will recommend this great airline to everyone.

### "Disorganized, terrible customer service"
Disorganized, terrible customer service when something goes wrong. I booked two one way flights with this airline since the routes were direct. I upgraded to First Class. The first flight on the way there was a good experience with the exception of an initial delay that was less than 1 hour. The seat in first class was comfortable and service on the flight was good. Things fell apart on the return flight. The flight was delayed three times. The gate was switched to the other end of the airport on the last delay. Issues occurred at the airport where the flight was removed from the status board for some reason. However, the Breeze app listed the new gate but upon arrival to the gate there were no agents in uniform and the gate was advertised for a completely different airline. After 15 min of searching for either a Breeze representative (there were none) or someone working for the airport, the flight was missed. Once I finally found a Breeze representative they offered no realistic solutions. The Breeze agent claimed to have no responsibility for the monitor at the gate advertising a completely different flight with a different airline. I was offered to be booked on a flight several days later to a different destination city that was more than a 6 hour drive from my original booking destination. I was forced to book a new one way ticket from the airport costing close to $500.00 just to get home. Breeze has made no offerings and seems to accept zero responsibility. I highly encourage you to not book with this airline because if something happens good luck getting to your destination or back home. I have always been a huge Delta fan and would highly suggest sticking with a larger commercial airline where they value customer service and will take care to get you to your destination.

### "Not worth the cheap seats"
Not Verified | Skip it. 4 Flight delays to depart. Followed by a grounding for maintenance. Delay forced us to book a hotel and not make it to our family at any kind of reasonable time. NOT looking forward to the return flight next week, but I will update you. Not worth the "cheap seats". Fly Frontier or Southwest!

### "said we would be reimbursed"
Not Verified |  Two nights before our flight out I received an email saying they were looking for 16 volunteers to cancel their trips because they had booked more guests then seats available on the plane. A night later i received another email saying they still was looking for 11 people to cancel. Shortly after our flight got delayed 5 hours. Then delayed another 2 hours but they didn’t tell us about the second delayed. We got to the airport and every few minutes they told us it would be longer. They took forever to board then plane and we were ridiculously late to where we needed to be. Flying home we got to the airport for a 7:30 flight which we didn’t even board until after 8am. The plane was small and uncomfortable. We will never ever use breeze again. So much better off spending money and having a reliable and comfortable flight. Safe to say we hated this airline. Also it is absolutely impossible to contact anyone working for breeze. Also said we would be reimbursed for our over 7 hour delay but that never happened either.

### "This was a terrible experience"
This was a terrible experience. Flight delays with no explanation. Then they took my bag off the plane at the stop when we didn’t even get off the plane. I was told via text it was an accident and they do not provide and assistance except refunding my checked bag fee. They would not forward my bag earlier instead they’re waiting for the next flight which is not until Friday. So there is no way of knowing if I’ll ever get my stuff. Worst customer service experience ever. They literally don’t even have a person you can talk to and the text service is clearly not going to resolve anything.

### "Overall, the staff was fantastic"
I was initially concerned after I booked my tickets due to the reviews. This is my experience flying direct from Tampa to Norfolk and then Norfolk to Tampa a week later. I fly first thing in the morning and sat in the Nicer seats. Overall, no issues with the flight. The boarding process was very easy and go the seat with no problem. If you are a bigger person, you may need a seat belt extender. Just ask the flight crew right when you step on and they will give you one before heading to the seat. Once boarded the captain came out and spoke with the cabin and explained the flight. We took off on time and landed 20 minutes early. The fight was very smooth and couldn't have been happier. There are inflight refreshments but unless you are in the Nicest seats cost money. I flew back to Tampa in the Nicest seats and WOW! what an upgrade. For an extra fifty bucks having the extra width and leg room was fantastic. I sat in row 1 which provide extra leg room and at 6'4'' was more room then really needed. The seats are comfortable and have a reclining feature with a foot/ leg rest. Inflight refreshments come with the seat which include a can of soda and other beverages and snacks. The snacks are not the little airplane snacks but large bags of chips, candy, and energy bars. Overall, the staff was fantastic. The inflight stewards were professional and very nice and accommodating. The gate staff were also professional and prompt to load flights and get people on. The only things to remember: No in free inflight refreshments. Depending on your seat you will be allowed a personal item, carry on, or loaded bag. Some seats only allow a small personal item, and a carry-on bag will cost extra. Also I think the reviews related to delay flight and issues relate to a very limited number of aircraft. I was the only Breeze flight at the terminal, of the flight was cancelled there would be no other alternative, so there is a inherent risk you are taking. They do not have the plane inventory like Delta or AA and can accommodate a change. Also they fly on certain days and times from the airports. When scheduling makes sure to schedule a flight that has another flight the next day just in case there is a issue.

### "This airline is miserable"
Not Verified |  This airline is miserable, stranded people for 26 hours, will reimburse $125 hotel, good luck finding a hotel that cheap on a moments notice, no cab or food reimbursement. Worst airline experience ever and sadly this was your first impression.

### "seem to cancel quite regularly"
Not Verified |  They canceled flight at midnight the morning of our return flight. Gave us only 12 hours to find another flight. Discovered this at 4 AM as we were sleeping when we got notified. Reason they gave is could not get staff. Not dependable. Flight down took off 90 minutes late. What good is a cheap price if you make plans based on their schedule and they don’t seem to care to honor them as they seem to cancel quite regularly if not a full flight.

### "It's not worth the cheaper airfare!"
Not Verified |  I had a short trip planned for just me and my daughter to go to Disneyland for her birthday. I booked our flights months ago and made plans with friends we were meeting there. We planned 3 days at the parks and lunch and mani/pedi's on the first day. However Breeze Airways changed our flight coming home from 10pm to 11.50am and then changed it again to 2.30pm in the course of the few weeks leading up to our trip. This made it so we had to cancel our third day at Disneyland because we no longer had a full last day. Now it is the day before we leave and I was just notified that our outgoing flight tomorrow has been delayed 5 hours! Now we will miss lunch and our apt for manicures and pedicures tomorrow. When you have such a short trip planned it is incredibly frustrating when the airlines basically take an entire day off your trip and you have to cancel plans. And to make it worse they don't have a phone number you can call to make changes to your flights. It is all electronic and very frustrating trying to navigate making changes, having questions answered and nobody to even make a complaint to! I will never fly Breeze again and I don't recommend them to anyone. It's not worth the cheaper airfare!

### "Avoid at all costs"
Not Verified |  This will be the first and last experience with this atrocious airline. Avoid at all costs. Somehow, who would have guessed an airline even worse than Spirit could pop up. I have never seen such nonexistent customer service and horrible treatment of passengers in my entire life flying several times a year on various airlines. To be completely uninformed for hours and have the flight constantly delayed, only to be canceled out of nowhere causing us to lose our entire trip. On top of that, the rude agents at the desk saying "we cannot rebook anyone" after abruptly canceling the flight with no issues to the aircraft. Please be wary of the low cost, it is that way for a reason.

### "stuck in Las Vegas for 12 Hours"
Not Verified | My son and his team are scheduled to compete in Anaheim today. The team from their HS are booked on an Orlando flight to LAX and because of cloud cover whatever reason, the plane cannot land were re routed to Las Vegas! We’re talking of a team of 25 kids and why Las Vegas? Is John Wayne, Ontario, Burbank not available. The team with their chaperones were stuck in Las Vegas for 12 Hours! No one could help them. The students missed their scheduled competition.

### "Can’t say I’m flying Breeze again"
Not Verified |  To start, I went to the podium before the flight to see if I could get priority boarding because I’m on crutches with a broken leg and they denied it. They changed airports on us from SNA to LAX after I specifically planned this trip around avoiding LAX because of my broken leg. Breeze is labelled as terminal 1 but once you’re in the terminal there’s no direction to actually get to your gate (my app and boarding pass said TBD for the gate far after I talked to people to figure it out). Let me give you a hint, you have to walk a ways to find a tram that takes you to another gate. You should talk to someone because there’s no labelling. Flight was delayed two hours to depart at 10 instead of 8. I’m not mad about that part. Everyone was at the gate waiting and about 10 minutes after boarding was suppose to start they said the flight was delayed for another two hours. Four hours total! We weren’t given any reason and one person said this was unacceptable so they said over the intercom they’d call law enforcement to the gate if needed. Grow up. Can’t say I’m flying Breeze again, very unprofessional. Just cancel the flight so I can go home and get some rest.

### "smallest seats that I have ever flown in"
Not Verified |  No frills, no customer service, no wifi, no inflight entertainment no free beverage or free snack. This is a case of you get what you pay for. The basic rates are very attractive, but you need to pay extra to book the seat & check a bag. As far as the seats, the economy seats are the smallest seats that I have ever flown in. If you are tall, you will be uncomfortable, get the upgraded seats there is a big difference! Bring your own beverage and snack unless you want to pay for them on board. Our flight time got postponed 3x in one day until it got cancelled at 8:00 pm. (Related to thunderstorms along the route) It was rescheduled for the next morning for 7:15 then moved to 8:30 by the time we got off the ground it was 9:20 am. Airline offered a $125 hotel credit, which of course there is not a hotel near any airport that cost $125/nite! Our return flight was right on time as scheduled. On a positive note the staff was very friendly. -bring your own drink/snack, download your music, podcast or movie before you get on the plane. Otherwise, you will have to read an old fashioned book.

### "not recommend flying with them"
I would not recommend flying with them. They charged me for 2 checked bags both ways and refused a refund or do to anything to fixed the situation. The have no customer service number only text and then refused to reply. Complete awful service.

### "Do not recommend"
If less than 1 star was an option I would give it. We were delayed for well over 4 hours with no communication. The agents at the airport had no idea there was a delay, the passengers had to tell them. The delay started with an hour, kept ticking up, which happens, but the staff was incredibly unhelpful. The gate agent talked on her phone the entire time while a line formed at the counter. Finally after 15 minutes of her talking on the phone, someone asked if she could provide an update, she was rude and said she had no idea if we would go or not and could not provide any information. The reason this airline is so cheap is because you will likely get stuck where you are and there will be no communication. Do not recommend.

### "be using Breeze in the future"
Breeze turned out to be a great airline. Staff was great, plane was clean and very nice, seats were roomy. Plane was on time going and just about 20 minutes late leaving Las Vegas . All of our luggage went to a different airport in Florida but they were in contact with us before we reached the terminal and stayed in contact until they had it delivered to our house by the next day. I will definitely be using Breeze in the future!

### "Terrible airline"
Not Verified |  Terrible airline! Flight (Provo to Phoenix) was cancelled after hours of delays despite personal assurances by the Breeze representative at the airport that the pilot would not time out--that's exactly what happened. Was not notified of the cancellation until 20 minutes before the delayed flight was to land, but they had to know hours before that by doing some simple math. Their late notification of cancellation left us without options to fly that day. Can not contact customer support by phone, only text or email, which received a very delayed answer (for the email it was the next day). I understand unexpected delays or cancellations, but the lack of effort to provide transparency or options to customers is just poor business. Never fly Breeze!

### "Employees were unknowledgeable"
Not Verified |  Breeze makes Spirit first class. This was the most generic, torture trip I have ever experienced. If my client hadn't booked I would have been off the plane before it took off. Bare bones is putting it nicely. Employees were unknowledgeable, no one could answer why we were weather delayed after loading despite the weather being clear across the country. Not worth the cheap price if they can't get you there on time, lie about it and you have no WiFi or entertainment in an uncomfortable seat.

### "do not fly with them"
I flew with them from New Orleans to White Plains with a stop in Jacksonville. Once we got to Jacksonville due to weather in White Plains we started out delayed so what did Breeze do they made us deboard the plane rebooked me a flight back to New Orleans from Jacksonville that left for New Orleans 6 hrs later. I had to book a flight out of New Orleans the next on another airline costing me another 684 dollars. They never contacted me to say hey we have a flight leaving the next if you want it. Nothing. Then they turn and had the nerve to ask me if I wanted a credit for the flight and sorry for your loss. I choose to have the 94 dollars cause that all they would give back for all the money I spent. I don’t need the credit cause I will never fly with them again. Oh and this is the second time this has happened to me, the first time I took the credit cause the poor lady at the gate was so nice. Breeze has cost me so much money for the 2 times I have tried to use them. You are better off booking a flight with someone else. Cheap isn’t always good, do not fly with them.

### "Breeze isn’t helping at all"
Our flight from Phoenix back home to CT, was delayed several times throughout the course of this afternoon. Breeze just canceled our flight “due to weather”. We are know there is no weather anywhere where our flight is going or where it’s been. There is no way to get home on the airline for at least 3 days, and they won’t fly us home on another airline. We are now stranded on the other side of the country and Breeze isn’t helping at all.

### "I would never recommend this airline"
Not Verified |  Our flight was really disappointing. Furthermore, our flight got cancelled due to weather conditions, but this experience with Breeze was tremendously irritating. First of all, our flight kept getting delayed numerous of times in which making us get home much more later than usual. We needed to get home to our animals, and we need to go back home to get to school and work. In addition, they kept offering us flights that wouldn’t get home until Monday in which we needed to get home immediately. Further, we had to waste all of our time booking a flight on a better and different airline when we could have been sitting on the airplane flying home and relaxing. When we got downstairs to get our bags, the staff just threw our luggage onto the carousel without us knowing which really annoyed myself and others. The contacting was terrible, and we kept messaging asking Breeze for a refund when they would reply, but it took them a long time too. Finally, we had to go through a lot with our flight being canceled by booking a flight on a different airline in charging us more money, buying an Uber, and making this flight experience way more stressful than it could have been. In conclusion, I would never recommend this airline, Breeze, because the experience is terribly disappointing.

### "Refused to reimburse for hotel night"
Not Verified |  Flight was delayed 3 hours leaving HSV. Flight back from Vegas was cancelled, but the airline posted delays one hour at a time all day, then too late to get another price. Refused to reimburse me for the extra hotel night I had to pay for, plus 2 meals. Arrived home over 24 hours later than I was supposed to. Flight crew was excellent and they gave us all a snack box. Really nice plane. I am going to give them ONE more try.

### "major staffing problems"
Not Verified | This airline started out well but no longer seems to have their act together. Seems they are having major staffing problems along with an aging fleet.

### "experienced significant problems"
Not Verified |  On our flight with Breeze recently we experienced significant problems. First, the toilets were unusable. This made for a very uncomfortable end to the trip. Next they lost our luggage for 14 days and we had to spend considerable time and money to get our luggage back. They didn't reimburse us for our costs although they lied and said that they would. Breeze caused us inconvenience, stress, and unnecessary expenses. Breeze promised to ship our luggage. They reneged on that. Then Breeze promised to pay for our costs to pick up the bag ourselves from the airport and they reneged on that too. Breeze also promised to pay for essential items (toiletries etc) that were delayed in our luggage and that we had to purchase ourselves. They reneged on that too. I find Breeze to be a very insincere, untrustworthy and dishonest company.

### "Excuse of an airline"
Not Verified |  Most uncomfortable seats, which barely lean back. Bare minimum everything - no wifi, no inflight entertainment. Everything costs something (soda, snacks, etc). They cancelled flights less than a month out because they changed their routes and neglected to alert anyone to this effect. Excuse of an airline.

### "Not happy that I can't get a refund or a credit"
Flying out of Las Vegas to Richmond, the plane was at the gate, and because of wind in Richmond, they decided last minute to cancel our flight. The service desk stated they would be unable to help with refunds / rebooking. I attempted to refund via the app but conveniently , the app is unable to process my request for a refund. There is no live agent to talk with for this airline and sending emails seems to only going into the abyss. I had to spend 1500.00 with another airline to book a flight out of Las Vegas for the next day so i would be able to fly home. Not happy that I can't get a refund or a credit even if i tried.

### "This airline is a joke"
This airline is a joke. They are ill-equipped to deal with weather. My flight was delayed 2x and then canceled in a text as I was heading to the airport. No customer service, the first available flight was 20 days later. Leaving me stranded, I had to book a flight on a different airline at a ridiculously expensive price. Breeze offered no reimbursement, no voucher, no alternative flight. As the saying goes, you get what you pay for and in this case you get nothing.

### "chaos ran supreme in our experience"
We decided to give Breeze a shot; the savings were great and I doubted it could be that bad. I was wrong. Their operations seem to be nonexistent and chaos ran supreme in our experience. Approximately five hours before departure on our return flight they informed us our flight was delayed and moved to a completely different airport, which took an extra two hours to get to. I had to spend the remainder of our trip figuring out what our options were. Their communication is awful: by 8pm I figured out that the plane slotted for our new "9:40pm departure" was still in the air and over 2 hours away from the new airport, but the app still said the status was "on time" for 9:40pm departure. It still showed as "on time at 9:30, when I stopped checking. There was no one at the airport from Breeze who could help, the app doesn't work as stated, their mobile website doesn't work as stated to make changes, and support was unreachable in this situation. I finally threw in the towel and booked a hotel for the night and a one-way ticket to return home return on Delta. I looked and the flight finally departed at 12:15am. On our outgoing flight we had major issues with bag check, ticketing, delayed departure, and they were understaffed and completely lost/flustered at the desks. The flight itself was fine until we landed - I have done a fair amount of flying, and I have never had that hard of a landing. It was unnerving how hard we landed.

### "Very unprofessional"
I was on the phone 3 times trying to change my flight and was hung up on each time when I asked them to repeat what they said cause I couldn’t hear/understand exactly what they were asking for. Each time I call no one apologizes for me being hung up on and now I’m stuck across the United States because every airline is $1400 to fly back to Richmond for two people. Very unprofessional and not helpful at all. If you have an issue might as well keep it to yourself because they won’t help you for shit.

### "they’re doing something right"
I was elated to see Breeze flying nonstop to Hartford from RDU — I would no longer have to connect through a major hub to get there. (And it was cheaper than when I flew SWA there last year.) The 2x weekly schedule is hard to schedule a trip around but since I was going to ‘90s Con the dates worked out. The check in crew is friendly enough and the flight attendants ok. (And for people who bought the Nicer tier should get a free snack and a drink BTW, not just a cup of water.) The seating in the Embraer aircraft, even in the Nicer section is tight like an AA regional jet. (Economy seating on a Delta mainline is roomier!) I got to my destination and back home safe and reasonably on time. Breeze could use some improvement but they’re doing something right because inbound to BDL was almost full and outbound to RDU was completely full.

### "Seats comfortable. Staff friendly"
I was skeptical of this airlines because of how new it was and seemed to be getting so-so reviews. So after taking my flight I felt the need to leave a review to help add another viewpoint to the system. Overall I would rate the experience 4.8 out of 5 stars, but have no problem giving them 5. I flew myself and my family, a total of 3 people, from Orlando, FL to our state home, non-stop, for under $450. This was in the start of spring break for many places and most tickets were 300-$400/person for other flights. Prices for Breeze did go up as the flight day came closer, but stayed under $150/person by the day of the flight. Any other airlines would have been significantly more expensive and had a connection flight, taking longer to get us home. The process on the app is fairly simple and making changes is easy as well. The first issue I had was the app can be a bit slow to update your gate location if it doesn’t have one yet. On the day of the flight we figured out what gate we needed to go to through google flights before the app informed us of the location. It did tell us well in advance though, about an hour out from boarding. It was fairly simple to find the main desks at the airport, but usually no one will be there until at least 2 hours prior to the flight, or at least that’s the case at MCO. Our flight was slightly delayed l, but that was because something delayed it before it arrived in Orlando, so it was just the domino effect. They did do their best to get things caught up, which only had us delayed by 10 min in the end. Boarding went fairly quick and we were quick to get up in the air. One of the captains actually grabbed the intercom that the flight attendants use and updated everyone on the status of everything while in plain view, before departing. I appreciated that personalized address, instead of the standard, locked in the cabin and talking to you from behind closed doors. During the flight, like most budget airlines, every snack and item will cost something. One surprise though is that entertainment is complimentary on our flight, but you’ll have to use your own device. You simply log in to their onboard Wi-Fi and select the “free” option which takes you to their website that offers a variety of movies, shows, and games at no charge. If you want more internet access options you’ll have to pay for upgraded internet. The seats were actually very comfortable for a budget flight. I upgraded us to extra leg room, or basically the first class seats for $30/seat. The seats just behind those though also looked similarly comfortable, but I did not look at the seats further back and don’t know if they’re the same or different the further back you go. Landing went smoothly and my checked baggage was delivered to baggage claim fairly quickly and didn’t have the appearance of being thrown in the ring with a wild bull, like some I’ve seen in the past with other airlines. In the end, I spent a total of $440 and that included 3 selected seats at $30/ea and one checked bag for $35. Flight for 3 people was about $169 and fees were around $146. Overall, I was happy with the airlines and will very likely use them again. Hopefully the experience will continue to be the same. Pros: App easy to navigate and change items with you flight Prices were great Upgrade options were fairly priced Seats were comfortable Staff friendly and captain was personable Cons: App can be slow to update info

### "recommend Breeze to all my East Coast friends"
Not Verified |  I flew twice on Breeze from San Francisco to Richmond in 2021 & 2022 with no delays! At 79 years old, I was thrilled  to finally fly direct to Richmond! Less than 7 hours each time. The plane was new, the leg space very nice (I’m 5’ 7’ & could lose a little weight) & at that time few amenities! I’m planning another trip in April. I recommend Breeze to all my East Coast friends.

### "worst airline I have ever used"
This is by far the worst airline I have ever used and it is not even close. I have flown this airline for about two years solely because it gets me to where I need to go without a layover. However, I have recently decided that I would rather have a layover than fly with this airline. Not one of my flights over the years has ever been on time (or even close to on time). None of the staff ever knows what is happening and are basically completely useless. The app is God awful. They constantly have problems updating delays, and sometimes even say your flight has been moved up when it has in fact been delayed further. The communication has become increasingly poor, and they no longer send any texts or emails to indicate delays or cancellations. You know and airline sucks when they start having to refund you in airline points instead of money. Do not fly this airline.

### "I will never take Breeze again"
My flight from RIC to SFO has been delayed 4 1/2 hours. This is a ridiculously unprofessional situation for this airline. This is my first time flying Breeze. I am a frequent flyer, A-List Preferred with Southwest, and I will never take Breeze again. They are mismanaged, incompetent and a complete waste of time and money

### "Do not use this airline!"
Do not use this airline! They flew me from Provo/Salt Lake to John Wayne/Orange County CA and was supposed to continue onto Orlando then said that the crew did not have the hours to fly us to Orlando (which now that I want reimbursement have said it was due to weather) I had to get an Uber to LAX and fly to Orlando (for my brother’s wedding) on a reputable airline. Then because it wasn’t far enough away to cancel and book with a reputable airline I had to use my return ticket with them (you have to cancel before 2 weeks). I guess I should be glad the didn’t leave me in CA again even though we had to stop there. The flight was almost 12 hours late and to finish the worst airline experience of my life, my golf clubs did not come out. The only breeze employee at the airport took my ticket stub said he would get it put in the computer because he didn’t have access at 3:00am and suggested that if I need my golf clubs before they either find them or reimburse me I could rent some at the coarse. Like I can rent custom clubs! Also, try finding a person to get customer support from Breeze! It’s a joke! I finally got a text answered but we’ll see if jumping through their hoops is going to help.

### "I had a very pleasant experience"
I had a very pleasant experience with Breeze airways. I didn’t have high expectations, as it is a low budget airline. Other than a slight delay in departure, the staff was tremendously friendly and prompt, the plane was clean and modern, and the other passengers were mostly elderly people that followed the rules and kept to themselves. Yes you must pay for drinks or an extra checked bag, but it was still very affordable and totally worth it for me. Granted, I wouldn’t choose to fly this airline long distance, but for a short trip between two good airports, I don’t see an issue with it. In fact, because they are a smaller airline, the lines at the checkin counter and gate are very small, adding an unforeseen bonus. I want to leave this review so that people don’t only see the disgruntled complaints and know that breeze can offer great service as well.

### "this atrocious experience"
I won't give Breeze Airways the chance to do it again. Outbound flight delayed 4 1/2 hours. Return flight delayed 2 hours, which must be the norm for Breeze, since this delay did not meet the threshold for empty apologies from the pilot, as with the first leg of this atrocious experience. Breeze touts itself on its website as the company's "mission is to save you time and money. That’s why you won’t find a call center phone number on this site but you will find plenty of other ways to get answers and reach us quickly and efficiently" In reality, there is no way to reach Breeze "quickly and efficiently". Forget the fact that the majority of passengers on my route were seniors (many who are uncomfortable with the only option to communicate being online, instead of through telephones), the response time from Breeze should be unacceptable to the company which claims its mission is to save time and money for passengers. It took 90 minutes to get a response from Breeze's SMS text center. Worse, the response was created by artificial intelligence, and, it did not address my problem. For the amount of stress that this single trip caused -- not only for me and my travel partner, but for my family who waited to pick me up - and then drop me off at the airport, checking their phones constantly for the latest Breeze updates that were inaccurate. I'd have nobody to blame but myself if I chose to fly this airline again.

### "I will never fly this airline again"
Not Verified |  This is the second time flying this airline and have had nothing but issues first time a day delay and today supposedly the plane can in to fast and needs to be inspected. I will never fly this airline again.

### "not be flying on Breeze ever again"
I frequently fly for business and am currently on a business trip. I flew to Orlando from Salt Lake City on Southwest Airlines and booked with Breeze airlines on my return due to the low cost and direct flight to Arkansas where I also have clients. I paid for the 'Nicer' Ticket which allows for a personal item/carry-on/and checked bag and was seated in their 'extra legroom' section at the front of the plane. While our flight was almost 2 hours late on arrival. There was an electronic issue with the plane that caused difficulty at both gates as the airbridge could not communicate with the plane and added additional time on the plane at each gate. Upon arrival at the baggage claim checked bag customers waited almost an hour for bags. At which point one of the passengers were able to locate a Breeze gate agent and learned that all of our checked bags had been delivered to SNA instead of XNA. The airline didn't even have the courtesy of letting any of us know about the issue. Passengers were informing others of what was going on. No announcement. As we all proceeded to the gate agent we were asked to write our name and email on a scrap piece of paper that the gate agent was literally ripping up for each of us. We were told they would reach out as soon as they knew anything. I was traveling back to Arkansas with friends and we all woke up to emails with a bag claim number and a phone number we could text for updates. The website has no customer service number and you can ONLY contact Breeze via email, text, or Facebook Messenger. I have done ALL 3. While their website reports to have a customer forward/technical customer service team I have been dealing with BOTS all day. I finally received a curt response via Facebook messenger that told me they were aware of the issue and doing their best. When I responded with a request for a status update and how they planned on compensating me for my troubles and having to replace the items in my bag I got no response. After not receiving any response via text message I again asked for a status update and compensation ... no response until this evening when I was contacted by the same person who messaged me on Facebook. I was told there is no compensation other than my baggage fee as I am at my home airport and to be patient they are dealing with 78 misplaced bags. I explained I am NOT at my home airport. I am here to visit clients and have NONE of my clothing or toiletries etc. I was responded to with a pre-typed response telling me they would consider reimbursing reasonable items and a link that i need to send receipts that are fully itemized with store name and date of purchase. If i purchase more items I am going to need to also purchase a larger suitcase to carry the additional items home and pay for my additional luggage. My initial response from Breeze said our bag return would be based on their flight schedule. The next flight from MCO to XNA is Friday. Does that mean I am here all week with none of my items. Needless to say I will not be flying on Breeze ever again. The lack of customer service is beyond ridiculous!

### "been an absolute nightmare"
Not Verified |  This experience has been an absolute nightmare. Flying back from Orlando to Fayetteville, they did not tell anyone that they loaded everyone's luggage on the wrong plane and that it was in California. Once in Fayetteville, everyone with a checked bag waiting at baggage claim for 45 minutes before being told that our luggage was in California. They have no idea when I will get my luggage back due to their "limited flight schedule" and they will not reimburse me for any of the necessities I bought since "I am home so I shouldn't need anything. I will likely be without my luggage for several days and all they were able to give me was a refund for my bag and $25. As if that would even cover 1% of what was in my suitcase. I do not recommend this airline and will never fly with them again.

### "Total nightmare"
Not Verified |  Total nightmare. Flight from Providence to Charleston was "delayed" due to a hydraulic malfunction signal being given to the Aircraft aAfter we were all boarded. Next de-plane for about an hour until we get this fixed we will update you every 15 minutes. 5 hours later, sorry people we could not get it fixed we rescheduled your flight for 10am tomorrow morning. This was at Midnight! So now we have to find Hotel and a way to get back and forth which they say on their website they will reimburse you $125 for your room. They should pay the receipt which was considerably more. They pay you back in "Breeze Points" which means you have to roll the dice again to get your money back at a future date. Very disappointing.

### "This was quite the flight"
Breeze is an interesting new airline with pros and cons. Pros - quick getting on plane and sitting down, a few empty seats, very fast getting luggage back to you Cons - You have to pay extra for any seat you choose. The low cost price they originally show you is a scam. There is no other way to describe it. In addition, my sister purchased an extra leg room seat for $100 more on the same flight. Here's the twist - every single seat was exactly the same. There was no extra legroom. My personal tray table was broken and hung sideways (that was a first for any plane I've been on). There are no complimentary drinks other than water. It also did not help that the last person who got on the plane was clearly drunk. The staff should never have let him on the flight. They were clearly not trained to deal with this situation. He ended up throwing up all over the girl behind us. This was quite the flight.

### "Both flights delayed"
Not Verified | Never ever again. Thought I would save some money, plus it was a rare direct flight. Both flights delayed-still not sure I will get home after a six hour delay. Every Breeze flight on the board here is delayed by 2-6 hours. Only one other airline has a delay or cancellation. Good try, but should be out of business very soon.

### "the worst company ever"
Not Verified |  This is the worst company ever! First flight was delayed from 8:45am to 12:30pm and then to 1:00pm. Returning flight was canceled 15minutes before departure, when everyone was at the gate. They said it was due to weather conditions. Everyone checked online and there was no weather disruption in our route. Then they said it was due to weather conditions in Utah, I guess the airplane was going there after OC, but we bought a direct flight from Orlando to Santa Ana. Still they said they would not cover for any hotel or food expenses or for flights from another company for those who could not wait until the next day. Not only I have to miss a day of work but I also had to stay/sleepover the airport from 5:00pm to 8:45am. The most uncomfortable night ever. You can barely talk to someone, the only way to contact them is through text message but they reply with pre made/general messages and don’t care about their customer at all. You think you’re saving money due to the cheap flights they offer but it actually becomes the most expensive flight! So not worth it!! This is the first and last time I fly with this company.

### "thanks for making that problem my problem"
Not Verified |  Not off to a great start flying out of John Wayne airport. Initial flight was delayed by an hour after the ground crew broke a bolt off the airplane’s taxi vehicle, plane was fine but they had to inspect for damage and it took an hour plus. Flight home was cancelled (although they labeled it as a delay, a 16 hour delay) due to weather conditions. It’s 80 degrees in Florida right now and 70 in Orange County CA, planes not rated to land in those sunny, mild conditions?? We determined the problem was the weather in the plane’s final destination: Utah, and apparently Breeze is not allowed to park the plane overnight in Orange County. So thanks for making that problem my problem and costing me a day of work and the cost of a hotel.

### "Terrible customer service"
Not Verified |  Terrible customer service - non-existent phone line that they "supplement" with chatbots. Good luck using their website. I'm on the way to my airport and they delayed my flight 16 hours without any notification about the delay - the day on my ticket just magically changed. Thank god I checked. Fingers crossed someone will fill out the routes they take once they go under.

### "Terrible customer service"
Terrible customer service. Our Thursday 2/16/2023 evening flight out of Sarasota was cancelled while we were driving to the airport. We had already checked out of our hotel. Received a text to check email. Email indicated we were automatically booked on next day's midday flight. No reason or apology given. For personal reasons Friday's flight didn't work for us so we extended vacation to Sunday night. Even though the plane arrived early, our flight left 30-minutes late. Not a big deal but consideration to the customer's schedule doesn't seem to be a high concern.

### "such poorly trained, incompetent employees"
I don’t usually fly with discount carriers, but I made an exception because they had a direct flight no one else offered. Big mistake. In 35 years of business travel, I’ve never seen an airline with such poorly trained, incompetent employees at every level. And of course, they don’t have a customer service department to rectify problems they have caused. They won’t take calls and if you try and email them, all you’ll get is an automated response. My only consolation is knowing they’ll be out of business soon. Please don’t make the same mistake I did—stay far away from this airline!

### "Not very good"
Not very good. The flights were direct and cheap, however they were both delayed by 45min-over an hour with no explanation. Unsure if the sometimes cheaper price is worth it in the future.

### "they delayed 10 times"
For our roundtrip flight, they delayed 10 times! We were stuck in Florida. Took us 36 hours to get home with all their delays. Monday the 13th 9:55-10:05 delay Friday 7:00 delayed to 10:00 Cancelled to fly Friday Saturday 10:00 delayed to 12:00 12:00 delayed to 1:45 1:45 delayed to 2:30 2:30 delayed to 3:30 3:30 delayed to 4:00 4:21 and still not loaded 4:27 started loading 4:00 delayed to 4:35 Last delay 4:45 This is the extra costs. $250 hotel $100 food $100 dogs boarded $400 lost work wages. Time spent waiting on check ins $850 plus time lost. They want me to submit receipts and will only reimburse for $125.00. Also they gave us $100.00 for future flights. Lol. Will never use that because we won’t be flying with them again. They will not give me $100 in actual funds. This was due to aircraft availability NOT weather. They overbooked flights.

### "This is absolutely unacceptable"
We booked through the app for a flight from Provo Utah on 2/2 to Las Vegas Nevada, and returning on 2/5 back to Provo. I paid extra to select my seats in this flight and bought the tickets. Little did I know, the itinerary I received via email had my flight leaving Provo leaving 2/5, and returning on the same plane back to Provo on 2/5, this wasn’t what I booked! We tried to cancel, they refused to refund our money, and credited us with “Breeze Points” instead. We have been trying to get them to refund our money, but they refuse to do so. We asked them for a phone number to speak to someone but they will only speak to us via Facebook messenger. This is absolutely unacceptable!

### "An hour later we’re still standing here"
Awful. We boarded and waited and waited. Then we had to get off the plane so it could ‘reboot’, which was supposed to be two to three minutes long. An hour later we’re still standing here. Ridiculous.

### "no explanation, and no chance for a refund"
Not Verified |  That they have no phone support should have been a red flag. Booked a round trip ticket - direct non-stop flights. Two days before take-off they change the flight to a layover. At stopover couldn't get a crew for about four hours. Finally get there. First class" is a joke. Seats are better (slightly) than in the back, but nothing special. Still have to pay for drinks! No food of any kind. On return flight is cancelled that morning - no explanation, and no chance for a refund. Next flight was in three days. So now I have bonus points or something like that on an airline I will never fly again and I'm out $700 for a one-way flight I had to buy the same day.

### "refusing to refund my money"
Flight was 8.30 got to airport and changed to 9.15. Didn’t board till much after that. After waiting on the plane for about 20 minutes engines running we hear an announcement from the pilot that they have to do a reset that there’s issues and that the system is overloaded ha ha ha you know how computers are so you have a choice you can get off the plane now or stay on the plane for 20 minutes of darkness. I stayed on the plane. Pilot comes on again and says we are having a problem and we’ve called for the engineers. You need to get off the plane now and we all did. At least four times we received notification to wait another 30 minutes another hour another 40 minutes until eventually it was about midnight. Pilot came out again said over loudspeaker the engineers left and we have now had to call in a mechanic to try to fix the issue. It appears to be with the brake but it’s not really a brake we need but it’s the brake, all the while smiling and laughing. Many people started walking to the ends of the gate area. Everything was shut down everything was dark. It was midnight at this point and one of the stewardesses got over the loudspeaker and said do not go through the gates stay in this confined area, FSA is closed. You won’t get back in. There’s no one at any of the boarding pass. All places for food closed vending machine for drink broken. Approximately 2 AM the pilot comes out again and says the mechanic can’t find the pin the titanium pin that he needs for the brakes. He’s trying to find it and can’t he’s reached out and tried to find other mechanics. there’s no one here so the mechanic has walked off the job and we’re rescheduling your flight. Check your email for all the details. Email clearly says for a full refund from your original payment method fill out this form. My original payment method was my credit card which they switched to breeze box I guess for their convenience I did not ask for this to happen and they are refusing to refund my money. Obviously the safety of their customers is nothing to them. I am a 60 year old woman that is handicapped I walk with a limp. Nobody came to check on me. Nobody asked if I needed assistance and we were left again without water without food without anything and they refuse to refund my ‘original’ payment method my credit card. By the way, the stewardesses never came out to check for us. They were lying on the floor in the tunnel that you walk on to get into the plane the whole time unless they had an announcement.

### "doesn’t care about its customers"
Not Verified |  They canceled our flight from Savannah to White Plains, NY, due to weather. It happens. However, there were no Breeze flights for 4 days, so we had to buy 1-way tickets on another airline, which cost us $700. They refuse to reimburse us for any of this. Not only that, we were actually instructed to buy said tickets by the ticket agent. She said to submit our receipts to Breeze & they would reimburse us - which they now refuse to do. This airline doesn’t care about its customers or its reputation, apparently.

### "the low price tag is a warning"
I flew Breeze because they had the best prices and it didn’t take long to see why - you get what you pay for. First, they rescheduled my flight to one much later in the day- it still worked with my schedule so thankfully it wasn’t an issue. Then, the plane had many issues including many seats being stuck in the recline position, a panel of the ceiling falling off mid-flight and a man’s oxygen mask falling from the ceiling when the plane landed. The final straw which is really what is making me write this review is a baggage issue we had. One of the bags we checked had 2 wheels torn off. We were instructed to go to the Breeze counter at the Charleston, SC airport to report the claim. We went to the counter immediately after getting the bag from baggage claim. They took down our contact information, flight information and also took pictures of the damage on their cell phone. When I asked for a claim confirmation number they said, “we’re unable to give you one but my manager is right here and she will file your claim after helping these customers”. We waited 3 weeks with no response. When I reached out to Breeze’s customer service about this, I only received multiple responses stating that since I did not file this claim at the airport desk per Breeze’s policy, they were unable to provide a refund. I repeatedly stated that I already did this, to which they ignored repeatedly and again referred to their policy, stating that it was a final decision and they will not be refunding me for my baggage. I have never had such a bad experience from an airline or such a horrible experience with an airline’s customer service. I encouraged everyone to use a different airline - the low price tag is a warning.

### "complete absence of customer service"
Worst customer service ever! Return flight from San Bernardino to SFO canceled due to weather (understandable), but rerouted to leave from LAX. Travel time from San Bernardino airport to LAX is 1.75 hours to 2 hours. We received notification of the change of departure at 10:35 AM for a 1 pm flight. We had just arrived at the San Bernardino airport, and there is no way we could have driven to LAX, returned our rental car, checked our bags, gone through security, and been at the gate in time for boarding. (Not to mention, needing to pay extra to turn in the rental car at a different airport.) The worst part is that because we had checked in online the day before (when the flight was still leaving on time from San Bernardino), and we were unable to cancel the flight on the app (the only way they do business, apparently), we were considered no-shows for the flight and not eligible for rebooking. We tried to rebook at the airport (for the same flight the following day,) but the agents use the same booking app as customers and were unable to rebook us. I called the "guest empowerment team" number we were given, which was a recording directing me to use the app which wasn't working. The agent acknowledged that the problem was that the airlines does not normally fly out of LAX, so the app was trying to rebook us out of LAX, and no flights were available because there ARE NONE! Their app wasn't smart enough to give us options from other area airports or realize that our original booking was out of San Bernardino. All it did was give a blue circle of death when we tried to change the flight. After finding a hotel to stay in my spouse finally found a phone number that got us someone who supposedly works for Breeze (they did not identify themselves or the airlines when they answered the phone, but upon questioning, admitted that they did work for Breeze). After asking for my confirmation number, they also asked for my username and password, I'm sure so they could use the same app I had been unsuccessfully using all day. They were unable to get us 3 seats on the next day's flight, but offered us two - at over $500 apiece! They claimed that the airline had notified us 24 hours in advance of the change, which was a blatant lie! I read all the correspondence I had with Breeze along with time stamps to the employee, to no avail. After being refused to speak to a supervisor, I refused to pay for rebooking and requested a refund. I was told that because we "no-showed" our flight we were not entitled to a refund. I don't know how this is legal or how to go about getting recourse for this horrible experience, but I will never fly Breeze again. I was happy to give them a try when our original Southwest flight was canceled in the Southwest meltdown, but the complete absence of customer service is unacceptable.

### "Terrible airline and deceptive"
Terrible airline and deceptive. Their website makes it seem as though you can cancel your flight anytime without penalty. It's on their main page. What they don't tell you is that if you do cancel you flight, they will only refund you in future flight credits. There's no way to get your money back. You have to do a deep dive on their website to find that out. Also, they don't disclose that you will have a layover until after you purchase your tickets. They call it a "Breezeway". I thought we were buying a direct flight until after I purchased the tickets, when Breeze revealed that there would be a "breezeway/layover" in San Francisco. When I tried to get a refund after discovering this, they would only issue a credit. That seems like a penalty to me. To make matters worse, they lost our luggage during that Breezeway, which we were fortunately able to recover 2 days later. However, they have yet to reimburse us for the items we needed to purchase for those 2 days. As a final stamp of their terrible service, they cancelled our return flight the morning of on New Years Day. So we had to scramble to get a flight from a more reputable airline, costing us another $2000. Breeze didn't offer any remedy other than we could try to reschedule with them on our own to try to get back in the next few days. The cancelled flight was reimbursed via future flight credits. Why would I ever want to fly in the future with such a terrible airline. Their main response has been to say they're sorry but they're not going to do anything about it.

### "does not offer any assistance"
Not Verified | I have a history of three bookings with this airline. The first booking was cancelled without any explanation the day before departure, and without any alternative Breeze flight on the days following the original travel date offered to us, leaving my daughter stranded at university. They refunded the cheap fare, but finding a replacement flight for my daughter proved to be extremely expensive for a last minute flight (3x the original Breeze fare). Totally screwed us. Our second booking was to get my family of 5 from LA to NY and the departing flight was fine, although delayed three hours. However, the return flight was cancelled (fog as Westchester Airport grounded all flights and delayed everyone), as the aircraft was diverted to nearby Bradley in CT. The agent told us the aircraft would eventually get to Westchester, as all those people on that inbound flight would need to find their way to Westchester. Not sure of all those peoples' fate, but apparently the aircraft never arrived, our flight was just cancelled. Breeze does not offer any assistance in rescheduling your flight. The next flight out was not until three days after our original flight. We were totally screwed here. We received an email that instructions would be sent "shortly" to help. The email did not arrive until late into the following day and the email just confirmed the flight was canceled and gave us options. However, the options link did not work in the phone app or on my laptop via their website. So I submitted an email asking what we should do. No response ever came. I filled out the form for a refund. No refund as of 5 days, but will check as they say 7 - 10 days.

### "Sorely disappointed"
Sorely disappointed. This was supposed to be our first time flying with Breeze, but they screwed up big time and we will never fly with them again. Our original flight was for yesterday night, but they delayed a few hours then rescheduled for this morning. This morning, they were delayed an hour or so, then all the sudden canceled completely. This is extremely unprofessional, but at least they refunded our tickets. Also, their online services are horrible and all their links go to their web page saying they don't believe in call centres. When you message them, it takes a day for them to respond so don't expect anything immediate if you're having issues.

### Breeze Airways customer review
The absolute worst airline I have ever flown. They canceled my flight yesterday and rescheduled for today. They have no agreements with other airlines to get a flight home. Then they did not board rescheduled flight until 2 hours later then scheduled time. No one was at the desk to provide information. Only after everyone on the plane did they announce the direct flight to Los Angeles was being directed to Tampa Florida where we would have to change planes because the plane we were on was missing a part? Do not fly this airline!

### "very worst experience I have had"
The very worst experience I have had. 3.5 hour delay in departing on a perfectly sunny day. Took over an hour for us to be informed they needed to dump fuel. Why that would take that long is beyond me or anyone else on the flight. There was a couple on the flight that I noticed before boarding, they were high as a kite and could barley stand, yet they were allowed on. 2 hours into the flight I noticed a flight attendant crying. also overheard another talking about working at chic filet in addition to being an attendant. They were 3 very young and inexperienced attendants, perfectly lovely but truly had no idea how to take care of business as usual, let alone a problem. 2 hours inflight the captain announced that we were landing. the couple i referred to were fighting, man smashed women's face into window, she spat at him, on and on. Kids in surrounding seats were super scared. some moved to the back of the plane. we landed in Kansas city close to 3 in the afternoon (flight was supposed to leave Westchester at 8:30 and arrive in LA at 11:30). the couple was escorted off flight by multiple air marshals. People on flight were questioned by authorities, roughly 2 hours later one of the marshals said we were good to go. Then we were told there was paperwork first, then refueling, then problem because the baggage was being unloaded. a total mess. Around 5pm we were told to exit plane and wait by the gate. It was not until after 8pm that we were told via email to come back in the morning. Note that it is understandable that the crew can only work so many hours but for multiple hours in Kansas city we were told we were waiting for a new crew. Then we found out there was never a new crew in transit. the original crew had left to get sleep for the next days flight to LA while we waited for nothing. No updates, NOTHING. In the end Breeze thought people would be happy with $150 credit toward a future flight with the airline. This was mismanaged from the beginning and a disaster all around. I wont address the fact that I missed a very important event.

### "Breeze is consistently late"
I would highly recommend using another airline if you need to arrive at your destination on time. Breeze is consistently late on every flight I’ve ever taken, sometimes by 5+ hours. Customer service is nonexistent, there is little communication, they do not offer compensation or amenities, and they do not offer explanations, even when weather is not a factor. The staff I have dealt with are nice but it doesn’t make up for the failures of the airline itself. Do better, Breeze.

### "Expect to depart late and arrive late"
Not Verified | Expect to depart late and arrive late. Our flights were always “on time” according to Breeze. But, we were always late both ways. I’ve now flown with them twice and must admit that they aren’t as awful as the reviews lead you to believe. However, this airline is not for time sensitive travelers.

### "Breeze was taking care of business"
Not Verified | Was scheduled to fly on Breeze during the travel mishap of December 2022 when so many flights were grounded. Want to give the highest praise to the airline. Take-off was delayed by 3 hours but the airline's communication was excellent, so we didn't show up to the airport early. They kept track of our luggage and there was no line at the ticket counter. When Southwest was cancelling flights and unable to accommodate passengers, Breeze was taking care of business.

### "got us home under terrible conditions"
Even though flight was very late and we had to go thru Charleston instead of straight flight to Columbus, they went the extra mile and got us home under terrible conditions and we are grateful

### "We were given no notice of the cancelled flight"
Not Verified |  Outbound flight not all that bad. They had to reboot the electrical system of the entire airplane before we could taxi. Stewardesses were not dressed or acting in a professional manner. I was put off by this non professional person welcoming me to the aircraft. Most had dirty hair and spent the majority of the flight talking very loudly in the galley. We were kept on the runway for at least 20 minutes in Nashville waiting for a gate. Bathroom on pane of very iffy cleanliness. However this was a good experience compared to the nightmare of trying to return to White Plains from Nashville! Our flight was scheduled to depart at 4.50pm, 12/26/22 and finally took off at 3.20pm, 12/27/22. We were given no notice of the cancelled flight on 12/26. We found out about the cancelation checking the departures board. When we went to the Breeze desk we were treated in a very rude and uncaring manner. At no time were we offered any apology, food or lodging compensation. Eventually Breeze started with a series of at least 12 texts/ emails for updates. Eventually we finally took off at approximately 3.20pm on Tuesday 12/27/22. This is much more than a snow delay. Clearly it was systemic incompetence and lack of respect for their customers. The entire waiting area in Nashville was filled with people who agreed with this assessment.

### "Terrible customer service"
Not Verified | Terrible customer service. No communication and zero customer service. Drove 2 hours checking the app and airport flight was still confirmed to fly out. Paid for parking and waited in the airport while the flight still said on time after an hour and no flight they canceled without texting or emailing. The lady then says due to lack of workers it’s canceled. Hours later get a text due to the storm. No snow or storm simply to cover themselves. Rescheduled flight get charged $150 in baggage fees. Like they say you really getting what you pay for. $100 to park, $150 for backs $100 for a room and a rental car fee they won’t reimburse. I get things happens but a simple hey sorry for the inconvenience and for sure will be the first and last flight with breeze. Save the frustration and your money fly with other airlines.

### "doesn't even give you a peanut"
We flew from Tampa to Las Vegas with a stop in Richmond. The flight lost over an hour to Las Vegas. Nothing mechanical, just ran late. We had a connection to make to Sacramento on another airline. We had two hours planned to make this connection which should have been plenty. But between the plane being an hour late and the luggage taking forty-five minutes to get, we missed our flight to Sacramento. It cost an additional $168 plus the $32 that we had paid to select seats. So, Breeze cost us $200 and five hours of waiting for our next flight. Will Breeze reimburse us for our loss? It was 100% their fault. NO, they will not. It's their "policy". Well, it's my policy to never fly Breeze again. A cross country flight that doesn't even give you a peanut and charges $3.50 for water. No thanks.

### "Worst customer service"
Not Verified |  Great price. Worst customer service I have ever experienced. I'm trying to change my flight and the website nor the app will recognize my confirmation. They say we don't have phone support because they don't want people on hold. Their response to email and message is extremely delayed. They will not get in a chat except for bots.

### "First class is nothing close to a first class experience"
Not Verified |  If it is possible to get less than you pay for Breeze Airways has found out how to do it. In an effort to save you money they provide no person service on the phone or at the airport. Naturally when everything is working this is no problem, but seeing as this airline has managed to delay or cancel a huge percentage of its flights the added stress of no customer service except email or text is not worth the money you save. First class is nothing close to a first class experience, our seats were broken (this on the highly touted new airplanes), flight attendants hide out as much as they can and look like they have just graduated from high school. Not the attendant crew you feel you would want in an emergency. Both inbound and outbound flights were delayed hours on days with perfect weather. No explanations except the outbound flight delay was partially caused by maintenance on seats that weren't working. Imagine our surprise when we found out it was our "first class" seats that were broken.

### "Breeze Airways is not worth it"
Not Verified |  Our family was to fly out at 7:55 pm. After numerous delays, we are scheduled at 11:15 pm. We should have arrived in Charleston at 9:20 pm! Other friends have already arrived from other cities ! We have not been given any information except delays through texts. They did finally announce at 9:30 our plane has left Nashville for Canton. We are all waiting for our plane to arrive at 11:00 to be told our flight is now cancelled. We only live 15 minutes from the airport and could have gone home hours ago if this was the scenario that was going to play out. I guess you get what you pay for. Breeze Airways is not worth it.

### "use your hard earned money elsewhere"
After multiple delays Flight MX327 left White Plains, NY for New Orleans, LA. Flight was characterized as a breeze through Jacksonville, FL ie no requirement to get off the plane. Flight lands late around 11pm and then they say we will not be continuing on this evening so sleep in the airport or grab a hotel, your choice. So people with no business in Jacksonville FL found themselves scrambling to find accommodation. Passengers were told flight would resume in the morning with a 9am departure, it is now almost 11am and everyone is still at Jacksonville airport. The Breeze app is worthless as you cannot get your new boarding pass the following day after a delayed flight. This created numerous issues for travelers when trying to get through TSA security. After multiple attempts to text, call, email Breeze Airways we have yet to hear anything other than the flight was canceled. I would say use your hard earned money elsewhere. These guys don’t know how to run a customer focused business.

### "definitely be riding with Breeze again"
This was my first time flying Breeze Airways and I had only heard good things. As I was checking into my flight I realized that I had booked 2 flight for my friend and I and made a mistake with the name on the second flight not permitting her pass to be printed. I was directed to their help center which I was uneasy about since I had used Allegiant's call center just months earlier and waited on hold for 3 hours. Since my flight was taking off within the hour i headed to the text center and got a response from Margie within minutes. She was extremely helpful and within 15 minutes she had helped me switch the name on my second pass to be printed. I was so nervous that I wouldn't be able to get on my flight but the customer service was above and beyond to help me even at 7:30 in the evening! Both Aresha at the counter and Margie on customer service were so helpful! I will definitely be riding with Breeze again.

### "do not recommend flying Breeze"
I commute back and forth between Florida and Massachusetts and have flown Breeze frequently in the last year. I found the staff to be mostly courteous, if not always knowledgeable about delays or rules for baggage (in my case allowances for separate bag of medical equipment). The seats are comfortable and not as tightly packed in as other airlines like Spirit, which I have also flown quite a bit. Lately, however, every flight has been delayed, causing problems with rides on either end of the flight. My flight the day before Thanksgiving was cancelled and so I missed Thanksgiving with my family because alternative airlines did not offer feasible prices or flights. I took the next Breeze flight out of Sarasota which was delayed multiple times and my rides to and from the airport had to cancel, which was expensive and time consuming. Flights are often delayed on the tarmac as well, waiting on maintenance issues and waiting for runways, or waiting for a gate upon return. Of course, waiting on a plane is much worse for passengers than waiting in the airport. While I initially was thrilled with the prices and nonstop options, I do not recommend flying Breeze unless you have unlimited time, patience and no problem finding rides to and from the airport.

### "No help or interest whatsoever"
After 6 delays some at the last minute my flight from Hartford to Tampa left 11 hours late. After a two-hour wait in Charleston, the flight was cancelled at 2:30 on Sunday morning. Gate staff were more than useless. No help or interest whatsoever. A mom with three little kids was near-hysterical with no place to go. Then they closed the gate area, ended up sleeping on airport bench until rental car kiosk opened and drove 7 hours to Tampa. Meanwhile, they sent me numerous texts rescheduling flight (first one was 8.30 pm next evening, then that was delayed three times and then finally cancelled also). Are you a masochist? Then attempt to fly Breeze.

### "show what flying should be like"
Delta Platinum Medallion flyer for over 10 years, and Northwest before that. I gladly take Breeze anytime possible from Fort Myers, Sarasota, Charleston and Hartford. Planes are new, seats are spacious and comfortable, the lavatories are larger then the phone booths on most legacy carriers where if you are 6'-2" or taller good luck hitting your head on the fuselage ceiling. Occasional delays but they always got to the destination and in the process saved connections in ATL, CLT, LGA and 3 or 4 extra hours to get where you wanted to go because the fare jockeys at United, Delta, American all believe the shortest flight duration you should pay more for to gild their pockets. Love Breeze hope they expand service and show what flying should be like.

### "I have no complaints"
Flew the day before thanksgiving without any issues what so ever. I have always flown delta but have to stop in Atlanta. I wanted to give this a shot with the giant price difference. Was 554$ for 2 tickets plus my baggage delta a little over 2k. I have no complaints. New clean plane. Nice helpful workers. Could def see the airline being under staffed at a larger airport or if they ran into issues. But none of that happened. I’m glad to have a cheap direct flight from MSY to SAV

### "nothing for the added stress"
The flight down kept getting delayed. Finally a captain announced that the 3 hr delay was becauze the first officer was delayed the night before and needed the 10hr break between flying days. Ok, fine. Then, for the return that's when the nightmare started. Breeze canceled my return flight at 2am the day of, after checking in with no notice of potential delay or cancelations. They do not help find a new flight or accommodate for added stress of finding a new, last minute flight. They did allow me to cancel for a full refund and will reimburse the difference from that to the cost of booking a new flight. So decent reimbursements but nothing for the added stress or help getting on a new flight. Luckily we had our accommodations at the destination for 1 extra night due to their reservation requirements, so we aren't having for fork out additional money for a hotel. Don't book with Breeze if you want to have any hope of your flights leaving as intended.

### "they can’t seem to run the business"
Not Verified |  Absolutely terrible. Had me check in only to cancel in the middle of the night for the day before thanksgiving! Claim staff issues? Why have me check in then? It’s great to have a direct flight from CT to Sarasota but they can’t seem to run the business - bad!

### "the worst airline hands down"
Breeze is the worst airline hands down. They delayed my flight and made everyone wait 5 hours before canceling the flight. I got delayed 4 times before they canceled out of the blue. I had to contact them on FACEBOOK and wait 1 hour to find out that they had mechanical issues and that is why it was delayed (lady at the desk was no help. They also seemed way understaffed. Now I have to drive over 1 hour to LaGuardia Airport because they have no flights the next day (next flight is on black Friday after thanksgiving at the Hartford Airport). I also had to pay more money for the Delta flight to get to Jacksonville because my family took time off to see me and I am not there because they canceled the flight. If the planes have issues they should not being flying them.

### "Do not travel Breeze Airways"
Not Verified |  Constant delays and after waiting some four hours, the flight was canceled yesterday - or rather "delayed" overnight to the next morning. Communication and information was spotty and no customer service number. We were told via email that because of FAA requirements, the crew had to rest. I checked in this morning at 8:30 am for a 10:20 flight only to be informed via email that the flight was now delayed until 11:50. Will I ever get off the ground and get home? What t fresh horror awaits us today at the hands of the bumbling Breeze? My advice: Do not travel Breeze Airways. Book another airline.

### "slow, unhelpful and untrained"
Painful customer service: slow, unhelpful and untrained. Even though I had checked in online at home, took over 30 min at desk to check luggage, get tags, get physical boarding pass for my party of three passengers. We needed special assistance, a wheelchair, for one passenger and they called the wrong place, told me to wait but finally I had to go to wheelchair assistance myself. On the plane in nicest cabin, flight attendants used 2 overhead bins for their personal items and we couldn't use the ones above our seats in row 1. My backpack was removed from one bin, and rather than put it into the next overhead bin, the flight attendant placed at my feet, so I had to unbuckle, wait for loading passengers to pass then put into open spot right before take off. Unhelpful. Any time that's happened before on Delta, Virgin, American, Jet Blue, they move for you to minimize your inconvenience.

### "Flight cancelled for no reason"
Flight cancelled for no reason. Was told by several people on Southwest flight to Syracuse that Breeze would cancel for no reason and then, yes, my flight was cancelled. Could not reach a customer service rep. Could not reschedule through Breeze. So had to extend time is Syracuse an extra day to find flight.

### "delayed every time"
Not Verified | Tampa to Charleston. I fly this airline twice a month and it is delayed every time. The communication from the airline is terrible and the gate personnel have no idea because nobody tells them.

### "Communication and updates horrible"
Airplane and staff was excellent. Communication and updates horrible. I was on a flight to Vegas and just like the one on the inbound was delayed over two hours. I understand new routes have growing pains but the departure board at the airport had the wrong gate and I was sitting in a common area with clear view of the tarmac where the plane was suppose to arrive. I checked for updates about every 10-15 min. and not only did the board never change but they did not update the departure time either, it just said delayed. I did receive an update email that the flight would be departing at 12.35 with out updated gate information. I then checked the board and not change so I found a rep of the airport and he told me after looking at the departure board again that gate is not being used. I then saw a plane at a different gate and got on the plane luckily because it was delayed because of fuelling. They told me my seat was double booked and lost me first class seat. When I asked for my upgrade refunded they would not because I was considered a no show and never addressed their lack of updates or giving the correct info to the airport. If I could I would love to attach these correspondences so you can see the absurdities of their responses. Let me say again the plane was awesome and the on plane service was great.

### "not having Customer Service lines"
Not Verified |  This airline thinks that not having a Customer Service lines to speak to a live person is a good idea! It’s cold and disconnected to only have option to text for questions. It took 5 hours to exchange 5 texts with an agent(s) to get 1 question answered! It’s not worth the few dollars of savings from my other go to airline that has live agent to speak to 24 hours a day.

### "I think its worth giving Breeze a shot"
Maybe I got lucky, but I was pleasantly surprised. I was thrilled to have a more affordable AND more importantly, direct flight form South Carolina back to my home area in California. In my 15+ years of living in SC, this had never before been possible. Both my departure and return flights were on time, and my departure flight actually got me out early which was great. The staff on the flight out of CHS wasn't as friendly as the return flight from SFO, but nothing major to report. The plane itself was newer, on one of the trips however there was a coffee stain that had never been cleaned up properly on my tray. The airline is no thrills, so don't expect a full meal to order or in-plane movies for a long flight. Also if you need to talk to a customer service person outside of your flight you can only get in touch with a rep online through chat services and virtual means which frustrates many people. However if you have an issue at the airport, reps are on hand to help. Long story short, if you go into all of that knowing the disadvantages but placing a higher value in getting a better priced airfare and a direct flight somewhere you can't normally, I think its worth giving Breeze a shot. There were so many app complaints but I didn't experience anything anyone else complained of. I am very grateful this airline offers direct flights now from my location. I think they are new and probably working out a lot of kinks, all things considered I think they might deserve more credit than people give them. I will probably fly them again as long as I am living in this location.

### "one of the best flight experiences ever"
Not Verified | After reading so many negative reviews, I was more than a little apprehensive about our trip. I am so happy that everything was perfect. In all honesty, the flight was 30 minutes late. Who cares? With air travel what it is these days 30 minutes was nothing. The aircraft seemed brand new. The flight attendants attentive without being annoying. Smooth flights from Akron to Tampa and back. We did not check baggage so I cannot speak to that. Overall one of the best flight experiences ever.

### "Round trip was perfect"
Pleasantly surprised after so many bad reviews. Round trip was perfect. Minimal delays, comfy seats, friendly staff, smooth flight. Going, we were given water and m&m’s. Back we got nothing, but it was only an hour. I’d definitely fly Breeze again

### "Might want to skip Breeze Airways"
Both flights to and from on my trip with Breeze Airways was at least 2 hrs late. During my trip I was was sent probably 10 status alerts of the trip which was annoying along with emails saying you might want to change your flight because they overbooked or you might lose your seat. They have no customer service number, so don't think you're gonna speak to someone. At the last minute they changed our gate, And it was confusing because they were boarding another flight at the same gate. Might want to skip Breeze Airways unless you want to be frustrated, confused and 3 hours to kill!

### "separated us on the flight back"
This will be my first and last flight if they don’t get better. My friend and I traveled to Las Vegas for the weekend and they separated us on the flight back to Salt Lake City because we didn’t pay for the seat, no other airline does that. So many other little things that I didn’t like it. I will go back to buy my flight tickets from a better airline definitely.

### "may consider them in the future if they get their act together"
Not Verified |  Horrible first experience. From West Palm Beach to Norfolk great experience. We're not high maintenance. However, our return flight was canceled for "maintenance issues" at boarding. However I suspect it was personnel issues. I never saw a single crew member arrive. They said, next flight on Friday (5 days later!). They don't help with rebooking. Gate agent said "go to your app and check "support"). Had to purchase a last minute ticket with a connection and finally got home at 2.30 am. They say they will refund half the fare and cover us for expenses up to $500 per passenger but it will take 28 days. I submitted the form and receipt for my new ticket and received acknowledgement via email. I may consider them in the future if they get their act together.

### "forced to buy a last minute flight on another airline"
Don't Fly this airline, unless you have free days on your hands. I booked a flight for my wife from Nashville to Tulsa, and decided to try out Breeze Airways. Everything looked good until last night. While I was checking email, I found one from Breeze, that said "sorry, we canceled your flight tomorrow due to crew availability. We booked you on the same flight for the next day". The message said we could get a hotel room and it would be reimbursed, or refund the flight or contact us from a link on the web site. Then I go to the website, and find the only communication is through facebook messenger, twitter or email. I try facebook and get a message that says...we are busy, it will be several hours before we get to you. This is at 9.30 pm. So, no way to talk to a real person, no help from their "guest empowerment team" that is supposed to offer rebooking options. Found out later, they don't rebook on other airlines. So, we were forced to buy a last minute flight on another airline. No compensation, no help, no customer service. If you book on Breeze, its like throwing dice, maybe you fly, probably you dont. We wont be trying them again.

### "very disappointing experience"
Awful experience. First time flyer on Breeze. Took a week off to visit my grandmother in West Palm Beach. They canceled the flight moments after we were supposed to board. The only option was to buy a ticket from another airline, which was now way too expensive last minute. Their next scheduled departure date was the day I was supposed to go back home. Horrible, very disappointing experience that made my grandmother cry. I'll never fly them again.

### "Horrible experience"
Not Verified |  Horrible experience. Made us wait all day, then not cancelling but “delaying” our flight 25 hours. No compensation. Now we’ve waited two hours to get our bags. No information at all.

### "Never again will I book a flight with Breeze"
Not Verified |  Had my first Breeze flight booked from Hartford to Norfolk. Received a text 12 hours before my flight was scheduled to depart that my flight was cancelled due to "unforeseen circumstances. Now I am scrambling to rebook because I must be in Norfolk on Friday. Never again will I book a flight with Breeze. They lost a customer before they ever had a customer.

### "Worst airline experience I've ever had"
Worst airline experience I've ever had. Reimbursement communication I was given by airport Breeze representatives was false! Our flight turned back around mid-air with a mechanical issue. We were told a new plane would be arriving later in the day. Eight hours after our flight was scheduled to leave, we were told flight crew on the substitute plane had timed out and the flight would leave the following day. Passengers were told to save receipts because we would be reimbursed for meals at the airport up to $20. This was not honored. I was also told by airport Breeze representatives that rebooking on another airline up to $200 would be reimbursed. This was also not honored. To make matters worse, they don't even have a customer service line for you to speak with someone in person. I've had bad travel experiences in the past, but I've never experienced being lied to by an airline. I spent at least three times more in the airport and finding a substitute ticket than what my ticket cost with Breeze.

### "My experience was great"
I almost didn't book this ticket when looking over the reviews on this site for this airline. It's a good thing I took a critical eye to a lot of the reviews. I'm not saying that their reviews are wrong, but they don't paint the whole picture. I fly regularly for work and I spend roughly 30k a year on travel. I am flexible about airlines. When I fly Spirit Airlines, I don't complain that they don't give me water. I carry my own water bottle. I tend to heavy prefer nonstop flights and a particular route that I have to fly at least 4 times a year, SFO-RIC, didn't have a direct route until Breeze came along. I usually book a direct flight from SFO-IAD for about $500 and then pay a rental car to drive the two hours south so that I don't have to connect through CLT, which has never been on time. Enter Breeze with a sale that allowed me to book a first class ticket for half the cost on just the ticket and I took the chance. It was great. The airplane was new. The flight attendants were courteous. My experience was great. Is everyone's? Probably not. Breeze is a new airline and I imagine a lot of their flights might get shuffled around. I see a common theme from the reviews are connections that don't have direct flights otherwise. Well, it seems that's the type of market Breeze is trying to do business in. It's a business. I can see how it's a gamble. Sometimes flights don't fill up and things don't work out. It's possible that this review may not stand the test of time, but I for now, I had an amazing experience. My seat reclined super far and I could not have had better sleep in a newer plane. I plan to urge my travel partners to add Breeze into their systems ASAP so I can book easier for work.

### "the bathrooms are broken"
I don't mind a delay but a delay that the bathrooms are broken and can be fixed in a quick 2-3 minutes by changing a breaker then turned into an hour on the plane and still flying with no bathrooms  like what?

### "I will definitely fly with them again"
I have to give a great review based on what I paid for this flight. Breeze was the only airline that offered a one way flight from Charleston to Orlando, at an extremely reasonable price. I didn’t pay for my seat, I didn’t check a bag. It was a 46 minute flight, amazing. You don’t have to crawl over a bunch of people if you need to use the lavatory. If you’re willing to pay for extra leg room, have at it. I didn’t. My seat was a little tight but again, I was only in the air for 46 minutes. They offer drinks, snacks, and even alcohol for purchase (on a 46 minute flight!) I had a great experience. They don’t have wifi but they do have a website to connect to for you to watch free movies or tv shows they provide, which was great. There some air pockets we endured on the way down which gave me some anxiety but the pilot did a smooth and wonderful landing. I will definitely fly with them again. PS they also have a cool (never seen one before) tiny table above your snack table on the seat in front of you that holds your phone or small tablet while you enjoy the free movie or TV!

### "I'll never fly Breeze again"
Delays, delays, delays. If you can get boarded. And that's a big if. The plane is clean and updated and the flight went off without a hitch. Unfortunately we're three delays into our return flight with no end in sight. I'll never fly Breeze again.

### "All the plane's staff were not friendly"
Not Verified |  We chose this airline, even though we didn't know it because it said the flight was direct, but it stopped to fill up on gas both ways. There is no priority for people with disabilities, regarding the assignment of chairs, they gave us the last two in which there is no option to move anywhere. We talked to the employees if a change was possible and it wasn't possible. They don't even offer water, everything has to be bought. The rows for the bathroom in economy class are very long. All the plane's staff were not friendly.

### "denied boarding without giving a valid reason,"
Not Verified |  Don’t ever fly this airline. They denied boarding to my mother’s caregiver without giving a valid reason, we confirmed later with TPA airport security, leaving my 94 year old mother without a flight to her assisted living facility in VA. They made up their minds that they couldn’t be bothered to actually do anything other than cancel the tickets, simply stating that “they had made their final business decision”. This was all communicated by text because her family was waiting to receive her in VA, and they refused to give us a contact number. We were able to book my mother and her caregiver on a different airline on the same travel date, proving that the problem was entirely created by Breeze and they clearly don’t have a conscience.

### "Poor customer service"
I booked a flight with this new airline in May 2022 for a flight in Sept 2022 for a wedding in Las Vegas. The day after I booked the flight I tried to login and cancel the flight as I heard horrible reviews about cancellations at the last minute. I tried for days to login, was told to reset password and nothing worked. When I finally was able to chat with someone I was informed it was too late to cancel my tickets. Now I am stuck with some plane tickets I can't use. Poor customer service. The flights had not even started and won't until August for this destination. I tried to get the credit card company to refuse the charges but they were unsuccessful. I wouldn't fly my dog on the airline.

### "the flight back home was an ultimate disaster"
This previous weekend was my first time flying with Breeze Airways. Our flight to Orlando was perfect. However, the flight back home to Charleston, South Carolina was an ultimate disaster. After being notified that our flight would be delayed, we thought that we would have a little more time to get to the airport. We were never notified that the flight’s time was different from what we were notified from. Luckily, we made it on time. Upon arriving in Charleston South Carolina we waited to collect our bags, however our luggage was not there. The only thing that was done for us was that we were told to fill out a baggage clean form and that they would do the best that they could. This is very disheartening, because we are in need of our clothing and toiletries. I Know that these things often times happens, But this is unacceptable.

### "most pleasant recent experience"
Our family of 6 flew out of Akron to Tampa. From booking flights, customer reps at both airports, aircraft condition, flight staff, comport on board to special requests-zero issues and only praise for Breeze. My wife an I travel a lot and using Breeze was the most pleasant recent experience we've had vs. other major airlines. Flight cancellations/delays are not specific to one airline-watch the news these days. Staff shortages are now the norm. All Airline apps have their issues in our experience. We will use Breeze as much as possible when available for our domestic destinations.

### "so happy to have a direct flight option"
Round trip - both flights on-time or early, comfortable seat, reasonable fare & a rare (maybe only?) direct flight option from Jacksonville FL to Hartford CT. App is simple but worked great, got the job done. Cabin Wi-Fi worked well. Pricing structure is very low base + just about everything is an add-on…including seat selection, carry-on, and even the on-flight snacks are for purchase. A small bag/purse is free, but check the carry on sizes and prices - a little different. Limited flight options. Again, all fine with me, so happy to have a direct flight option & even with the a la carte style pricing it was way lower cost than any other option.

### "customer service is non existent"
Not only is their app garbage but so is the airline. The customer service is non existent. App does not let you pay for your carry on or check bags half the time which means they charge you $50 at the gate. Forget reaching out to customer service as well. You can't get ahold of a real person and when you email them you barely get a response. I've received one email in 5 days. Was also promised a $20 credit via email from Breeze for a delay I suffered & they never actually applied it to my account. Do not recommend unless you do not plan on using the app or plan on paying $50 for a carry on.

### "It's clearly a bait and switch operation"
They switched at the last 2nd to a company called global X crossings. This company has planes that are well over 16 years old. They also do not have a first class. The staff at Breeze admitted during check in that they didn't have any planes they just rented out some planes. It's clearly a bait and switch operation which I would call fraudulent. There is no phone number to contact Breeze personnel personnel and they take forever to respond to emails. This airline is not worth taking even a second of your time to consider flying with. Take a look at the "1st class" seating in the pictures I supplied with this review.

### "They are non-existent with customer service"
If I could enter a negative number, I would - seriously. This is the worst airline I have ever dealt with. They are non-existent with customer service and they stole from me by refusing to refund my card after they canceled my flight. They offered me Breeze points towards a future flight, although all flights out of LA are now canceled or terminated through 2023. I am in process of disputing this but would highly encourage anyone to not do business with Breeze. They are a scam and impossible to contact. Please consider other airline alternatives. Their business should be shut down.

### "I cannot recommend this airline"
After an eight hour wait in Charleston, our flight was finally cancelled. We rented a car and drove to Tampa. Then when we were checking on our return flight, it disappeared from the App. No notification that it was cancelled. No email, no text. Nothing. Tried every way possible to reach their customer service. I'm not sure they have customer service. Certainly not a phone number! DM to Breeze on twitter. They told us to use email, text, or Facebook instant messenger. Tried all three. No response (it has been over four days). Showed up at the Tampa airport on the day of our flight, and was told that our round trip booking was completely cancelled. After about two or three hours of standing at the ticketing counter, they finally agreed to reinstate our return flight for the original cost. They initially wanted to charge us twice the price! I cannot recommend this airline for anyone!

### "not reliable or trustworthy"
Not Verified |  They canceled my trip 3 weeks before. Now it would cost me an arm and a leg to fly with another carrier. I’ll now be driving. They are not reliable or trustworthy. Pass them up.

### "worst airline experience I've ever had"
This airline is nightmarish. I flew with them once with delays but overall the experience wasn't terrible; however, when I booked my second and third trips with them it became apparent how inept they are. Five days before my trip they canceled my flight out of nowhere with no explanation. The only offered choices for resolution were to rebook the flight within fourteen days of the original departure date or get a refund of $160 for the canceled roundtrip flight. There were three snags with this: firstly, I needed the specific dates scheduled as I had booked over $1,200 worth of stays and activities at my destination which were non-movable (due to it being a holiday weekend) and non-refundable. Secondly, no other flights to and from my destination were even available within the allotted fourteen day window, so even if I hypothetically wished to take advantage of that resolution path it would have been entirely moot. Thirdly, because they waited until five days before the flight to cancel it, I had to pay $400 to rebook with a different airline, far more than my initial $160. When I went to their customer support page to get help with the myriad issues they created, I found out there is no way to call them for assistance. Instead, you must text message them. I text messaged them within five minutes of being notified my flight was canceled. The automated response said it would take "several hours" for a response. It took more than a day and half. When they did respond, they offered less than zero help. They offered the same two options given online with zero empathy, explanation or apology for their actions. They basically said "screw you, we don't care. They did not care about the extra expenses I incurred, would not assist even one iota with those expenses when asked, and did not seem to care that they had created a nightmare scenario through their own ineptitude. Because I had one more trip booked with them for later this year and I no longer trust them to honor their agreements, I requested a refund for that trip. Their bot-like agent offered me "breeze points" in lieu of a refund. Despite multiple appeals to empathy, common sense, and functionally begging for any leniency, decency or kindness, they merely stated "this is our final business decision. Their customer support is non-existent. They are happy to take your money, but will not honor their commitments to their customers; worse, when asked for accommodation and assistance due to their ineptitude, they refuse to issue even the mildest of apologies, proffer any explanation for their despicable behavior. Thank goodness I booked these trips on my Amex Platinum, so getting the refund through them was much easier. Unlike Breeze "Airways" (I can barely deign to call them an airline as they don't deserve the name) Amex actually cares about its customers and was happy to assist me inside of fifteen minutes and resolve my issues inside of another ten minutes on the phone. Breeze could learn heaps from them. This was the most irritating, least productive, and worst airline experience I've ever had and I've flown to twenty countries and thirty-eight states. I'd give zero stars if possible; avoid at all costs!

### "my flight was cancelled"
Earlier this spring, I purchased three tickets for my family Los Angeles to Norfolk on 07JUL22 on Breeze. Saturday, 25 June I received an email from Breeze telling me my flight was cancelled, and I could rebook or cancel for a refund. The link to rebook did not work, so I tried to reach out to Breeze. There is no one to call, one can only text or reach out via facebook. I sent a text at 9:50 that morning, and at 10:32 p.m. Pacific time (over 12 hours later) I received a two-word response, "Hi Michael. I was subsequently told that there would be no re-booking options for this flight. I get it that cancellations happen. But it is ridiculous that passengers are informed less than two weeks prior to departure that the airline won't be flying this route until February (if then). Now I get to pay a last-minute fare for a connecting flight for three of us. Buyer beware.

### "I will never fly this airline again"
Not Verified |  This airline completely ruined our summer. Me, my husband, and my 2 kids were flying from LAX to Norfolk when our flights were cancelled yesterday. We were already packing, as the trip was only a few days away. We were all disappointed, my kids especially. I will make sure to never fly this airline again. This airline seemed great because of the cheap prices, but no wonder its cheap, they cancel everyones flights. I tried to rebook, but the next flight flying out of LAX was in February 2023. So I would not use this airline if you want to go somewhere because chances are, your flight will be cancelled. This would have been my first time flying with this airline, but I will never fly this airline again.

### "not worth the savings"
Unfortunately I never got to make this trip. All flights on this route cancelled until February 2023. No email about cancellation, I found out by randomly going to the website and saw my flight cancelled. Not a professional way to run a business. I flew with them to Norfolk VA last October and that was pleasant. But after this incident I will not be flying them again, not worth the savings when you have to make last minute changes at additional cost.

### "all of my fights were delayed"
Not Verified |  Their system can’t handle known traveler number! I asked at the check in desk and they couldn’t find it. I keep a copy of the TSA letter with me and they still couldn’t find it. Had to go through the long line. Lost a day of vacation due to no flight staff. Additionally, all of my fights were delayed (some several times)

### "hands down the worst"
Not Verified |  First, they cancel our flight after 2 delays. Which aside from the loss of an entire day and schedule disruption, wouldn't be terrible, but their employees at the counter abandoned it, leaving only a sign saying to use their app for support.. Our bags were nowhere to be found, support wouldn't answer, they were not at the baggage claim. We lost several more hours just trying to find our bags we dropped off hours earlier when checking in. After rescheduling, I completed my journey.. but the pilot we had on the return flight was obviously new, they didn't do any snack or beverage service, citing "bad weather" as we flew between two calm, sunny destinations with no turbulence. It was quite obvious at takeoff and landing, I've never been on a flight that shook so much in clear weather. Now I'm sitting on the tarmac here, we arrived "on time" 25 minutes ago but for some reason we don't have a gate to deboard? In my 16 years of flying several times a year domestic and international, this is hands down the worst.

### "This airline is a complete scam"
Not Verified |  Never got to fly with them because they cancelled my flights twice. The first time they cancelled the return flight for my whole family and I had to extend my trip to take their next available flight which takes a lot of additional booking and planning (lodging, transportation, etc. ), then one week before our trip they cancelled all flights. So after working around their initial failure, they cancelled our entire trip ONE WEEK BEFORE. At this point trying to rebook with another airline is far too expensive being so close to the date and during a holiday which is why we booked our trip early in the first place! Now we have to go through cancelling every booking and plan we had and having to pay cancellation fees for everything because Breeze Airways absolutely screwed us. This is too far. I don't know how they are in business. After seeing every review on their social media page, it looks like every single person has had their flights cancelled by Breeze and even worse, the day of. This airline is a complete scam. Consider yourself warned! Don't believe me? Research reviews, check their social media comments...all the same thing. It's not right for them to keep doing this to people.

### "proven to be completely unreliable"
Tried out the airline due to nonstop flight from TPA to RIC. On 6/23, flight was delayed but we still departed and I made my business dinner on time. I was set to depart the next day on 6/24. I received a text at 1 a.m. advising the flight was cancelled and rebooked for Saturday - zero explanation or support info. I was forced to rebook my hotel and cancel pre-made plans on both Friday and Saturday as a result. I made the best of up and was ready to leave the next morning for the reset 11 a.m. flight. However, at 1 am, I again received a text message that my flight was delayed and not departing until after 3. I have now had to beg for refunds for preplanned ticked and events in TPA that I no longer can attend due to these delays. I tried to get in touch with Support to just get answers and options, and I was met with an automatic text response that they are very busy and a response would not be given until several hours later. I was willing to try and recommend this airline to others. The planes themselves are quite nice, but they have proven to be completely unreliable. Will not use them again unless they overcome this horrendous reputation they have developed at this point.

### "Recommend avoiding"
This airline may be a fine choice when they sort out their problems, but I didn't have the opportunity to actually fly with them. I was excited to find a much better fare than any major airline flying SFO to RIC for a business conference, and nonstop as well. However two days before the flight I received a one sentence text message saying the flight was cancelled. This is the first thing to sort out--send the apologetic email with links for getting a refund first, not the curt text message! I was not pleased to see that. The next available flight on Breeze was one week later (maybe... if they don't cancel it). In the end my full fare was refunded, but the new flight on United cost about 80% more than the Breeze fare ($250 more). I was given a $50 credit in "Breeze Points," but when I asked they refused to refund that to me as cash as a goodwill gesture. And, I'm in Richmond waiting to go home, and I see that both Breeze's flights to Tampa and SFO have been cancelled today. Recommend avoiding until they develop a better reputation.

### " Gave them a try, never again"
A hour and a half late leaving Tampa. Plane was there 5 hours at gate then they pulled one as I watched from the what appears to be fix it lot. Captain repeatedly states please give us another chance at Tampa. After letting us board knowing they had to cut plane off for 10 minutes with no ac to restart computer. Then they cancel flight home at 0100 day before flight. They expect me to pay extra 2 days Hotel stay. Next flight was Monday. Canceled flight was Saturday. Then they think 50 credit dollars covers my last minute flight costs to get home to work Sunday. We're nurses. They lost me. They beg for a second chance then cancel. Gave them a try, never again.

### "just not ready for flight"
Not Verified |  This airline is just not ready for flight. They cancel and delay flights with little notice and no assistance. They really do not have customer service available in any meaningful way or channel. They took away our purchased first class (nicest class) seats with little more than an e-mail. Most unsettling is their crew admit to being unfamiliar with their aircraft. When asked about the equipment we got a shrug and “it is new so we don’t know”. They just are unprofessional, untrained, unprepared and not ready. They do not deserve your trust.

### "recommend avoiding Breeze Airways"
Just had the worst customer service experience of my life with Breeze Airways. Two days before my flight was scheduled to depart, they emailed me with a notification that my flight had been cancelled. No opportunity for recourse, no phone number on their website, and no response for almost 24 hours to the emails, sms messages, and messenger app messages I sent. Even worse, if and when they do finally respond to you, it turns out that they won't even help you rebook a comparable flight. It's basically, "Sorry, you're out of luck. This is absolutely unacceptable. I built my vacation around the availability of this flight. As a result of their mistakes, I had to book a far worse flight at a far greater cost that will not get me to my destination in time to work the next day, which means that I am also losing income. Overall, their mistakes are costing me hundreds of dollars and a lot of wasted time and energy, and they offer no real compensation or even sincere apologies for what they have done. I know budget flights are tempting, but given my experience here I would highly recommend avoiding Breeze Airways. They are worse than all others.
