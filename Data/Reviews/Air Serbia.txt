### “a great experience”
Not Verified | I had a wonderful experience flying with AirSerbia on their ATR72-600 aircraft. The check-in process was fast and efficient. Boarding was smooth and hassle-free. Onboard the treats were simple yet delightful. The seats were comfortable, and the cabin was clean and well-maintained. One of the only downside was the loudness of the aircraft, but this is a common characteristic of the ATR72-600. Additionally, wifi service was not present, which is not unusual for the aircraft type and short flight duration. IFE was not available but not expected for this flight, the in flight magazine make up for that well. Overall, it was a great experience.

### “They couldn't care less”
Not Verified | I am gold fréquent flyer of Aegean Star Alliance. I have probably taken 300 flights in my file, this one is by far the worst experiences I've had. First of all, if you take the light economy flight, they don't recognize your gold status despite Air Serbia being a member of Star Alliance. Then I was among the first in the line to board and they let all the people with seat 15+ board first even if they arrived later, so we had to queue again after queuing for boarding and let half the plane go before us. It was a connecting flight with 45 min for transfer. Of course the first flight had 45 min delay so we missed the second flight. At the transfer desk they tell us to wait on the side and a transfer will pick us up to take us to a hotel give us a meal and drive us back to the airport for a flight boarding at 1 am and landing at 03:20 am (lovely!) and guess what? They forgot at least 3 people. We have been waiting for 1h30 and they just "forgot us" there. They didn't make any announcement whatsoever and just left. And since then there has been a 2 hour queue at the counter we have been a couple of times and they just tell us to wait someone will come. Of course they didn't tell us they forgot us, we found out by chance through another customer... I have been very polite and patient waiting quietly to be called, but this outrageous. They couldn't care less. Air Serbia never again!

### "luggage was appearing as unpaid"
Not Verified |  I was travelling from Oslo to Athens via Belgrade. Flight delayed 2 hrs at Oslo, no explanation given. Upon arrival at Belgrade, clueless staff and no company representative who could responsibly answer questions and provide guidance. Seriously unorganized transfer process from the airport to the hotel. Endlessly waiting for the bus and losing further time due to the amateur way of boarding the passengers. Instead of taking us to our final destination in Athens, they flew us to Thessaloniki and exhausted us further, by being indecisive on which connecting flight we should board for Athens - at some point, they even suggested us to fly from Belgrade to Vienna and from there to Athens! Upon our arrival at Thessaloniki, our paid for luggage was appearing as unpaid at the system. I know at least another passenger who had to pay again for his already paid luggage. In the meantime no counter available and no representative of the company at Thessaloniki and Athens airports - only a malfunctioning call center. A trip supposed to last 6 hours (including layover), lasted well over 22 hrs.

### "I do not recommend Air Serbia"
Not Verified |  The worst airline ever. The flights are delayed and they have no idea what’s happening in their operation. My father had to wait 7hours due to delayed plane that had technical issues on 24th December. He missed his connection flight after that from Belgrade with other airline and they did not care to do anything no empathy whatsoever. I do not recommend Air Serbia.

### "Outrageous and disrespectful."
Not Verified | My family and I, two adults, a toddler, and a baby, travelled back to Oslo from Athens on September 25th. We got to the airport in Oslo in the evening and just grabbed our luggage in a hurry with two young children and went home. When we arrived home and I was going to open the suitcases, I found that one of the suitcases was broken, in the sense that it’s no longer possible to use (don’t know the name of those things that hold the suitcase together on the back, but one of them was broken, so the suitcase is not possible to close). I went on Air Serbia’s website to submit a damage claim, but since I did not have a damage report from the airport, it was not possible as that was a mandatory step. I called Air Serbia, and they told me to send an email to them. I did. It took several days before they replied, completely ignoring what I had written, and told me to use the form on their website to file a claim. I explained again that I cannot do that without a damage report. I didn’t hear from them for a long time, and I decided to call again. They told me to resend the email. I did. Then a day later, they replied again that I must use the form on their website. I explained again that I cannot, and I asked them kindly to read my email. Then, several days later, today, November 15th, they emailed back telling me they cannot find a damage report, so therefore they have closed the case! They couldn’t find the damage report I do not have. Should I cry or laugh, I don’t know. My suitcase cost me 5000 NOK. Air Serbia are responsible for breaking it, and they are completely fine with doing so. Outrageous and disrespectful. I do not recommend this company to anyone!

### "Never again!"
Oslo to Belgrade delay 2 hours without information. Belgrade to Athens : on time. boarding for both sectors chaotic. 2 check-in bags delayed for 7 days, 1 bag totalled (hardcase cracked near wheel). Claim filed with air serbia without response. Total compensation paid by air serbia: 0. Never again!

### "Overall great flight"
This was a very good flight. The seats were pretty good and the recline was average. The sandwiches  were good. The crew were friendly and polite. The lavatories smelled like urine and looked dirty. There were no air fresheners in the lavatories, so the smell couldn’t be fixed. Overall great flight, crew and the food. The only bad thing: the smell of the lavatories.

### "worst flight of my life"
This was one of the worst flights of my life. This flight was operated by GetJet Airlines, which is possibly the worst charter airline in the world! When we got in to the plane, the smell of vomit was in the air. The whole aircraft was dirty, like it was never cleaned before! The seat belts had some weird stains, which I guess were from the vomit. The seats were worse than Air Serbia’s product and the sandwich they gave me was very bland and dry! The crew were good, friendly and spoke good English. Overall, worst flight of my life!

### "no WiFi onboard"
The food was ok and the crew were very nice. The drinks were good and the seat reclines into a full-flat bed. There are blankets and pillows provided. You also get an amenity kit. The lavatories were ok, nothing special. There is no WiFi onboard. Food could’ve been better.

### "very friendly and professional"
The plane was modern and the cabin very clean and appealing. The crew was very friendly and professional. Fast check in and at Belgrade Airport the suitcases arrived very fast.

### “Very poor experience”
I tried a few times to buy ticket from Belgrade to Tivat and vice versa using Air Serbia online. Not one time I succeeded. After lengthy filling of details, passport numbers and what not I would be sent to a payment page. Then filling all the credit card details and then long wait without result. Just info do not close your page. After 5, 10, 15 minutes nothing. Then I have to make an expensive call to Air Serbia to get info that they are aware that I tried to bye tickets. No info why it failed or how to fix it, Then I had to buy a much more expensive ticket from the phone operator, give them all the credit card details and what not. Only then it works. Unfortunately the airline has practical monopoly on flights from Belgrade to Tivat and it is difficult to avoid. Very poor experience.

### "the worst airline"
Air Serbia has proven to be the worst airline I've ever experienced, consistently displaying incompetence and unprofessionalism. It started with a delay — understandable, but then it disappeared, only to reappear, leaving me scrambling to update my pick-up service six times. Onboard, I was given a sandwich after confirming I’m vegetarian, only to discover it contained meat. When I raised this issue, one flight attendant laughed, and another dismissed it, showing a shocking lack of care. On another flight, there was a 30-minute delay, with passengers stuck in a 33-degree cabin before being shuffled back and forth without clear communication. No food, water, or proper updates were provided. The constant uncertainty left me unsure if my pick-up service could even accommodate me. Avoid Air Serbia if you value your time and sanity.

### "Very expensive for the service"
Unfortunately I fly very often with Air Serbia as they are the only company having most of direct flights from Serbia. Flight was cancelled after 7 hours of waiting, no refund, neither for flight nor for other expenses like taxi, food and parking ticket. Very often long delays. Once I had to miss my ongoing flight and I did not have right to use return flight so I had to pay that day for the new ticket. I had admission to hospital and they did not want to refund me the ticket. Very unprofessional and unkind customer service staff in Belgrade, I needed help few times and never got it. No flexibility, with light ticket you have no rights at all and usual price is between 200-600€ for European return flights. Very expensive for the service they provide.

### "satisfied with the solution"
I was flying from Paris to Budapest and by technical reasons the second flight from Belgrade to Budapest was cancelled. I had to readjust my trip with my friends (they were waiting for the in Hungary). That led to additional expenses. I asked Air Serbia for a refund of 400 euros (I've spend around 325€ because of this inconvenience) and they just gave it to me without much trouble and in short terms. I understand that technical problems can occur, but the question was how you solve them. I was satisfied with the solution which made my trip pleasant, despite the flight cancellation.

### "unacceptable and unprofessional experience"
I recently had a deeply frustrating and stressful experience with Air Serbia that I feel compelled to share. On April 11, I bought a direct flight ticket from Belgrade to Saint Petersburg for my mother-in-law. I specifically chose a direct flight, despite the higher cost, to avoid the inconvenience of connections. Additionally, I paid for a reserved window seat. We checked in 24 hours before the flight, thinking everything was in order. However, when my mother-in-law arrived at the gate, she was told that the flight was overbooked, and she would only be able to fly if someone else didn’t show up. After two hours of waiting, they confirmed she wouldn't be flying. This left her stranded in the sterile zone of the airport, completely unsure of what to do or where to go. It was 1 a.m., the airport was nearly empty, and no staff were available to assist her. Fortunately, another woman in the same situation helped her navigate back through border control to the terminal. I met her there, and we went to the Air Serbia representative. They offered her a flight 24 hours later with a 2-hour connection in Istanbul. Considering her age and slow mobility, this was an impractical solution. After much insistence, they finally offered a flight to Moscow the next day. This meant finding our own way from Moscow to Saint Petersburg, but it was a more feasible option. To add insult to injury, we received no compensation for this entire ordeal, not even for the reserved window seat that I had paid for. This entire experience caused immense stress and frustration for my mother-in-law and me. The lack of communication, poor service, and inadequate handling of the situation by Air Serbia were appalling. I will avoid flying with Air Serbia in the future and would not recommend them to anyone. This was an absolutely unacceptable and unprofessional experience.

### "Worst flying experience ever"
Worst flying experience ever. 40 min flight was over two hours late. No apology or explanation offered, no staff at airport to advise. Missed onward connection and stranded in Belgrade for the night. The staff there were rude, uncaring, disorganised and aggressive. Couldn’t quite believe how awful it all was. Will never fly with them again. If I could give zero stars, I would.

### "the worst customer service"
It was the worst customer service I have ever experienced. They canceled my flight without re-booking and sent a useless e-mail saying, "We are sorry. There are no refund, new booking options, or online options to resolve. The US contact number was just disabled, e-mail with my request was never replied (more than 3 weeks passed). It took several days calling to different countries contact centers to reach out to them. They ended up re-booking an earlier flight, which was operated by Turkish. Online check-in doesn't check in with Serbian, because they kicked my booking to Turkish. It doesn't work with Turkish either because it's not their reservation. Avoid, avoid, avoid. They don't resolve customers' issues.

### "not received refund yet"
In January my flight was canceled after more then 7 hours waiting. I have not received refund yet. I also had problem now with my flight which the company as always is not interested in resolving. Unprofessional land staff, unpleasant.

### "had a very bad experience"
Not Verified |  We had a very bad experience with Lost baggage. We were travelling from Cyprus to Barcelona through Belgrade and they lost our baggage. Our bags had clothes and skis that were intended for our kids races in Andorra. Nobody was answering the telephone and there was no way to get in contact with them. We were very frustrated because they were going to miss the races. We found a WhatsApp number who answered to our messages and it turned out to be scammers that we were trying to charge us $100 for information on how to get our bags back. We ended up driving 8 hours to the airport of Barcelona and back from Andorra, where we found our bags without being even being called the following day. This was a connected flight and they did not bother to transfer our bags from one plane to the other. Needless to say our kids lost the first day of races in Andorra and were disappointed. Will never travel again with this company.

### "Worst experience!"
Worst experience! Air Serbia managed to lose our luggage and we were left in the blue for several days about the whereabouts and when we will get our luggage. Other passengers from different flights had to experience the same. We stated a claim on their website within the legal limit (in November 2023) for our expenses and haven’t heard anything back. Custom Service does not reply, Social Media is only making excuses. Never again with Air Serbia.

### "no one knew what's going on"
Not Verified |  Had no choice but to fly this on a last minute. Literally no one knew what's going on from the ground crew. Changing gates. Pretending to call a supervisor but then making up excuses.

### “We were hungry whole flight”
My girlfriend and I bought extra leg room tickets from Belgrade to New York with Air Serbia. We were in the middle row with 4 seats, nobody was seated next to us. From 4 seats not one of the seats had a functioning entertainment system so we were doomed to stare at the wall for 10 hours. Horrible service as well, we were offered a piece of grilled cheese with some vegetables once we started flying and a sandwich an hour before we was about to land. We were hungry whole flight. Not to mention only while serving the food we were offered drinks. Drinks were poured from the bottles instead of standard cans. Oh and no wifi during the flight lol. Don't fly with Air Serbia unless you have to.

### “denied boarding for my dog”
Not Verified | On Monday I was supposed to have a flight from Porto to Belgrade with my dog. I paid for my ticket and additional cost for my dog. Then Air Serbia denied boarding for my dog because he couldn’t spin in the bag. I have to say that I travel all the time with my dog with many other bigger airlines than Air Serbia and we never had a problem until now. So, if you want to travel with them with your pet please DON’T! Height of maximal dimension for bag is 24 cm and I don’t know which dog is smaller then 24 cm when he is standing?! Maybe Chihuahua?! I must say that flight was delayed for 5 hours like many others flights operated by this horrible company, this is obviously common for Air Serbia. I stayed on airport in Porto and didn’t went to my home and family for Christmas because of course I didn’t want to leave my dog. Now they don’t want to give me money refund neither for ticket neither for my dog.

### "Despicable customer service"
I booked an Air Serbia flight with a two hour transit. As I arrive at the gate, I learn the flight is delayed by more than 2 hours. The exact delay is unknown. I am given a 10€ voucher and a Belgian number which is out of service. I am then given a Serbian number which I call several times before getting someone on the phone. This person asks me questions then tells me to wait, never to return again! I hang up after 5 costly minutes and call one last time unsuccessfully before giving up. Will ask for a refund which (from the comments I read) I fear I might never get. I probably missed my flight to Greece. I doubt Air Serbia cares at all. Despicable customer service. Avoid at all cost.

### "do not recommend it to anyone"
We planned a flight Kazan-Belgrade-Bologna on August 9. The airline canceled the flight after passing through security and checking in luggage. We traveled with a baby - a family of 4 people. The flight was simply canceled due to a breakdown of the plane, which had to be landed in Moscow instead of Kazan. A replacement flight was offered only for the next day with another airline and we arrived at the place more than a day later. Our travel plans were disrupted, and we were not refunded the money for our hotel reservations. The most terrible travel experience of my entire life. We are entitled to compensation. We submitted a request for compensation on August 10 (number 22160). After that, I called and wrote several times, they feed me promises to consider the application, but they do not promise a time frame. Despite the convenience of docking, I no longer use the services of this company and do not recommend it to anyone.

### "requested a refund"
Not Verified |   I booked my flight in the middle of June with Air Serbia. After they cancelled my flight from Larnaca to Malaga due to airline’s unknown reason i requested a refund from the airline. I called them and told them that i want to get a refund on my flight and the card i paid was lost and cancelled. The woman didn’t seem to be fluent in English ,so the communication was hard. I called them again after one week asking how is the process going and if they need anything else from me. They sent me a new form that i had to write all the details of the lost card and the card’s details that they refund money will get it. Is been two months that I didn’t hear anything from the airline.

### "31 days since the refund request was made"
I faced a very poor and passive service from Air Serbia when they cancelled their flight from Israel. As soon as the flight was cancelled I requested a refund via ticket provider. Ticket provider said that they have send request to Air Serbia and they can "check" it within a month or more. Usually all comanies do it within 10 days. I had same experience with Aegean airlines on route from Belgrade to Tel-aviv and they returned me money in 5-7 days. So im pretty sure that the problem is not on the side of ticket provider. After waiting for more then 20 days i decided to write directly to Air Serbia via contact form on the site. I provided all ticket information and asked for the status of refund and asked for speeding up the refund if possible. All i got is a kind of automatic answer like "go to your ticket provider, we have no information" and i got this answer after 3 days of waiting. After that I wrote another message to get information about their policy in terms of time for refund. No answer in more than a week yet. Today is 31 days since the refund request was made and my ticket provider just wrote that Air Serbia confirmed the refund. So the picture is quite obvious to me. This company will hold your money as far as they could by their contract with ticket providers till the last day. They don't care that client could need that money for another ticket or just to his own purposes. This is so tacky..

### "helpful, friendly and professional"
From the moment staff helped me and my luggage at check in, to the services I received from the Premium Lounge; and through my flight, every person has been helpful, friendly and professional. Thanks to the stewardesses & stewards on my flight for their friendly behavior, warm smiles, patience, hospitality and comfortable atmosphere they provided. Thank you: Ana, Luka, Dejan, Stefan (I apologize if I forgot anyone). I particularly thank Dejan for offering me a seat in a quieter area of the plane, when he could tell I was not comfortable in my seat where there was much noise.

### "the most disorganised airline"
Pathetic. If you're looking for the most disorganised airline in the world - look no further One hour late so far & still dragging their feet. Going from gate to gate, not knowing what is happening. Don't waste your time and money

### "recommend Air Serbia"
Not Verified |  Airline was on time, seats clean and comfortable for the short flights, Cabin crew offer sweets and water for free and alcohol for a charge which was okay and good price. Cabin crew fluent in English, smiling and friendly. Feel very welcomed and flights were on time. Transfer was well organised on arrival,. Overall Air Serbia is excellent and can recommend Air Serbia.

### "Absolutely appalling behaviour"
Not Verified |  Flight was delayed by more than 3 hours which caused us to miss a connecting flight. They did not give us any compensation which is required under EU Regulation 261. Also, my travel insurance claim required a reason for the delay (e.g. bad weather) however Air Serbia refused to state the reason why the delay occurred so I can't make a claim to my Travel Insurance company for the new flight I had to buy due to them making me miss my connecting flight. Absolutely appalling behaviour. Don't care about their customers at all. Don't fly with them.

### "the seat recline was broken"
Flight speaker was broken and made very loud sounds. Also, the seat recline was broken. I received a cookie and a water. The crew was very polite. I had a short delay but it went well.

### “no one is responsible for anything”
Worst airline I've ever flown with. The airline lost our luggage at the transfer airport in Belgrade. The airline's home airport in Belgrade was technically faulty. Our boarding passes were written out in pen. Our flight was delayed by 3 hours. We spent all this time in a stuffy plane, where it was quite hot. Moreover, upon arrival in Barcelona, we discovered that both of our suitcases were lost. Immediately after the discovery of the loss, the relevant documents were drawn up. 7 months have passed and no one has found our luggage. During this time I sent the company over 100 emails, over 50 international calls (for which I paid roaming rates). I spent a lot of time, nerves, energy, and also lost a lot of things, including sentimental ones (which I can no longer recover). My trip was ruined because we had to look for new clothes and essentials after arriving. I also lost my DSLR camera (which was also expensive), so I couldn’t capture my train ride in good quality. The worst airline ever, no one is responsible for anything. I will never use this airline and do not recommend it to others.

### "no recline on my seat"
There was no recline on my seat and there wasn’t a seat pocket. One member of the cabin crew was very unpleasant during boarding and during the flight. Also, while the passengers were disembarking, including me, the crew didn’t say goodbye. One member of the crew was very rude when serving the refreshment. Finally, at the end of the flight, when there was a final announcement, the speaker malfunctioned and the sound of the announcement overlapped an other announcement. Apart from this, the flight was good.

### "We were impressed with our flight"
We were impressed with our flight with Air Serbia on July 17th, 2023 at 01:50 pm from New York to Belgrade. The warm and welcoming service from the Air Serbia staff set the tone for our journey. The cabin crew's attentiveness made the flight even more comfortable. The fact that we arrived in Belgrade early was a pleasant surprise, and the pilot's great personality and informative updates throughout the flight were greatly appreciated. We look forward to flying with them again. Thank you, Air Serbia! (I’ve read some negative reviews since our flight and even though our experience was amazing; Air Serbia please listen to your customers and improve where improvement is needed).

### "doesn’t do anything for their clients"
Air Serbia lost my luggage and they do not respond to my emails. When I call them they don’t even have department where they can track lost luggage. Representative over the phone told me to call airport in Belgrade or London for missing luggage. After multiple calls Belgrade airport doesn't even answer calls and LHR told me that for lost check in luggage I have to contact Air Serbia. This company doesn’t do anything for their clients, staff is not trained well and reimbursement amount that they offer for lost lost luggage is not enough to cover half of what I had in suitcase.

### "Delightful flight"
Not Verified |  Delightful flight and exceptional service. Flight was smooth; aircrew announcements at minimum. Two stewards stand out for individual mention: Tiana and Peter. Both spoke genially and informatively about what to expect at destination; both showed masterful command of English. I'd recommend crew and airline without reservation.

### "never travel again with Air Serbia"
They constantly changed dates of flights with no notice. My flight was rescheduled from August 23 to August 25. Then it was rescheduled from August 25 to August 27, and again to August 28. Because I could not accept to travel on August 28, I accepted to fly on August 27 from Belgrade to Buffalo, USA instead to Toronto, rent a car in Buffalo and drive to Toronto. The whole trip was 30 hours long and was delayed for five days from my original date. When I returned to Toronto, I wanted to submit a complaint, but the Air Serbia server did not work. I would never travel again with Air Serbia. Unprofessional, rude, incompetent, and dishonest staff.

### "experience was good"
The experience was good. The delays were minor (15-30'), the boarding went in smoothly and the staff was professional and smiley! For the amount of money I gave, the overall experience was better than I imagined.

### "won’t recommend it to anyone"
I was travelling from Berlin to Cairo and will land in Belgrade as transit for 55 min and the flight in Berlin was late by ONE HOUR! When I called the call center they were totally USELESS and IRRESPONSIBLE she said always "how can I help you, I don't have any information in the system“. I will NEVER ever book with this NONRESPECFUL company again and won’t recommend it to anyone. Take care guys because people in Berlin just knew that this company always late so it was fine with them.

### "non-smiling flight attendants"
Unfortunately I have to give Air Serbia this sad review. Had nothing but issues on my flight to Chicago from Belgrade. Air Serbia was late leaving Belgrade to Chicago, so we missed our connecting flight to Orlando FL. When asked what are we going to do now they sent us to Air Serbia booth to ask to be put on different flight. However, Air Serbia closes their check-in at 12.30 pm so they were long gone by the time we got there. After calling them for 20 min finally got someone on the phone who basically was useless and told us they can't really help us much and I need to un-check in from this flight we missed! So other employees at the airport were telling us we are screwed. Air Serbia was huge disappointment. From some, unpleasant, non-smiling flight attendants that didn't check on you occasionally, offer coffee or water, speeding down aisle, not picking up your trash. No power on a plane and devices not working, 10 hours in the air with no working devices or ability to charge phones. Only kudos we can send is to the pilots- thank you for very smooth and safe flight. Probably the best pilots out there fly Air Serbia planes. So, after flying over 10000 miles across the world and back and to Miami and back and not sleeping for 32 hours, we are finally back home. Traveling with 2 yo, this was exhausting.

### “No explanations given”
Worst flight ever. Late departure, missed the connecting flight. We got tickets for the next day and they put us in a horrible Hotel. No explanations given. I will never fly again with this company

### "please avoid this company"
I was flying with two young kids to a holiday destination and had my connecting flight in Belgrade. We almost didn't make it cause the flight was delayed. Of course I suspected that our luggage wouldn't make it and it didn't. Since we on vacation I had everything in the checked in luggage. For three days I was calling and emailing the airport in Belgrade without any information. Finally the luggage was delivered to us three days later. In the meanwhile I had to buy the most basic things for my kids and my self. Now trying to get compensation for that is a process I'm still in. I have been writing to 4 different mails that I found on their website before finally being redirected to the complaint site (which btw they do not provide on their website). But when you put all the details, attach the tickets, receipts the page has an error and the complaint can not be sent. It is obvious that this is set up so people can't even put in a complaint so that they don't have to pay. So please avoid this company.

### “ Communication has been extremely poor”
Horrible experience. Our first flight was 2hrs late, we managed to get the connecting flight in Belgrade but our luggages (and the ones of all other passengers) didn’t made it. Communication has been extremely poor: we know that the luggages were found and given to a courier, but no one knows anything on where they currently are or when we will receive them. We have been waiting for 4 days now, I have 3 young kids and no clothes (as we are on holiday). I understand luggages may be late, but leaving people stranded with no communication at all is outrageous.

### "worst we ever encountered"
We had four flights with Air Serbia. Third of them were delayed and we didn't make the fourth because of the delay. First of all the cabin crew is nice. It's just the really bad service of this airline. Because of delay we didn't make our flight to Amsterdam. When asking, they said they transfered us on 2 flights the next morning, 12 hours later. We didn't recieve any tickets only a voucher for a hotel for the night. When retrieving our baggages, they just didn't arrive. But we knew they were in Belgrade because of our Air Tags (thank god). After a LOT of demanding, whe recieved them. We were on our own without any support. We had to take a taxi, because the so prommised bus never arrived for the hotel. We arrived at 5pm and eventually arrived at the hotel at 9.30pm They don't answer emails, and the service at Belgrade is just comically terrible. Whe flew a lot, and this experience and service is the worst we ever encountered. Just please, for your emotional health, avoid at all cost.

### "wouldn't recommend flying with Air Serbia"
Not Verified |  First of all making clear that the flight experience itself was okay, other then the fact that we had a long delay on our first flight from Istanbul to Belgrade. They waited for all the passengers who transferred in Belgrade, which is a nice gesture. But the trouble started when we arrived. We waited for over an hour to get a message that our baggage was lost. We lost 3 pieces of luggage in total. It all started with the fact that the company was unable to properly find our bags. 3-5 days", they said at the airport. We called at the number they gave us, no one picked up. We called Air Serbia, to complain and ask where possibly our luggage was. The woman on the phone told us to "stop making it an issue". We eventually got 2 out of 3 pieces of luggage back. One was broken into by border patrol in Serbia (sticker was on the side of the suitcase confirming it). They removed hair spray and pliers? Even though, it was possible to open the suitcase with a TSA key, they still used pliers to break into it, thus breaking the zipper of the suitcase. We still haven't received our third piece of luggage and its been almost 7 days. Overall, I wouldn't recommend flying with Air Serbia, or Belgrade especially if you want to use pliers or hairspray.

### "4/4 flights heavily delayed"
Not Verified | Impressively bad. 4/4 flights heavily delayed, too little time between transfers (within own airline in Belgrade airport) causing stress, very little information available, and to top it off they lost our baggage during transfer, along with another 20 people on the same journey. But what's worse, I spoke with an employee at Schiphol airport and he said it is a daily occurrence that Air Serbia planes arrive with easily over 30 missing check-in items. They mentioned they simply don't know what's going on in Serbia or how it can be this bad. I will never fly with these people again and will avoid Belgrade airport forever. The crew was nice by the way, the problem really is policy and a badly managed airport.

### "Worst airline experience ever"
After the booking website reloaded multiple times while in Serbia I ended up booking the wrong dates for travel, my error and full responsibility taken. On the day I thought flights were booked we added extras like fast track priority and lounge access through air Serbia website. When we arrived we realised our flights were booked for the upcoming month of September not August, we were instructed to go to customer service and we would pay a fee to amend bookings, once there I was told no amendments could be made little to no refund would be given for ancillaries or tickets and new tickets must be purchased to fly on the day fair enough. But in the end we were charged $1400+ euros and were given no extras or any consolations. I cannot stress how bad this airlines customer service is if there is any issue at all. If I had not booked hotels and cruises in Greece and understood the amount I was paying at the counter at the time I would never have agreed to the extra costs. Once processed and checked the total amount I asked if I could cancel and or change my flights for a refund and was flatly told no chance. Worst airline experience ever and I fly around the world a lot for work, so I thought I had seen it all until now.

### "had to reschedule everything"
Not Verified | Very very bad experience with this airline. Our first flight with Air Serbia arrived way too late because it waited for a connected flight. They promised our connected flight will wait as well, but it did not. We had a delay of more than 12 hours and still counting. Very unreliable. Also the staff is not being very helpful. Only one girl has been trying to arrange something. All other people have little to no information and they do not even let you tell your story. We looked up the histroy of the last few days and all flughts are always delayed. Do not go with Air Serbia, only if you have nothing booked on your trip and you are more flexible. We now had to reschedule everything.

### "This airline is horrible"
This airline is horrible. They had some late passengers (not hard to believe if those passengers were connecting from other Air Serbia flights). Rather than just compensating those people they just held up the whole flight. I'm currently still sitting in an uncomfortable airport bus waiting as I write this. No sign well leave soon. It's been 50 minutes since I got on the bus, and it's been 25 minutes since our flight was supposed to have left. They haven't even made an effort to communicate about this. Inexcusable. Do not fly with them.

### "would not recommend"
I had a booking in business class, but the aircaft was only equipped with economy. I was advised to request the refund for the price difference via the customer service department. I did so, but never received any response or refund. The agents on the phone are rude and unhelpful. I would not recommend using this airline service!

### "customer care not a priority"
I understand delays happen with weather conditions and we would all prefer o travel safely. During the 21 hour delay most of this time at the connecting airport in Belgrade, information and customer care was not a priority. We eventually got back to London via another airline that Air Serbia sorted. However my online bag is somewhere en route and I, not anyone at air Serbia can help me with this issue. I feel devastated that many of my personal belongings will be lost forever and I am very sad that my trust in the company to take of my travel does not seem to be important.

### "employees are extremely rude"
Not Verified | Worst airline company I have ever traveled with. Staff is extremely unprofessional, not helpful, they just don’t care. Our first flight from Lisbon to Serbia was delayed and then the connection flight to Tirana was simply cancelled without an explanation from anyone. Air Serbia staff as well as the airport employees are extremely rude. Just never travel with this company, you won’t regret it.

### "caused me so much inconvenience"
Very unprofessional and uncaring about being late from the very start! Today, they were 3 hours late in Belgrade, which caused me to miss my connecting flight to Chicago from New York. This problem caused me to be on a stand-by for another 20 hours! I am here now sleeping on airport chairs in Miami because I had to fly to Miami to make that connecting flight to Chicago. This is not a first time they are late. When I traveled from Chicago to Belgrade on June 26, 2023, they were 2 hours late. Very unprofessional, and also expensive for the bad service. If they continue doing such a bad job, they’ll lose the business! I am also asking for my money back! They have caused me so much inconvenience and pain. They don’t care really.

### "the flight was overbooked"
Not Verified | I was leaving Madrid, going to Larnaca with a stop in Belgrade with Air Serbia. But I was denied boarding at Madrid airport, because the flight was overbooked. I had to stay at the airport for 4 hours until I could find out more from another company who were operating on behalf of air Serbia, because it does not have offices in the Barajas airport (Madrid), about the subsequent flights to my final destination of Larnaca. In the end, they booked me a flight for the early morning of the next day and forced me to spend a night at the airport, because getting back to the city and again back to the airport would have been difficult since there was no transportation at those hours. I had complained on the company's website and emailed them for a refund of the amount of the tickets I had purchased but they never replied and never informed me of anything more. Worst company ever! Now, whenever I want to flight I never book with Air Serbia. I prefer book a ticket with a lower budget air company than spend AGAIN my money in this airline. If there was an option I would rate it with 0.

### "never consider flying Air Serbia again"
The company is out of any control. We booked a flight to match our schedule, only to be informed on short notice that we were rescheduled to a flight leaving at 4:20 a.m., meaning that we need to be at the airport at 3:00 a.m. My past experience with this airline company tells me that the worst mistake I can do is taking the 'offer', which is a bad joke. So only solution is to book an entirely new flight, beg for reimbursement, and never ever consider flying Air Serbia again. I guess it is evident to anyone who flew with them, that days are over and this airline is destined for bankruptcy in no time. What an utter shame to an otherwise aspiring country that we hope to see joining the European Union soon.

### "Air Serbia is a disaster"
We booked flights for our vacation trip only to be informed that our flights are rescheduled by a day and half earlier to the middle of the night with an arrival at 3:00 a.m. Our friends got a different flight, still rescheduled, but at a civilized time. Customer service was incapable of doing anything. I eventually mailed the CEO and minutes later we received the same flights as our friends. Of course, no words of apology, no compensation (extra hotel night) or anything. Check-in was a nerve-wrecking wait of 90 min, a blast from last century, with three overwhelmed agents trying to handle every single ticket, as online check-in is not available. Flights were delayed, the first one done by a charter airline. In total, nothing worked. Now we learned that our return flights are rescheduled as well to a 4:00 a.m. departure. Air Serbia is a disaster.

### "they lost my 2 luggages"
Terrible experience, they lost my 2 luggages. Customer service total disaster, lack of professionalism, is very hard to get in touch with them and if you do them answer is "we don't know". I just transit Bulgaria to visit the country, now I am stuck here and I lost all my reservations for my next trip with no clothes for change. So please be careful and don't choose this airline.

### "her seat was sold to another passenger"
My daughter who is 17 years old, and disabled had her flight scheduled from Belgrade to London this morning. She was provided her boarding pass, and she checked in her luggage . While waiting in the line to board the plane, her name was called, and Air Serbia staffer told her that her seat was sold to another passenger? Staff was very rude and did not help her at all. She was never provided with new flight times, or given an explanation on how she will get home to America ? She has 4 days of chemo therapy left with her , and needed to come home ASAP. She was crying so hard, and not one staff member wanted to help her. So here I am today trying to contact the agency that sold us tickets to arrange for new flight as she lost her connecting flight from London to America.

### "They lost our luggage in Belgrade"
Not Verified |  Worst airline ever! They lost our luggage in Belgrade and it is impossible to reach anybody. We called 20 different numbers all day and no one ever picks up the phone. We knew someone in Belgrade who went to the airport and even that was useless. Nobody had a clue, and nobody cared. Everybody was rude and aggressive. It is complete chaos, this company is going down the drain. Avoid them at all cost. Avoid also Belgrade airport as a stop over, the ground operations are totally disorganised.

### "Staff were rude and not helpful"
Not Verified |  Worst airline. Our flight from Athens to Belgrade with air Serbia was delayed 2 hours. Missed our connecting flight from Belgrade to Budapest by 15 minutes. Had to wait 5hrs at the airport until we got a voucher for a hotel (this was at 11pm). Once we got our vouchers we were told to wait again for a bus. Staff were rude and not helpful at all. We understand that it is no fault of their own but an apology would be nice. Although the lady that did rebook our flights was nice enough. I will never book with this airline again.

### "lost our luggage in connecting flight"
Air Serbia is not a functional airline in terms of lost luggage and customer service care, they are too far from taking care of their customers. They lost our luggage in connecting flight, and there is no phone number to call checking your lost luggage. There is a tracing luggage site which hives you permanently statement, "Tracing continue, check your status later" All our clothes is lost and we are stuck here with no clothes on our vacation. In Tivat airport is extremely low technical and computer equipped airport, no real serviced of lost luggage claim.

### "Horrible experience!"
Horrible experience! During my connection from Lyon to Tirana on June 30th, my luggage has been lost like a thousand ones. I have been travelling for 10 days in Albania without any belongings. I was obliged to buy minimal stuff just to be clean and try to enjoy my trip. I have tried to contact tens of times Lost & found offices in Tirana and Belgrade by phone, by email without any luck nor information. Now I have been back in France for 6 days and I still don't have any news.

### "They failed on every service offered"
Booked a flight from Bucharest to Barcelona via Belgrade and return as to avoid the low cost carriers. The first flight from Bucharest to Belgrade arrived late and departed with 2 hours delay. The flight from Belgrade to Barcelona was still at the gate but the staff bluntly told us that we missed our flight and we must contact the carrier for a new flight. The 2 luggage's were not presented at the luggage belt, we waited for 2 hours as mountains of luggage were pilled all over the place. In our condition were more than 200 passengers all stranded in Belgrade. They booked us to the next flight in the morning and lied that the baggage will come along in the new flight. They didn't and they are after 2.5 weeks not found! We had to sleep in the airport as no hotel was provided in time. The return flight had also 3 2+ hours delay and should have to arrive in Belgrade past our connection to Bucharest. As we arrived in Belgrade the connection flight was still there with no boarding started. As in Barcelona we received only the boarding passes to Belgrade, they instructed us to go to the transit desk and receive our passes. After 2+ hours we didn't received our passes and the plane flew without us. The staff are impolite and lie all the time or routing you to the next incompetent person. They failed on every service offered and do not respond to emails. Will never fly again this company or Etihad for having such partners and avoid all stops in Belgrade.

### "no longer respond to my emails"
I wanted to change the date on my business class travel to Oslo. I called and they told me it's not possible, but they will give me full refund. They asked me to fill the bank information where I want my money. I never received nothing. Either they no longer respond to my emails. The telephone number for customer service it seems unreachable or thy just blocked me just like that. I have tried like 40 times to call them

### "Bags were lost"
Not a single flight has been on time. Always a minimum 1hr delay. Bags were lost, returned after many days, nightmare when on holiday.

### "worst airline I’ve travelled with"
Not Verified | I received an email on the 3rd of July from Air Serbia informing me that my scheduled flight which was on the 6th of July at 20:35 was rescheduled 9 hours earlier than the initial time. I have emailed the company and called several times but I had no response. The company did not offer me a refund or compensation, in order to buy another ticket. I had no other choice but to take the changed flight the company decided for me. In result, I had to cancel my arranged work scheduled meetings in Karlovy Vary. Moreover this morning my flight was meant to depart at 09:35 from Prague, but they were delayed and made us go through unnecessary waiting in the bus. When we finally arrived in Larnaca a while ago, my partner’s luggage (along with several other luggage from passengers in the plane) never arrived to Cyprus, because they were forgotten behind in Belgrade. This is by far the worst airline I’ve travelled with.

### "No reaction on my complaint"
There was overbooking for about 8 passengers on my flight. The next scheduled flight I was offered is after twelve hours at late night. No reaction on my complaint for months since this time.

### "worst company I ever used"
This is the worst company I ever used. The first plane was late and we still arrived on time for a second plane but they didn't let us in even if the plane was still here and not closed. Then we waited 2 hours to get tickets for the morning after where the crew arrived after the supposed departure time and we had more than 1h delay. Worst company ever and worst sales teams. This is not a professional company and it should not sell ticket if they are not able to fly on time.

### "Delayed flights, lost luggage"
Delayed flights, lost luggage. and when they located it, they said I WOULD HAVE TO GO BACK TO THE AIRPORT TO PICK IT UP!! They don't even send it. NEVER AGAIN!

### "Worst airline ever"
Worst airline ever. They lie about special offers. They delayed our return flight for 24h and we got just some generic message. No explanation, nothing. They left us with our 3 year old child and when we complained that we don't have any more accommodation they didn't care. Never again with them.

### "less than helpful gate staff"
Plane arrived in Rome one hour late because of a delay in getting fuel to the aircraft. It sat at the gate for over an hour until the petroleum truck arrived. Very little, if any, communication from the less than helpful gate staff to the passengers regarding status or reason. Mostly, they did not face the terminal and even disappeared or hid behind the desk. Pilot neither acknowledged nor apologized for the delay. The digital display board was never updated to show the delay. Boarding pass had 4 zones for boarding which were absolutely unenforced except they allowed families with children & disabled on first. They couldn’t even complete the a la carte food service for economy passengers. 4.Electronics must be turned off for takeoff & landing? Also a notice that you can’t take photos of other passengers. No WiFi on planes.

### "assertive, arrogant and aggressive"
The panel above passenger's head was broken and 'fixed' with tape. Cabin crew are very young female staff, who were assertive, arrogant and aggressive.

### "the worst airline ever"
This is the worst airline ever, only with this airline I had such a terrible experience. I purchased my ticket on an official Air Serbia website and paid extra for the seat which is displayed on the attached ticket (3A). The boarding starts, and they start from the last row going forward. So I board among the last, and at the boarding they said they changed my seat from 3A to 30C which is the last row of the plane near the bathroom. They don’t even know the reason, that’s how good that are. My advice to everyone - don’t fly with Air Serbia- no customer service at all. And if you fly - don’t pay extra for any of their services, since as it turns out nothing what you paid for is guaranteed.

### "I absolutely do not recommend"
They lost my luggage. They are giving me no updates. Cannot reach out to them in anyway. Also very rude staff very unprofessional. I absolutely do not recommend.

### "serve a complimentary meal"
Full plane, the stewardesses were efficient, professional. They serve passengers a complimentary meal on a 3:30 flight which  is commendable. Spacious on emergency exit. Also bought a bigger chicken sandwich for 4.5 €, think it was worthwile on European flight.

### "Air Connect crew was pleasant"
I can't give a full score because there was a 45 minute delay. The flight was operated by another company called Air Connect and its crew was pleasant and the plane clean and modern.

### "Never again"
Not Verified |  Due to bad weather in New York at least 30 passengers got delayed. Air Serbia did not find appropriate to have their desk opened at least 15 minutes later to allow us all to board the plane. Worst of all we printed their boarding passes at home and when we showed them to security at JFK they were not valid, what a joke. Never again. So many nice airlines around and I am trying to use Air Serbia just from patriotic reasons. They do not deserve to even consider them as an option.

### "never again fly with Air Serbia"
The worst airline ever. 3 hours delayed flight without any update information, no information at the airport about flight status. Call center barely reached, but I’ve been charged 10k isk for a call, with waiting over an hour! In addition agent who I’ve talked with was so rude and unpleasant! Shame for Serbia, never again fly with Air Serbia.

### "tickets are not changed even with a fee"
You have to wait at least 40 to 50mins to communicate with Air Serbia. And when you are lucky and that happens you can't communicate unless you speak Serbian. They don't speak English at all. Their tickets are not changed even with a fee.

### "trying to get the money back"
I paid for 2 extra suitcases online and was charged again at the airport. My mum has been trying to get the money back for the past 2 weeks. No email has been responded to, she spend 30 EUR on calls just to be told you will receive an email and the refund. Nothing  happened.

### "I asked for a refund"
We bought two tickets to fly from Tirana to Stockholm, via Belgrade, the 15th October 2022, with Air Serbia. The flight number was JU217 and its departure was at 4:30 am. The flight was cancelled and nobody noticed us, we first knew about the cancellation when we arrived at the airport. Air Serbia didn't provide us an alternative flight, a hotel or meal: they just said that the next flight would be 37 hours later. Anyhow the guy there only mention that flight, never ask us if we wanted to take that. We couldn't anyhow have waited that much because we had another flight the same day from Stockholm to Buenos Aires. So, we bought immediately another flight at Lufthansa, which did departed at 8:30. I asked for a refund from the company but the company answered that the flight was cancelled because of weather conditions, but Air Serbia was the only company which cancelled the flight.

### "my bid was not successful"
I made an offer to upgrade to business but received no email to inform me if my bid was successful or not. When I checked in it was confirmed my bid was not successful but I was given an emergency exit seat which is good. The flight was 2 hours and 20 minutes late and when I boarded I realised the plane was a type that has no business class at all. In my opinion there were too few bids for upgrade to business class so the airline decided to switch the plane to one without a business class despite it arriving two hours or so later. The plane itself was clean and onboard service was good.

### "$60 for being 2kg over"
I will never use this company again. I already gave them a free money for deciding to stay one more day and purchased another ticket for later day. They charged me for a tiny carry on $60 for being 2kg over. I wanted to take off some staff but the girl was rude and forced me to pay. I did not want to argue and paid. I am pretty sure karma will take care of that stewardess and the air company. I did lot recommend them to fly with them. They billed me almost $200 for 1 hour flight.

### "two out of three of my luggage arrived"
Not Verified |  In August we had a flight returning from Belgrade to JFK two out of three of my luggage arrived at JFK we filed a claim for the lost luggage. It’s almost 3 months later and there’s no luggage and there’s no response. You get an automated email response from them you cannot get a hold of a human, they basically ignore everything, they don’t want to take responsibility. I will never recommend them and I will never use them again.

### "airline seems to ignore everything"
Excessive delay of my baggage (>30 days). I went through the whole process and claims for my luggage in the airport, as well as in the airline's website. I have been trying to contact the airline ever since this incident happened and no one has responded to my phone calls, the customer base even hung up the phone multiple times after being on hold for more than 2. I have sent several emails and submitted tens of complaint forms and the airline seems to ignore everything.

### "staff tired, stern, no smiles"
Vienna to Belgrade. Never fly with Air Serbia, even if they give you free ticket. We flew to Belgrade on Air Serbia flight JU601 on Sep 11. Flight attendants looked as if they had number of sleepless nights prior to this flight. Tired, stern, no smiles. Extremely cold air blew onto us. There was no way for us to adjust the flow. when I asked if something can be done, I just got unpleasant stare, and not a single word. Still have pain in my ear after two days. Upon arrival, we realized that our bags were missing. Filed a claim immediately. Staff at the Baggage claim were unprofessional and disorganized. The following was the answer to my question about contacting someone at the call center number provided on the claim form : “You can try, but nobody has answered on that line in the last several months’. How is this possible? Yes, it is. After two days of trying, we are still to hear someone answer. We sent many emails as well, no replies, no acknowledgment. Went back to the airport morning of Sep 13, were informed that one of our bags will arrive on the evening flight from Vienna, JU605. Went to the airport again in the evening. We were told that our bag was probably not loaded onto flight. Probably? What does that mean? The baggage hall was full of delayed bags It looked very chaotic. We are losing hope that our bags will ever be found. In the chaos that is Belgrade airport is, anyone’s bag can easily be stolen. If you have any respect for yourself, for your time and money, do not fly on Air Serbia!

### "Absolutely avoid"
Bought a refundable ticket. Tried to get a refund for this ticket after my plans were changed. I was not even rejected for the refund with an excuse, I was completely ignored on all communication channels. Don't know what more to say. I had generally positive experiences with the company previously but this negates it all. Absolutely avoid.

### "unorganized and clearly understaffed"
Belgrade to New York. Had a return flight August 13 with my son from Belgrade to New York JFK. Upon arriving at JFK we waited what felt like forever for our luggage, unfortunately for me two of our luggage did not arrive, we filed a claim at JFK, I have yet to hear from anyone either from JFK or Air Serbia it’s 2 1/2 weeks later and I have no luggage nor have I heard back from anyone. I have sent hundreds and hundreds of emails to Air Serbia I’ve called the hundreds and hundreds of times however you cannot get a hold of anyone even if you wait an hour it automatically hangs up. Re: Air Serbia I find the airline extremely unprofessional, unorganized and clearly understaffed, because I can’t get a hold of anyone via email via phone any which way.

### "they delayed our flight"
When we were leaving Serbia they delayed our flight. I asked information desk and they said they had no information about the flight. I asked a person at the gate and she told me the plane was here and there were no issues. So after waiting we asked information and they said the plane was in the air and expected to arrive soon. So after waiting some more we asked information again and they said the plane was stuck in Turkey because of bad weather. I checked the weather radar in Turkey and there was no cloud over Turkey. The customers were getting irritated and the information lady said if anyone else asked that she would call the cops on everyone in line. Customer service does not exist in Air Serbia.

### "I was left with no assistance"
Their plane from Sochi to Belgrade was delayed (JU679 of Aug 8th, 2022) I couldn't catch a connection to Bologna because it was already gone (JU550 of Aug 8th, 2022) I was given another itinerary by their representative in Belgrade through Split and Vienna Their plane (JU252) to Split was delayed, I couldn't catch my connection to Vienna and then to Bologna I was left with no assistance at the Split airport, I tried to contact them by phone but nobody answered The day after I took a bus to Bologna at my own expense, not to mention that I had to sleep in the open air and I had to buy food for that day. I asked for a refund right away filling in all of their forms and after several days a machine is telling me that it will take time to peruse my request.

### "cancelled while we were driving to the airport"
The flight from Sarajevo to Zürich, over Belgrade (20.08.2022) was cancelled while we were in the taxi driving to the airport. There is no Air Serbia support on the airport. Airport Sarajevo stuff sent us to the hotel and we got phone number of Air Serbia support for Bosnia to deal with the new tickets. But it is impossible to get anyone on that phone number. We spent all mobile phone credit by waiting on the line. An hour later we just got a new tickets for 2 days later, without a chance to comment. No other option is offered. Meanwhile hotel is booked by the airport for only one night. We wrote to all publicly given addresses trying to reach out to someone in Air Serbia. All without success. So, basically, they are canceling the flight without telling the reason, sending new ticket without asking whether those 2 days make a difference in your life, without ensuring accomodation over a whole forced stay. Also flight to Sarajevo didn't go without troubles. Connecting flight was 4 hours delayed. Nobody explained why or apologized. We went to the service desk at the airport where we got sandwiches and bottle of water as compensation. When we finally got to the plane, my seat as well as seats of several people around were broken. I had to hold recliner by hand.

### "Crew were more making a joke about the situation"
Airplane was delayed for 4 hours, but first two hours nobody would announce anything and give some info why and for how long plane will be delayed. Then finally after more waiting we sat on the plane, while driving to the runway the pilot suddenly said there was an engine issue and we have to go back. We were sitting in 36 C degrees on the plane when finally they said we can go to the bus and sit with a/c. Plane was small and announcement was very loud (I am kind of deaf - but it was too loud for me). Crew were more making a joke about the situation than really trying to help and inform passengers. A plus was that they gave us a snack but everybody got different. I think some got aa toasted sandwich, but some got a small bottle of water, some candy etc. Apparently whatever was left from the previous flight.

### "an additional 60 eur for checked in luggage"
Round ticket booked through Air Serbia in collaboration with Tarom. Since Tarom is an unique airline that includes their checked in bags(23kg) fees in the ticket price I only had to pay the extra fee for my return flight from Belgrade. At Belgrade airport they made me pay an additional 60 eur for checked in luggage which it didn't made sense since it was already paid online and it showed in my ticket (see pics).

### "tried to refund me only the taxes"
Terrible experience. I wanted to change my flight a few days before my original date and they tried to refund me only the taxes which is around 2000 dinars (18euros), and not a dinar more of my original ticket. They didn't want to offer me to pay more for another date, which I specifically wanted to do and I know is possible because I have done it in the past. So instead of paying the difference between two tickets (my original and new date), that difference is around 4000 dinars, they wanted to charge me another 18000 dinars for the new ticket and only refund 2000 dinars from the previous one. Again, I didn't do the check-in for the first flight yet, I didn't confirm it, Never flying with them ever again.

### "giving me a standby ticket"
I bought my ticket from Belgrade to Istanbul a month ago. When i came to check in the girl informed me that the flight is overbooked and she is giving me a standby ticket, and only at the gate i will get to know if im flying or not! I've told her that i have another flight from Istanbul to my final destination, and i cant miss it (the ticket was not a connected one. It was from another company) she said she will input it in a note for the priority to get the place. No apologies, no sorry face. I was just told to go to the gate immediately. Obviously she didn't want to deal with the problem and wanted to get rid of me asap. To add that i came very early for check in and was the first. i approached staff at the gate and explained the situation and demanded to be put on this flight. And again i asked why did it happen as ticket was bought a month ago and fully paid. After i raised my concern and asked to speak to a manager they found a free space and confirmed my seat. And how surprised i was when i saw at least 20 free seats after the gate was closed! To conclude the trip, the flight attendants were not pleasant either. They just cared about giving out the drinks as soon as possible before we land.

### "Crew was very friendly"
Got a very good offer to upgrade and as it allowed me to use the priority screening and having locker space for sure on a busy weekend, I went for it. Was worth the money. Crew was very friendly. Two warm meal options. Actively suggested drinks. Food was good and portion more than enough. Crew topped up water glass automatically. Travelled with hand luggage only. Happy to fly again business. Last Eco flight was 3 years ago and that was good as well. Only negative thing is that I had to go to counter for check-in. Business no issue, if Economy a bit of a hassle. Staff was nice.

### "worst airline I have ever used"
Air Serbia lost my luggage when I arrived in Bucharest on July 1. As of today, no one contact me regarding the status of my baggage. I attempted to call them and no one is picking up the phone. The baggage loss and found department (Romanian Airport Service) at the airport can not be reached because no one is picking up the phone. Not only did no one pick up the phone but worst of all, they also are not responding to email. This is the worst airline I have ever used. it is not worth the trouble.

### "disappointing experience"
2/2 flights delayed by at least an hour with no explanation, no staff around to ask questions or give an estimated departure time. Overall disappointing experience even though staff were present were courteous.

### "seats were good for a 2-hour flight"
I went to Zurich and back from Belgrade on 25.12.2021. and back on 31.12.2021. The cabin was clean, the staff was nice, the toilets were clean and the seats were good for a 2-hour flight. The flights were on time. Economy standard tarrif was about 130 euros return which was super cheap.

### "They really went out of their way"
I was flying from Moscow during these hard times, and the Russian Authorities made it complicated for the airline to depart. The plane was about 5hrs late and everybody missed their connection. Air Serbia gave us a hotel, restaurant access and a packed breakfast for those leaving early. They really went out of their way.

### Air Serbia customer review
This company need serious customer service education. Lack of information, shady answers and waiting time longer then 20 days to answer is something that you need to calculate if you are willing to purchase tickets with this company! They took all my personal documents for ticket refund and they told me they are able to refund 60 bucks for ticket value of 1300$. Air Serbia put me on hold for 20 days for decision. They asked me for additional documents 3 times and got everything they asked for. Unfortunately they decided to offer $60. Airplane was 20 years old, they are using aircrafts which Etihad got rid of. Air crew were nice and food was solid. Conclusion: don’t expect any money back from this airline!

### "worst customer service"
Not Verified | Berlin to Belgrade. Terrible! The worst customer service! They stole my money and no one is even trying to help me solve it. They canceled my flight and when I go to their office, they say: "Try call center". When I try the call center they say: "Write an email" and when I write 15-20 emails, no one is replying. I am Serbian and I am very very disappointed and embarrassed that they represent my country. They should be ashamed and give the job to someone who really wants to work and make this mess better.

### "twice the flights were cancelled"
Air Serbia show flights which have already been cancelled. This allows people to pay for them only to later receive emails offering vouchers. Twice I booked with Air Serbia, twice the flights were cancelled, twice they were still shown as available allowing potential passengers to pay for them.

### "The worst experience ever"
The worst experience ever. Unprofessional and takes no responsibility whatsoever. From Paris airport Charles de Gaulle trying to get to Greece didn't let me get on my plane the day I was trying to get to my father's funeral. After a quick early check-in, we had a great delay on the passport control where I repeatedly asked to let us pass to get to my gate and ground attendants insisted we won't miss our flights that the airline companies are informed for the delay. I got to the gate just at the moment they closed, with my two year old child that was crying after all the wait. The ground attendant a really unkind and ironic young woman didn't let me pass. I was begging to let me go to my family in this tragic day she was cold with no feelings and telling me that the company will lose money if she let me pass. Her phone rings and a member for the plane asked if they are more passengers left. And she says no, three didn't come I looked on her screen because I was next to her and I see my name with yellow lining like the two other persons too. I shout that I am here so she let me pass but hangs up rapidly. Her colleague was upset and tell hers to let me pass and she says no. I asked her name so I can make a report but she hide her badge telling me she won't give it to me. I contact the airline call center tells me to sent an email with details and never responded. It's been five days.

### "horrible customer service"
Because of the airline horrible customer service i am left stranded in NY, having to purchase a ticket with another airline to be able to make it to Serbia. My connection was in NY, and I was erroneously informed at check-in to pickup my luggage in NY, which was not the case since the luggage went directly into the plane to Belgrade. I reached out to the customer service and informed them i will make it to the flight, even though will be close, however they decided not to work with me. I wanted to extend my appreciation to the TSA personnel in NY, who were willing to let me through expeditiously through security , and to let Air Serbia know that I will not fly with them again.

### "I´m very disappointed"
Not Verified |  Paid for a ticket and now I´m left without a ticket and money - I´m very disappointed! I bought an online ticket directly from Air Serbia´s website and the payment was successfully made, reservation code was issued without a problem, but they had some internal system problem issuing the electronic ticket. I´ve called support center and they´ve told me that they didn’t receive the payment and for that reason they can’t help me, even I had a printed reservation that indicated that the payment was made successfully. I called my bank and they confirmed that the funds are with the recipient and the refund must be initiated by them (in this case Air Serbia). Air Serbia wasn’t answering my mails and communicating by phone they confirmed that shortly I should receive the refund, refusing to confirm the same by mail and continuing forwarding me to resolve the problem with my bank. In other words, they´re not interested to solve the problem and trying to avoid extra labor. Finally, I´ve paid for something that I don´t possess, without a ticket for my flight and without my money back… I´m very disappointed with unprofessionalism that employees and Air Serbia in generally possesses. I think Air Serbia doesn’t care about losing clients, at least that’s the impression that I have. I was trying to buy a ticket from Barcelona to Belgrade, but without success and help from the company, and without my money back. This time I will travel with Wizz Air.

### "Would not fly again with this airline"
After booking my round ticket with Air Serbia months in advance, they did not notify me that one of my transit flights had been canceled. I flew from Tirana to Atlanta and had a stop at JFK. When preparing to board my next flight at JFK, I learned that that flight did not even exist. I was left outside of the airport with my luggage and able to contact air Serbia. After contacting them, all they could do was put me on a flight the next day without even apologizing for their mistake (I bought the ticket through them, so they are the ones responsible to notify me about flight chances) and they did not care where would I spent the night. I filled a claim, asking for at least a refund of my hotel expenses for that night. After more than one month I have still not heard anything from them. Sent a couple of reminders to let me know the current situation of my claim, and never received a reply back. Would not fly again with this airline, as I have heard I am not the first one experiences these kind of problems.

### "must land in Moscow only!"
Everything regarding the flight went well and on time, no issues whatsoever. The issues aboard the plane arose due to  undisciplined passengers who kept their (obligatory) masks under their chin as soon as the crew were not looking directly at them to warn them to put it on. Unfortunately, the only penalty for such behavior that the crew have at their disposal is to mark the passenger's name and the airline should ban them from flying with them for the next 5 years. Air Serbia has no warning on their website that Serbian citizens, who are currently allowed to travel to Russia for tourism purposes, must land in Moscow only! I bought a ticket to land in Sankt Petersburg and when the Russian Embassy in Belgrade explicitly told me I must land in Moscow (because I am not in any way a resident of Russia, but just a tourist), Air Serbia charged me the price of another full ticket for this change. They defended it by "availability", but I just think it is not acceptable. I know it is hard to keep up with government policies but it is their job and they should have a warning on their website that warns non-Russian residents that they are buying a ticket to the wrong airport.

### "Do not give this airline your money"
Air Serbia has made it impossible for Covid infected passengers to change the tickets if they get Covid. The change fee is more than the actual ticket cost. I unfortunately got very sick with Covid and notified the airline and travel agency day before my travel. When I got better and got doctor clearance to travel I called both travel agency and Air Serbia and was told the tickets will be $3000 which is more than the initial tickets I paid for and more than the actual ticket price for those dates on Air Serbia website. This is praying on the honesty and plight of Covid sick passengers. In the day of Covid no airline is this cruel to their passengers. Do not give this airline your money.

### "improving its income in this lousy way"
Before departure (Zurich - Belgrade in Economy Class) I received an offer from Air Serbia by email - to upgrade to Business Class. I decided to accept the offer, but only for the return flight (Belgrade -  Zurich) because I wanted to do some shopping in Belgrade and there would be no room for this in just one suitcase. It cost me € 95, which was just debited from my Mastercard. At the check-in in Belgrade - surprise: I have no right to 2 suitcases, only one! In response to my complaint that Business Class ALWAYS includes an allowance for 2 suitcases, I was told that I was entitled to all Business Class amenities - except for the number of suitcases. But this "little thing" is not to be found in the upgrade offer mail from Air Serbia ! !! This argument was also ignored by the Air Serbia officer. In the end I had to pay another 6 € for the "excess" 11kg heavy bag! I suspect that this is not a coincidence, but that Air Serbia is purposely improving its income in this lousy way. Vor dem Abflug (Zürich -> Belgrad in Economy Klasse) habe ich von Air Serbia per Mail ein Angebot erhalten - zu Business Class zu upgraden. Ich entschied mich, das Angebot zu akzeptieren, jedoch nur für den Rückflug (Belgrad -> Zürich) weil ich einiges in Belgrad einkaufen wollte und dies hätte in nur einem Koffer keinen Platz mehr. Es kostete mich 95€, die grad von meiner Mastercard abgebucht wurden. Bei dem Checkin in Belgrad - Überraschung: ich habe kein Anrecht auf 2 Koffer, nur auf einen! Auf meine Reklamation, dass Business Class IMMER Allowance auf 2 Koffer beinhaltet, wurde mir erklärt dass auf alle Annehmlichkeiten der Business Class ich Anrecht habe - bis auf Koffer-Anzahl. Diese "Kleinigkeit" aber ist in der Upgrade-Angebot-mail von Air Serbia nicht zu finden!!! Auch dieser Argument wurde von Air Serbia Beamtin ignoriert. Am Ende musste ich für das "überschüssige" 11kG schweren Gepäckstück weitere 65€ zahlen! Ich vermute dass dies kein Zufall ist, sondern dass Air Serbia gezielt auf diese miese Art ihre Einkünfte ausbessert.

### "I could not wish anything more from an airline"
This is not the first time I flew Air Serbia, but it was the first flying business class. One thing that none of the people complaining about broken wheels (I had those broken by Lufthansa and never saw a refund either!) are saying is that Air Serbia seems to be one of the very few airlines in the world respecting the safety distancing rules that airlines are supposed to obey but do not! All the middle seats on our flight, both in the Economy and Business class were blocked. After flying Air Serbia in December I had to fly Turkish, AeroMexico, Avianca and Viva Colombia and none of them had this policy - we flew as packed as ever. So, hat down to Air Serbia for going this extra mile and flying half empty planes in order to make passengers safer during the pandemic. Every other aspect of our trip was just fine: there was a wonderful lounge with free food in Belgrade, which we used before the flight, the big meal on the flight, we flew safely and comfortably, the crew was very kind and polite, our luggage made it, and the touchdown at Istanbul was like landing on cotton. I could not wish anything more from an airline. Thank you and keep up the good work.

### "refusing any kind of compensation"
This is the second time our luggage has been damaged. First time a wheel has been broken and I thought “ok, it happens” but this time two of three luggages have been destroyed. I know they rough with the luggage and all but I wish I could see how did they manage this kind of damage. To top it all off they are refusing any kind of compensation.

### "won't even give me a credit back"
Not Verified |  I purchased 6 tickets to fly with my family on 24 December 2020 to Belgrade from JFK. Tickets are for me and my husband and our 4 children. However because of such a high cases of Covid in Belgrade we decided that it’s unsafe for our children and us to travel at this time and also per our governers advisory of Washington DC. I reached out to Air Serbia and of course they don’t care even tho I travel with Air Serbia two time a year to go back home and they won't even give me a credit back to purchase another ticket. They want me to pay penalty for each ticket before changing which is $250 per ticket.

### "do yourself a favour and choose any other airline"
I have been a regular flyer for the last few years and Air Serbia is without doubt the most incompetent airline I have ever flown with. The staff do not know what they are doing, they repeatedly ask you "We see you are flying hand luggage only" despite having paid for hold luggage. They have no idea about what citizens need a visa for said country. Their website is beyond awful, once you have made a booking it says error so you think that you need to try again, in fact the booking has been successful and you now have two bookings. In addition to all of this, their flight prices are the most extortionate I have ever seen, do yourself a favour and choose any other airline to this one.

### "Not respecting single Covid-19 rule"
Belgrade to Berlin with Air Serbia. Not respecting single Covid-19 rule, no sanitizers, employees not wearing masks! Using small planes that are super crowded and no space for legs, seats are super small. It is worse than flying with a low-cost airline!

### "only refunded me for airport taxes"
Not Verified | I bought a ticket for 18.06. however as I was prevented from traveling (corona virus) I had to postpone the flight for 02.07. I called the call center and they said I had to pay 90e because of the price difference. In the meantime, I had to reschedule the flight for 09.07. and again to pay another 50EUR. Due to the impossibility of traveling, I wanted to postpone the flight again, but since I no longer knew for which date I wanted to leave the ticket open and use it until the end of this year, which they did not allow, and I had to choose another date and pay 50EUR again. In the end, I did not want to pay for the postponement of the ticket again, and I asked for a refund. I paid 300EUR for the ticket and they only refunded me 55EUR for airport taxes. I couldn’t get the rest of the money because the flight was operational. Btw they don't reply to e-mails and the call center can hardly be reached.

### "Bad customer support"
Not Verified |  The only way you can fly to Belgrade from Sweden. Old planes. Bad customer support. I have emailed and called several times for two weeks but they simply don't answer. Cabin crew with bad attitude

### "have not received any amount"
Not Verified |  We purchased two tickets Ljubljana to Athens on 2 Mar 2020 in EUR 140 and within 24 hours because of Covid-19 cases in Ljubljana, requested for the refund as per their 100% refund policy. On 5 Mar they wrote us they will only refund only 66 EUR within 7-30 days, but as on 5 May 2020 we have not received any amount. What type of airline is Air Serbia? We repeatedly requested the airline to refund, every time they said 7-30 days, you will get the refund but as on date not received any amount.

### "Not professional"
Tirana to Lubljana via Belgrade. I had my flight 22 March. I asked at the beginning to anticipate but no way. Cause of coronavirus and was told to. Me only taxes can be reimbursed. For sure I said ok at least the taxes. I also asked later for a bonus with the same company cause of the situation covid but was told. To. At the beginning I try to talk to them but after 30 min in phone waiting international call I tried by email. And by email they told was not possible the bonus. Still have to wait for the money of the airport taxes. Not professional when my  friends from other companies had the money back. Or bonus.

### "dismissed all these claims"
Our flight JU 802 to Istanbul on 30.12.2019 has been delayed by more than three hours. I missed my shuttle bus to Istanbul Sabiha airport and had to take the taxi in order not to miss my flight from SAW on New Year's eve (100km distance). We arrived at 19:00 local time instead of 15:55. Scheduled departure 12:20. The aircraft (YU-API) arrived one hour late from Milan. On departure we were notified that the catering truck has broken down. Then boarding started at 13:00. At 14:00 we were informed the crew duty hours have expired. We departed only around 15:00. Time at gate on arrival at IST was 19:00. Then we discovered that Air Serbia has been transporting hundreds of Lufthansa bags from Frankfurt which was the real reason of the delay. Passengers were unable to get their luggage cause the baggage carousel (meant for A320) has been blocked by Lufthansa bags coming from a wide-body from Munich (flight waited in Belgrade). It is horrible that Air Serbia gives priorities on New year's holidays to bags from Lufthansa than to their own passengers. Our bags arrived last. Finally i received my luggage at 19:30 and had one hour to arrive at an airport 100km away (6 hours planned for that trip). The taxi  cost me 55 Eur. (60.61 USD). Also, although the delay exceeded 2 hours, we weren't offered any refreshments whatsoever. Air Serbia dismissed all these claims saying they were late 'only' 2h20 minutes on departure and they won't compensate any expenses incured. Disgraceful.

### "I do not recommend this airline"
Zurich to Beirut via Belgrade. This Airline is very unprofessional. My flights were cancelled exactly 15 days before departure so the airline would not pay indemnities. They offered to contact them via phone. My calls were never answered and I had to pay an expensive price for all the calls. My online claim was never responded to and I did not get any alternatives to my ticket. Although the airline indicate that refund is made within 7 working days, I have been waiting for two weeks with no refund. I do not recommend this airline.

### "No customer support"
Amsterdam to Belgrade. Lost one of my bags. 39 days past the statutory 60 day deadline for solving the claim and its I still not resolved, 99 days and counting. No customer support and false promises.

### "Worst airline I have ever used"
Not Verified |  Would give the airline zero if it was possible. I flew with them from Helsinki to Ljubljana via Belgrade. First problem was that about a week after booking the flight they have moved the second flight for almost 2 hours (longer layover in Belgrade). The same thing happened again three days before departure, they moved the second flight again for another hour and a half. At the end we were delayed for 2 hours without any explanation. When I finally reached my destination in the plane probably 30 years older than me with no space for legs or carry-on luggage, I learned that my luggage was destroyed. The handle used for rolling the suitcase was broken, there were big tears in the material and also a big dent. All together the baggage is now not usable and I cannot get it repaired. Following the instructions and filling out the damage claim at the destination airport I submitted a claim to Air Serbia. They replied that they are not liable and that their decision regarding my claim was final. Worst airline I have ever used and will never fly with them again.

### "will try to avoid this airline"
Belgrade to Kiev. My experience with Air Serbia did not start well, whilst I was booking my ticket online I was asked me for my Visa details for Ukraine, despite the fact that i'm a British citizen and don't need a Visa. The online form would not allow me to skip this information so I ended up having to call customer service. To be fair to Air Serbia it was not difficult to get through to an agent and the phone call was charged at a normal rate. Once I was connected to an operator we cleared up the issue, and then the lady said "Oh by the way, I can see you have not paid for any luggage". I told her with some indignation that I had paid for an extra suitcase and eventually she found this to be correct. Between then and my flight I also received numerous emails telling me that I had not paid for luggage Once I arrived at the airport the idiocy continued on Air Serbia's part, I was once again asked for my Visa and the check in person had to call someone to ask them if I needed Visa. Eventually someone confirmed I did not. Then they said again "Did you know that you haven''t paid for extra luggage?! Speechless Once on the plane everything was fine, I will try to avoid this airline in future, they are also exorbitantly expensive on many routes

### "I wouldn't use Air Serbia"
Not Verified |  Belgrade to Zurich. Employees are rude, non-caring and just don't care for passengers. Instead of helping passengers with their questions and problems, they brush them off and keep doing what they were doing before someone even asked them for help, that is, nothing! Even though I'm a Serbian myself, I experienced first-hand their hospitality and their non-willingness to help many times! Tonight it was enough, as far as I'm concerned I wouldn't use Air Serbia! There are many more airlines that are much better than them. Not to mention, cheaper.

### "a mess within a company"
Moscow to Vienna via Belgrade. It was my first and the last flight with Air Serbia. I will never fly with this company again. First, I tried to order (and pay for it) a special meal. The website of Air Serbia is quite bad, many functions do not work and it was no possible to order a special meal on the website in “My bookings” section. My booking even did not appear on my personal webpage. So, I sent an email with my booking number to Air Serbia. To order a special meal they advised me to call one of the offices of Air Serbia at the airports and order it. I have spent more than 90 minutes in total on the phone trying to reach different offices in Vienna, Moscow, Krasnodar, Copenhagen, Berlin and Belgrade. Every time I was waiting more than 15 minutes on the line and listened to the message “Please hold the line, all operators are busy”. That time I did not reach the call center by the phone. I sent again an email to their email address, informed them that it is not possible to reach an office, gave them my phone number and asked them to call me back kin order to order a special meal. Nobody called me back and nobody answered to my email. 36 hours before departure I got an email from Air Serbia with an invitation to do online check-in for the flight. I wanted to buy a seat on the first row but in the last step, system did not allow me to proceed with the payment for seat reservation because of a mistake on the website of Air Serbia. So, I decided to call the Air Serbia call centre again. On Jan 6 at 9-57 (Moscow time) I finally reached Air Serbia. I asked the agent to help me with online check-in and to order for me a special meal. The agent told me that it is not possible to order a special meal and she does not the reason why it is not possible. She just told me “I do not know how I can order in the system a special meal for this flight”. As regards online check-in she started to proceed with the booking and after 10 minutes she told me that she cannot choose a seat for me because “the seats are already at the airport in Moscow” and I can register only at the airport. I told her that it cannot be the truth but she was absolutely useless and did not want to help. She could even hardly speak English. I spent almost 15 minutes on the phone with her and she did absolutely nothing for me. I asked her name for a complaint and she refused to tell it to me. I told her that I hope that the call has been recorded. 2 hours before departure I got an email from them (which was obviously an answer to my request which I sent a week ago) where another agent wrote me that a special meal should be ordered 24 hours in advance. I think that Air Serbia agents are very unprofessional. It is a mess within a company, the call center does not work, the agents do not care about clients and they simply do not know how to work. The plane from Belgrade to Vienna was extremely old and it was not enough space between seats. The seat in front of me was broken. As a snack we got two small pieces of cookies and a small bottle of water. I even cannot call it “snack”.

### "Delay in flights and luggage"
Moscow to Milan via Belgrade. Delay in flights and luggage delivery. Your luggage will be lost at 95% because they use small airplane And exceed the takeoff weight so definitely they take only the first half or even less than 50% of the passenger’s suite cases and expect if you get lucky to receive your lugage in the next 6 to 8 weeks after. As for this moment, I am leaving MXP to Singapore without my suitecas and I don’t know where I will get it or maybe will not and as of the This moment.

### "cancelled the returning flight"
Frankfurt to Tirana via Belgrade. Worst airline ever. I had a two way ticket and didn't use the first one, so the company just cancelled the returning flight without contacting me first or letting me know about that. I had to spent a lot of money calling their support (because the representative in Tirana Airport was useless). They even told me they would refund 79euro which they did not! The ticket was way more then that.

### "do not ever use this airline"
Bucharest to New York via Belgrade on 3rd January. My first flight landed in Timisoara (TMR), a small city in Romania instead of Belgrade, around 10:30am. They said it was too foggy but all other flights that day managed to land on BEG so the reason is dubious. Then, we ended up spending ~10hr in Belgrade, without any food, or information from AirSerbia representatives. I know they are obligated to give you food and water if the delay is longer than 2-3 hours. There were no representatives of any company to talk to in the TMR airport because we were at the gates and it is a very small airport. After realizing that I missed my connection from BEG to JFK, I called AirSerbia but they said that it is not their fault and they cannot do anything and once I get to Belgrade they will try to help. At ~4:30pm, after 6 hours of waiting, they decided that there will send a bus to take us from TMR to BEG (> 3hr of driving, while the OTP - BEG flight was ~1hr) and the plane will return to OTP and we have to make a decision of what to do. I would like to mention that the road death rate in Romania is of ~100 deaths / 1M people and that of flying is ~0 so it is absolutely unacceptable to ask us to take a bus to BEG, put our lives in such danger since we did not book a bus we booked a plane ticket. They did not want to send another aircraft although they had the resources to do so. They promised the bus will leave around ~5pm but then said it won't leave until 6-7pm. It ended up leaving after 8pm. Realizing we would be arriving extremely late to Belgrade and there won't be much support for us there (there were barely any flights to NYC in the next few days and all of them were extremely expensive and pretty much none with AirSerbia for the next week or so). I called AirSerbia to ask them to book my ticket since we were going to Belgrade and I wanted confirmation that once in Belgrade I have everything set and there is actually a point in going there. I would have preferred to do this before making my decision but they made us decide on the spot with no information of where and how we can get rerouted if we choose either option. AirSerbia told me that they cannot book on the phone and they cannot book a ticket if I go back to Bucharest with the flight which is insane given that the plane was the only way of transportation I had paid for. Anyway, around 7pm, I decided to not take the bus to Belgrade because I did not want to risk my life and get my own flight back and fight them via complaints and in court. Please do not ever use this airline! !

### "fight them until they rebook"
New York to Bucharest via Belgrade. If your flight gets cancelled or delayed, call and fight them until they rebook or reimburse you, and and do not accept a "it's not possible, we cannot do anything, there are no connections". Answer, it is within your rights!! Also submit a claim against them to get compensated for a delayed or cancelled flight.

### "he did not use the incoming ticket"
Not Verified |  Stockholm to Belgrade. The worst airline. I would recommend everyone avoid it if they can. Today my brother was supposed to return to Serbia with that company, but he couldn't because they sold his ticket. I was told that because he did not use the incoming ticket, so he automatically canceled the return ticket. Otherwise, he found out an hour before the flight, and in the meantime, emails were arriving to upgrade the flight with bigger luggage.

### "happy to recommend it"
Milan to Istanbul via Belgrade. After reading these reviews I was rather apprehensive about the trip, and indeed there was a delay for my first flight (I think because they needed a replacement aircraft), with the flight arriving Belgrade 40 minutes late. However, the airport in Belgrade is very small and pleasant, and a joy to change in, when compared to bigger hubs like Frankfurt, and I (and my luggage) made the connection despite only having 40 minutes between the flights. Staff both at the airport and on the aircraft were perfectly polite. The flights were satisfactory and there was a bottle of water and crisps or biscuits handed out. You don’t get the explanations or the polish you’d get on British Airways for example, but it was perfectly adequate and very good value. The connecting flight to Istanbul arrived on time and was comfortable, so based on my experience I’d be happy to recommend it.

### "stunned about how bad this airline"
Athens to Helsinki via Belgrade. Our company booked the trip trough Air Serbia website. I was travelling together with my boss and colleague who had return flights from Helsinki to Athens but I flew to (Athens) from Rome. We booked one-way ticket from Air Serbia website. After filling the payment information we got the "Trip Confirmation" to our e-mail with Confirmation code. This was only e-mail we received from Air Serbia. We printed out this document and showed it at the check in desk on 29.10.2019. They replied "there is no such booking and the aircraft is overbooked". We did not understand what they meant by "overbooked" and why a confirmed flight did not exist. There was no help at the airport to sort the situation so we called Air Serbia. They repeated "we have no such booking". For a reason or another this trip was cancelled and we never got a good answer for why. There was enough credit on the card, the trip was confirmed from the company, we had the necessary document from the confirmation but could not check in. I had to get back to Finland soonest possible and the airline did not do anything about this so my boss booked me a return ticket to the next available flight (Air Turkey) 724,51€ that is quite much for a trip that should cost around 100€. Later at the airport I contacted Air Serbia again and now they replied that "we can see the booking but maybe there has been some problem with Air Serbia website". They did not give any explanation about why this flight was cancelled?! Maybe because they had overbooked the plane and had to drop out someone?? I am stunned about how bad this airline handled this situation. The rest of the evaluation about the flight comes from my boss whose reservation was valid.

### "Rude staff, long lines"
Helsinki to Athens via Belgrade. Worst airline ever! Rude staff, long lines, no food, dirty airplanes that have a weird smell. They changed the airplane before the flight from an Airbus A320 jet to some old Boeing (probably 737) it took off shaking left and right and smelled like something was burning. The sound system gave me a headache and what they were saying was unintelligible even the safety instructions. I have seen third world countries airlines with better services and standards. Even budget airlines are way more comfortable. If you are thinking about flying with Air Serbia then think again. I am never afraid of flying but this time I did feel flying anxiety on board their flights.

### "impressed with my flight"
Not Verified |  Helsinki to Rome via Belgrade. Was very impressed with my flight with Air Serbia. The seats were OK comfort wise. I was very impressed with the food service - our flight to Belgrade was 2 hours long and we got complimentary cookies and water. On our next flight, which was 1 hour, we got complimentary chips and water. I was not expecting to be given anything to eat on this short flight. I would recommend Air Serbia, but avoid a stop in Belgrade if you can.

### "worse than on budget airlines"
Ljubljana to Athens via Belgrade . One of the most unreliable airlines in Europe: constantly long delays which frequently result in missing connections. Lack of professional service both on the ground and in the air. Unfriendly and indifferent cabin staff. Unacceptable preseating policy. A very cheap product in general, even worse than on budget airlines. Very bad value for money: a rough low cost service at a not at all low cost price. Should be avoided at any cost.

### "unhelpful customer service"
Not Verified |  I wanted to book a ticket from London to Belgrade, but the web site displayed and error during the payment step (I am using a MasterCard issued by a big UK bank and haven't had many issues with online payments). I tried to pay again, and got the same message. Then I went through all the steps again, but the web page again displayed the same error message. After failing to purchase the ticket three times, I decided to use a different airline for the flight. I bought a ticket there with no problems. Half an hour later I received an email confirming my AirSerbia reservation. I immediately called their customer service to ask for a refund. I was told that I need to send an email with all the details. I did that. The next day I received a response stating that they cannot refund the full price of the ticket. I tried again explaining everything, but no luck again. I can only get about half of the ticket price refunded according to the ticket conditions, even though the whole problem was because of a bug in their system. So my interaction with AirSerbia resulted in my being out of a few hundred pounds because of a bug in their system and unhelpful customer service. I am not going to use their services in the future.

### "management is absolutely horrendous"
Split to Madrid via Belgrade. Was meant to transit in Belgrade for 45 minutes. However first flight was delayed by about 50 minutes. When we got to Belgrade we had to rush to collect transit tickets and run to catch the flight. When we arrived in Madrid, our luggage never showed up. Had to spend even more time at the airport making delayed / lost baggage reports. A total of 3 hours wasted! And the next day, the status of my luggage is still showing as "pending". Another girl on the flight had this happen to her both ways. Calling their 24 hour contact centre is useless. I tried this from the originating airport and am trying it now again. You are on hold forever, no one ever picks up the call. The flight and attendants are fine. But the airline management is absolutely horrendous! Do not fly them unless you are prepared to face flight delays, lost luggage and zero support after.

### "not too friendly but were polite"
Vienna to Belgrade. My wife and me fly a lot of times with different airlines during the year - and this could also have been an flight with Eurowings, Austrian Airlines or something like this. The personnel was not too friendly but were polite. As we had booked an Economy ticket, we were able to check in our luggage for free without any problems. The flight had no delay and we arrived Belgrade punctual. Our luggage arrived without any damage.

### "Ruined my experience"
New York to Tel Aviv via Belgrade. Worst airline I have ever flown with. 2 big delays. No solutions for the people. The only solution is to stay 2 nights in Serbia. Shame. Ruined my experience in New York. Will not book this airline ever again

### "no info, no answers"
Moscow to Podgorica via Belgrade. One of the worst companies I've ever flown with. 1.5 hr delay, lost luggage, no answer the whole day, when finally answered, the representative said they don't work on weekends! I'm in a foreign country without having a piece of cloth to put on myself, no info, no answers, never fly with Air Serbia please, never.

### "Worst flights ever"
Beirut to Barcelona via Belgrade. Worst flights ever! They took me all around Europe due to the connecting flights that they delayed and missed! Time is disrespected! We were like bunch of beggars at the counter in Belgrade where staff maltreated us, as if we were garbage.

### "the worst airline ever"
Booked flight Etihad from Kuala Lumpur to London on 10 August. First transit in Abu Dhabi, second transit in Belgrade. Code share  with Air Serbia (JU). Flight from Belgrade to London was cancelled 1 hour prior to departure. JU reschedule flight 24hrs after that (4.50pm, 12Aug). Our agent in Kuala Lumpur have make numerous calls to Air Serbia, and they are unable to rebook our flight to earlier time. Worse they said she has rebooked flight from Belgrade to Brussels to London (arrive in London around 1145am, 12Aug) and even given us the booking number & ticket number. Turn out that it is a lie. Etihad Airways offers zero help at all too, saying that Air Serbia has taken over the booking and there’s nothing they can do about it. We’re stuck at Belgrade airport for more than 24hrs. Ground staff refuse to help on obtaining visa or even offering hotel for the screw up they make. This is the worst airline ever. And we blame Etihad too for simply forsaking their duties to their paying customer!

### "been a bad experience"
Not Verified |  Belgrade to Stockholm. We have flown with Air Serbia many times and I am sorry to say that every time it has been a bad experience. Always late and the service is very bad - not to recommend.

### "complete and utter disaster"
Berlin to Cairo via Belgrade. Company is a complete and utter disaster. Starting from the booking of my ticket, I did not get an e-ticket via email as the booking process got interrupted only to find out the ticket was booked via my credit card notification. The flight from Berlin to Belgrade was delayed 2 hours - in information was given on whether connecting flight can be caught or not and whether it even makes sense to fly. In Belgrade it got even worse. Connecting flight to Cairo was delayed by 3 hours, no refreshments were provided. After boarding plane turned back and we had to disembark cause suddenly they realized that the crew was too long in the air. Security handled the justifiable anger of the passengers by detaining five for talking too loud while no further explanations were given on what will happen next. Never again

### "company is terrible"
❎ Not Verified | Amsterdam to Belgrade. This company is terrible! I booked the ticket for my mom to visit me in Los Angeles. She had a flight back from LAX to AMS and then in Amsterdam, she just received a text that her flight to Belgrade (operated by Air Serbia) was canceled, without any further notice for more than 24h. She is an older lady with a high blood pressure stuck in the airport without hotel provided or anything else. After more than 24h of me calling and my family, we arranged another flight for her (not Air Serbia) and finally, she is back home safe and sound. Don't ever travel on Air Serbia, they don't care about their passengers.

### "time didn’t seem to be a concern"
Copenhagen to Athens via Belgrade. The plane arrived almost an hour late on their first flight arriving from Belgrade. They didn’t pick up any of the lost time on the way and feared our luggage wouldn’t make it on to the connected flight from Belgrade to Athens. That didn’t become an issue. Because the next plane was delayed as well. No information was shared. Watching the ground staff, the passengers time didn’t seem to be a concern for Air Serbia, so no one understood why the plane was delayed.

### "baggage fee was excessive"
Ljubljana to Split via Belgrade. 50 euros baggage fee for 1 checked 10 kg bag was excessive. Also, my last 3 messages to their Facebook page about my flight were never replied to. One part of my flight was 25 minutes late, no explanation.

### "seat pitch was very good"
Athens to Stuttgart via Belgrade. Well-kept aircraft, seat pitch was very good and seats were leather covered. Service was limited to a small bottle of water and crackers, everything else you have to pay. There is a good option to visit the Belgrade Airport lounge for €18 where you can be in a modern, quiet space with great food and alcoholic drinks. Service there was superb. You can upgrade to Business from €60 where there is access to lounge, 2 carry on and food during flight.

### "recommend avoiding Air Serbia"
Belgrade to Berlin. I recommend avoiding Air Serbia at any cost. Their badly implemented website made me thinking I successfully bought ticket with hold luggage included which was not the case. That's gonna cost me additional 50 euros now. I couldn't even bought an extra-legroom seat due to 'unexpected bug', as they operator claims.

### "avoid if at all possible"
Venice to Athens via Belgrade. I rarely give bad review so I will keep it short; mighty be best to avoid if at all possible, save yourself the hassle. The price is not worth the stress of late flightS or the unpleasantness of the flight (the noise from the motors was very loud from beginning to end). Flight and ground crew were nice.

### "many problems are showing up"
Belgrade to Amsterdam. Serious bag and problems during online check in process. They need to fix this at once! Once you have selected and paid for seat in online check-in process you can't go back or deselect them and return to a free one. The only thing you can do and that I found out after calling customer support is to wait for a manual restart of check-in process and that needs approx. 2 hours. What will happen if your credit card is not accepted for seat payment, like in my case, and you are checking in just hours before the flight? Customer support was not surprised by my question like it's something normal. She even suggested to leave her with credit card information so that they can authorize by themself. Air Serbia looks like a fresh and modern aviation company from the outside, but from the inside, many problems are showing up. Hopefully, management will change soon with addition to government of Serbia stepping out from owner structure.

### "recommend you to avoid them"
Avoid them at any cost. In January 2018, Air Serbia cancelled our flight Los Angeles to Dusseldorf and Dusseldorf to Belgrade. Since then, we have been trying to get our money back, more than $1000, for the missing flights. First with an indirect claim via the seller of the tickets (MyTrip.com) and then directly via Air Serbia customer support. Until today, we got only replies from Air Serbia asking to give them some more time. The reality is, their customer service has no intention to solve this claim and gives us back our money. As a regular customer of Air Serbia so far, I recommend you to avoid them at any cost.

### "a whole week with no luggage"
Skopje to New York via Belgrade. Last time ever we are flying with Air Serbia. I don’t even know where to begin. First of all when we landed in Belgrade they delayed our flight. I asked them why & they replied to me “there is no plane”. How are they selling plane tickets if they don’t have a plane. Second of all I when I got to Skopje I was there for a whole week with no luggage. I had a wedding & I didn’t have any of my stuff. I had to buy a new dress for the wedding and new clothes for that whole week. After a week only one of my luggage came. The second luggage came three days after. On the way back home I didn’t get my luggage again for 5 days. The people in Belgrade at the airport are very rude and not helpful at all. I would speak English to them because I don’t speak Serbian & they would reply in Serbian. I even told them & they still didn’t speak English.

### "it was a nice flight"
Check-in for the flight went fine, and gate 21 at T4 at Heathrow used for Air Serbia flights is very spacious and nice for aircraft spotting. Flight from Belgrade arrived on time, but boarding started some 15 minutes prior scheduled departure so we were slightly delayed, and arrival in Belgrade was 5 minutes late after scheduled arrival. The cabin was full in economy and only one passenger in business (there were 9 businesses seats available for this flight). Business class is now changed, earlier it used to have different leather seats in configuration 2-2 and now it is flexible, the seats are the same as in economy 3-3 with guaranteed empty middle seat. Soon after departure crew gave us free snacks and a glass of water. Later on, they started serving sandwiches, drinks and snacks from their Deli menu (paid menu). Unfortunately, no hot food available on this 2.5 hour flight was available. Prices of Deli menu were fair and the quality of food was good - much better than they served them for free in the past. My opinion is that it’s better to get tasty sandwich for money now than two pieces of bread with butter inside for free :) Airline crew did their job professionally and their appearance was nice. Captain made few announcements during the flight about our route and weather conditions at the destination airport so that was fine too. There was no flight entertainment available but I had option to buy WiFi internet access. Landing went fine. Overall, it was a nice flight.

### "avoid Air Serbia"
Milan to Belgrade. I would suggest to anyone to avoid Etihad in general and especially Air Serbia. Often Etihad sells tickets under its name and afterwards flight is operated by Air Serbia (all flights via belgrade) and that is the biggest nightmare you can have. Terrible service in general, flights aways delayed for at least 45-60 min. Often longer delays. My last experience - engine got on fire while the airplane was leaving the gate, and following this we had 10 hours delay (2 hours in the plane, 2 hanging around begging for info, 2 further reschedulings of the departure). Air Serbia is keeping the monopoly of Belgrade airport and I need to use it unfortunately, but if you can avoid it, do it!

### "crew always friendly"
Milan to Belgrade. I flew with Air Serbia many times and never have any problems. Now they selling food druring the flight just like most of the airlines. The airplane was nice and clean, the crew always friendly and the departure was on time and arrival also. We have a great sunny day to fly so everything went perfect.

### "food is abysmal and scarce"
Bucharest to New York via Belgrade. Very old, dirty plane. It was one of the few times I was actually too hot during the ride. There are no personal A/C vents to control, so you just have to deal with it if you are too cold or too hot. The seats are often broken and do not recline properly. They offer very little ergonomic support. The entertainment offerings are minimal and outdated. You're lucky if your screen is even working though. The bathrooms are filthy. Things barely work and flies everywhere. The stewardesses are unprofessional. We had one lady that held 20 minutes chat with some Serbian passenger behind us. Who would want someone standing right in their grill talking Serbian for half the ride? The food is abysmal and scarce. 3 stars for arriving alive. It's a cheap airline which helps connecting New Yorkers to Eastern Europe more easily, but be prepared for a very unglamorous ride.

### "don't seem to care"
In August I bought a round ticket from Belgrade to Larnaca for October I bought their white tariff, I needed to change the departure date just a few days later and I wanted to keep the return for the same date. What happend was that I went directly to their office in Belgrade to ask if this is possible they gave me the information that they are not dealing with tickets bought online so I had to make a call to the call center. Women in the call center told me that I got the wrong information in their office that I need to buy a new ticket for both ways so I did but I asked what about refund if I cancel this one that I'm obviously not going to be able to use she said I don't know maybe you can get some kind of taxes write an email. So I did, of course I didn't get a response at all I only got automated email. The second issue is Online check in. So if you don't do it online they can charge you for checking in at the airport and there is no way you could know how much if you don't make a call and ask so I found that out on the day of my flight when I once again called call center. The third issue is meals and beverages on the flight, they canceled everything that is just beyond disrespectful because the prices are only going up. So what you get when you fly with airserbia is just a 0,25ml bottle of water. They are really not committed to what they are doing so the flight atendent made so many mistakes when she was talking on the microphone, she completely missed the name of the country and the city where we landed. They don't seem to care about the customers and complaints, trying to charge you on every step from the beginning if you get your ticket via phone you have to pay 15 euros for ticket fee, if you get your tickets via their official office the ticket fee is 20 euros, the regular check in from 10 to 30 euros, Wi-Fi in the cabin is not free of course, food and beverages for purchase.

### "No more Air Serbia."
Not Verified |  Zürich to Belgrade. Previously the pride of Serbia, today a low cost airline, but it does not want to be. While tariffs higher than 3 years ago, but where everything was included in the price. Sandwiches, drinks, seats, everything today has to be paid for. Staff rude, stressed, unmotivated. I flew from Zurich to Belgrade with Air Serbia 30 times a year, now I'm switching to Swiss - their price half as expensive, full board service, miles at the cheapest fare, drinks of your choice. No more Air Serbia.

### "inefficient and without passion"
Sofia to Copenhagen via Belgrade. Air Serbia likes to pride itself as an Etihad Partner, and once it was very good. Inflight meals has now been cancelled, you are only able to choose your seat at web check in if you pay, you need to print your boarding card before arriving at the airport, and ticket prices has gone up. Lower service and higher prices. So Air Serbia  has now joined the LCC concept. Seats has improved, service onboard is slow, inefficient and without passion. Staff actually yawned in front of the guests. A far cry from previous experience with this airline. Looking at the ticket prices comparing it to service and value, Wizzair is a fine alternative.

### "wouldn't recommend at all"
Belgrade to Tivat. Their website is horrible. I had problems buying a ticket because it is very buggy. Huge problem for me in the end was that I couldn't replace the ticket without losing a lot of money. The problem with comparing it to other websites of other companies is that it is not clearly written. It is a link with small letter, which when you press, you see the prices of type of flight and what are the limitations. This was the cheapest ticket so refund or changing the ticket was impossible. In the end I had to buy another ticket and I felt like they stole money from me. Literally. I felt like I gave money to some scam website. For that reason I wouldn't recommend this company at all.

### "worst airline ever"
Belgrade to Saint Petersburg. The airline is trying to scam you out of money at every step through their website. They list one price and then hide in small letters that it is with hand luggage only and that normal luggage costs an additional 100 EUR. Then you have to check-in online, or they charge you an additional 30 EUR. Then they say that if you don't select your seat you will be assigned a random one free of charge, but if you want to check the prices of seats you have to select one and then you can't unselect it, and you have to pay regardless if you want to select a seat or not. Worst airline ever.

### "very dismal experience"
Athens to Rome via Belgrade. I flew Air Serbia from Athens to Belgrade, as a stopover to Rome. A very tight connection time and a problem with the airbridge, which further eroded the already little time to catch the final flight made me overlook the fact that I had placed my most important souvenirs from Greece in the overhead compartment. I realized that when I was on the following flight, and asked the flight personnell what to do. One of the staff offered to talk to the Air Serbia representative at the door, at landing, which she did. The airline representative made (maybe) one attempt to call someone in Belgrade, just to tell me that he received no answer, and adviced that I should write to baggage services, which I immediately did, after getting home. I soon received an automated reply, saying that I would receive a follow up in the next 24 hours. Nobody ever wrote. Then I tried to contact the lost and found service, by phone, and stayed half hours waiting for someone to answer in English, but no way. I also wrote to a different mail address and again no reply. We contacted Air Serbia via Facebook, as they advise, and they replied that I should contact the lost and found service in Belgrade, which of course I had already done. Well, even acknowledging one's fault in forgetting something on the plane, it was an easy task, after all, to go and pick up something left at a very precise place. And nobody was able to do that, or even tried to. A very dismal experience, never again.

### "planes are in horrible condition"
Vienna to Belgrade. Avoid, if you can! Planes are in horrible condition! Way below any low cost airline! Locked up on a plane without any AC. The staff is not willing to help at all and is just ignoring you! Very arrogant!

### "My advice : avoid them"
Not Verified |  Paris to Athens via Belgrade. You know a good airline to the way they manage a crisis situation like delays, etc. There was a massive IT mess in Belgrade airport the day I was traveling to Greece (connection in Belgrade). My first flight was delayed by 5 hours. Of course, the connection was missed. But the staff of Air Serbia still made us onboard promising that a connection would be given in Belgrade and that compensation would be refused if we were to travel with another company. At Belgrade there was no plane waiting for us. They made us wait hours so that we can get to a hotel. Staff seemed as lost as us. 200+ other passengers were stuck in the hotel with us. The lady at the counter of the hotel said "it's the 3rd time something like this happens in 2 weeks". That gives you a good idea of the level of the quality of that airline and the Belgrade airport. My advice (same as for Czech Airline, Bulgarian Airlines, all the balkans / east europe cheap companies): avoid them and especially their flights with connections.

### "Beware hidden baggage fees"
Zurich to Athens via Belgrade. Beware of hidden baggage fees! If you are traveling Economy, you should know there are three subclasses: white, red and blue. The only way you can see this is to click into a hidden panel on the baggage info page, not clearly marked as a clickable item. I booked through Expedia which interfaced with the Air Serbia site, and it did not disclose that my fare was "White" economy and not eligible for the 1st checked bag free. Red and Blue seem to allow most flights to have 1st free up to 23kg. So not only was I delayed at the airport but I have to pay an additional 60€ for each way, making my "discount fare" 120€ more expensive than the other airlines I considered. Also, there was no attendant in the Zurich airport for Air Serbia, and another worker said they were unreliable showing up at the ticket counter. Flight was delayed, endangering my connection. The plane itself was new, the legroom decent. Flight attendants were smiling and pleasant. I'm not sure I'd use them again. I feel that was pretty sneaky about the luggage price.

### "the worst Business Class"
Amsterdam to Thessaloniki via Belgrade. Air Serbia became a really poor airline in Business Class. It used to be the best in Europe, now the worst: only 1 claustrophic row (curtain directly behind you and bulkhead in front of you) with those uncomfortable rockhard, straight up slim recaro seats, no pre take off drink, no pillows, no blankets, no PTV, no meal (you get a small cardboard box with a few local snacks squished / smashed into it and every flight the same one), no placemat, paper napkins, plastic glasses and plastic cutlery. As a desert you get a tiny biscuit wrapped in plastic and heaven forbid if you ask a second are told no. Only 1 allowed, even though they have plenty, as they sell them in economy. Personally, I think this is now the worst Business Class in Europe. I can't think of an airline where the offering is so poor. Wifi was also broken.

### "way below any budget airline"
Belgrade to London. Was charged overweight for one of the suitcases. There were three of us with each having ticket with bag allowance. We ended up having only two suitcases - one 23kg and the other 26kg. We were charged for one suitcase being three kilos over weight limit even though we have not had a third suitcase and the weight of the disputed suitcase was below usual occupational health and safety weight for the airport luggage handlers. Weight limit was not written on the tickets issued at all. We travelled with same suitcase arrangement few days before on different airline using same e-ticket and had no problem. The whole experience was - blink the wrong way and you'll be charged. Previous customers were telling us that you may get charged if you have not done internet check in - well I was not sent a link to do it and somehow we did not ended up being charged for it. The seats are a bit better than in your local park but do not expect much comfort. The plane seemed quite new and the flight was smooth but for the price of the tickets paid the experience was way below any budget airline I ever used and this airline is not advertised as a budget airline for the start.

### "worst traveling experience"
Zurich to Beirut via Belgrade. My worst traveling experience ever. Spent two days traveling from a country to another all because of heavy rain in Serbia. First my flight was delayed (1h30m) from Zurich to Serbia and when we arrived to Serbia my connection flight to Beirut left and they postponed my flight for 2 days and send me to Greece only to be told that I don't have a ticket to Beirut.I don't recommend taking a flight with this airline.

### "Disastrous experience"
Brussels to Belgrade. Low cost airline with insanely expensive tickets. Flag-carrier without a single reason. No free check-in at the airport, no free seat selection at online check-in, no free food, no free beverages, flight delayed, passengers who completed online check-in could not board and had to have their boarding tickets re-issued at the gate. Disastrous experience.

### "not even a glass of water"
I paid 300EUR to fly Thessaloniki to Moscow via Belgrade. The return was a trip of more than 14 hours duration together with the stop, and I could not be offered even a glass of water. The fare is not corresponds to a non low cost company, except if they decided to change the type of the airline. Seats were comfortable and clean. But they had already deactivated the multimedia smartphone entertainment system which was offered a year before without to provide any other option.

### "a very poor airline nowadays"
Moscow to Amsterdam via Belgrade. Got the Air Serbia tickets because they were very cheap. I must say that I took Air Serbia flights many times in the past, and the airline has become a shadow of its former glory. First (around 2014-5) they used to serve hot meals in economy with real cutlery and a vast selection of drinks, including liquors and wines. I couldn't recommend them enough back then. Then (around 2016) they got rid of printed menus and real cutlery, but the experience was still nice. Then (around 2017) they got rid of liquors and hot meals, replacing them all with a small sandwich. And now let's talk about these flights. Moscow-Belgrade. A jam-packed A319, but the seat pitch is, honestly, great. I am 195 cm tall and I was very comfortable in these slimline seats. Nothing was free onboard, not even water (2 EUR for a small bottle). You also have to pay for the seat selection, but if the system grants you a poor one, you apparently can ask the check-in staff to change it for no extra charge. The connection (only 40 minutes) was hectic, with no assistance from Air Serbia staff, and I almost missed my next flight, getting on when the sign said "Gate closed". Belgrade-Amsterdam. A full A319, the onboard experience was pretty much the same. Amsterdam-Belgrade was delayed for almost 3 hours without any explanation or a single apology, which was very disappointing and left a bitter taste. The cabin crew seemed clueless and, honestly, were quite rude, which I never experienced with Air Serbia. Otherwise, a half-full flight made for a comfortable journey. I had to wait for my luggage for over 30 minutes, but surprisingly it made it, despite the short connection. So that is a plus. Belgrade-Moscow. A semi-full A319, where I ended up with a row to myself, was also delayed for 2 hours without any apologies or explanation. The cabin crew were so awful, I couldn't believe it. First, the flight had no business class passengers, and the seating is identical, so the whole plane was all-economy. When I left my second-row seat to use the forward restroom, the crew told me to go to the back of the plane for whatever reason. Then they closed the curtains (the first row had no passengers) and had a very loud "party" right in the first row of the cabin where they had their crew meals, laughed, used the "closed" bathroom and just had a very pleasant time with no concern for the passengers. I found it to be disgusting, to be honest, as I've never seen the cabin crew that cared so little about the passengers. Overall, Air Serbia is a very poor airline nowadays, which resembles many low-cost carriers (and not the good ones). The redeeming qualities are their ability to handle short connections (if you can run) and spacious seating, otherwise I find no reason to fly with them ever again.

### "declining on the services"
Athens to Belgrade. Over the course of the past 2 years Air Serbia has been declining on the services it provides. Mid 2016 you could get a ticket for 120-140€ (with return) with the ability to choose your seat, 23KG included and meal/beverages. During 2017 the price increased to 140-170€ while the ability to choose your seat was removed. This year, the prices went up to 145-150€ (initial) and does not include any of the original services. No luggage, no food & beverage nor the ability to choose your seat for free. Eventually to have only a 23kg bag (not food or pick your seat), you got to pay between 185-200€. Thats 52% price increase without 2/3 of the services being completely cut. When I tried to complain to the ground service (ticket sales / check in) the staff didn't comment and asked me to leave a complain on their website. 2+ Months later and no response obviously.

### "I am completely unimpressed"
I am completely unimpressed with Air Serbia. Everything about this airline is like a low cost carrier except the fares, which are quite high! Nothing onboard is complimentary - not even water. In addition to being expensive, service onboard was slow and the menu options unappealing. (The coffee was just awful). Preboarding for families with infants doesn't exist, and luggage limits are ungenerous and strict. Customer service lines at the Belgrade airport don't connect, and online customer service was unhelpful, referring us only to the same numbers that don't work. I have heard Air Serbia used to be a decent full-service airline but no longer. This airline is truly for the birds.

### "they act as a low cost airline"
2 years ago, I would have recommended Air Serbia to anyone. You got a complimentary hot meal and drink, reasonable prices and friendly cabin crew. Recently the airline has taken a change for the worse. The prices are very high and do not reflect what you receive during the flight. Like a low cost airline, food is only given to those who pay extra so very unprofessionally (for a supposedly high cost airline) only half the passengers eat food. Not even complimentary water is given to passengers. Furthermore the cabin crew seemed to have no idea what they were doing. They were impolite and struggled to hand out food, to those who paid extra. As a partner of Etihad Airways you would expect great reception and hospitality. The prices are high but in reality they act as a low cost airline. Wizz Air does the exact flight for a lot cheaper and still I bet I will enjoy the flight more.

### "there is no free food"
Belgrade to Milan. Terrible service, too expensive, strange rules for cabin bags, rude employees, bad organization. In airplane there is no free food even when you pay for bought bags.

### "unfriendly und intolerant staff"
Flew Air Serbia from Belgrade to Paris. Terrible service at the airport check in and security check. Very unfriendly und intolerant staff. There is no flexibility about the exact weight and size of the suitcase and hand luggage. If you can avoid this airline, be sure to fly with another company.

### "Spotless flight attendants"
Prior to my very first flight with Air Serbia from Copenhagen to Belgrade late February 2018, I visited this website to set my expectations. Upon check-in was assigned the seat in row 13 which the vast majority of the Airlines do not use. After minor delay boarded clean Airbus 319 with retrofitted Recaro seats and plenty of legroom. Spotless flight attendants and free sandwich and beverages, including beer and wine. Flight was smooth and eventless. All the crew spoke good English. Would recommend this Airline to others. Yes, they ruined my checked-in luggage, but that's probably due to ground handling.

### "than terrible, terrible service"
I don’t know what else to say other than terrible, terrible service. The staff were always rude. Whether at the airport or flying they were not friendly and very hard to communicate with. Our flight was diverted to Toronto as JFK was experiencing a harsh storm. When we landed in Toronto, they would not tell us what the next step was. We waited for hours before we found out anything. No food, no beverage and lack of communication. It’s been weeks and I have yet to track my baggage. Every time I call no one can help. I have to even call internationally and they never answer. The call center in NY does not help at all. Flyers please be aware that this airline company is terrible and does not help customers in any way.

### "Poor service and no in-flight entertainment"
Flew Air Serbia from Abu Dhabi to Ljubljana via Belgrade. Poor service and no in-flight entertainment. Overall my worst experience in an international flight. The quality of meal served in the flight is quite poor as well. The airline requires significant improvement varying from In-flight service, meals provided and customer service.

### "had such a bad service"
Prague to Larnaca via Belgrade. Air Serbia offers special meals, so I took this chance and 24 hours before the flight I chose the raw vegan meal hoping that’s gonna be gluten-free. Standing in front of the check-in desk my friend said that from the two ladies one of them looks like she hates her life so she would like to go to the other one, so I went to this grumpy lady and after my friend had to come too because we were booked together so it would be faster, it took her like 10-15 minutes still but whatever. She told my friend she needs to check in her cabin baggage so I told my friend to take her important stuff out and the lady while she didn’t even look at us through the whole conversation says in an arrogant tone “you leave the baggage outside the aircraft, you get it outside the aircraft, do you understand what I am saying?” we were shocked what is her problem. So after during the first flight to Belgrade the stewardess lady told me to take off my headphones and she walked away, I didn’t really understand for what reason tho. After landing we went to the transfer flights, at the information desk the staff were just chatting instead of helping the passengers. I would like to mention that there was no shop from where I could buy water or anything. So I couldn’t wait to board and get something to drink and get my pre-ordered raw vegan meal. They changed our seats and my friend asked this stewardess woman or whatever she is that why and she was like “because of the balance of the aircraft”. I was starving when I saw them serving the meal. The staff didn’t even look at me gave the sandwiches to the man and to his daughter next to me and wanted to walk away when the man told him he forgot about me. He is with a fake tone “Oh do you want?” I told him I ordered my meal if I could get it, he looks at me disdainfully that he got the vegetarian sandwich if I want. After they came with the drinks this man ignored me again. I don’t know what’s with their attitude and why they have this special meal offer if anyway, they don't care. I have never been treated with such an ignorance and had such a bad service on a plane before.

### "worst flight experience of my life"
Belgrade to Berlin. After a flight has been cancelled due to technical issues, as Air Serbia claimed, we had to wait for more than 5 hours until we got into a hotel, to stay there for less than 5 hours over night to catch the next flight connection. Information about how long the whole procedure would take had not been given. After travelling for more than 19 hours plus about 6 hours (total: 25 hours flight and stopover time) waiting until the original flight departure time, this experience really made my day. Belgrade has a small airport and Air Serbia does not have many flight attendants. So, I can only warn anyone who is planning to have a stopover in Belgrade with Air Serbia to look for alternatives. At least, I will do this in the future, as this was the worst flight experience of my life. After more than 8 weeks I am still waiting for the reimbursement of food expenses, since they took more than 5,5 hours from 6 pm to 11.40 pm to provide a food bag, most of the time, not letting us go for the food counter, promising that we would go to the hotel at any time. Unbelievable.

### "Would surely fly Air Serbia again"
Air Serbia was one of my most positive surprises in the last years. I did not expect much as my flight from Berlin to Tirana was very cheap. However, I was even able to have free checked luggage. All of the planes were clean and not too old, except for the ATR-72, but I still really like this plane. Air Serbia offers free WiFi on their planes and has an Entertainment program using an Air Serbia App with music, some series and movies - haven´t seen this on much other airlines. They even served a small snack on all flights. The crew were by far the most friendly that I have experienced in the last few years. Would surely fly Air Serbia again.

### "This is the worst airline"
London to Podgorica via Belgrade. This is the worst airline I have been flying with. They will do all they can to take from you more money. If you have a choice, pick somebody else. They customer service is awful, those people didn't know if the flight is going to be delayed, they didn't know that it was snowing in London, they didn't know anything. When I arrived at the airport I was told that I didn't check myself in online, which was a lie, because I did. If you have slightly overweight baggage, get ready for additional payment. Not to mention that almost all airplanes are old, seats very uncomfortable.

### "advice to avoid Air Serbia"
Düsseldorf to Belgrade. Air Serbia has to learn about dealing with customers. The policy of cheap flight with hand baggage only is alright. But if you control it too hursh you'll end up punishing your passengers. You do this in order to reduce the overall weight of large luggage, not to traumatize passengers by fining them. This happened to me: for 1.5kg extra they charged me with 60eur. Some other passengers were, however, able to come in without a problem. Formally, the company had right. Morally and according to any other criteria concerning the passenger comfort and reputation — they are wrong. My advice to avoid Air Serbia, they are not the only company.

### "A delightful experience"
A delightful experience on Air Serbia flight from Belgrade to NYC. Quite comfortable seats in the economy class and most helpful crew with smiles, went above and beyond. They assisted passengers with small children, those in need of special assistance and the rest of us requiring the usual drinks, snacks or something related to the entertainment system. I am very happy with Air Serbia and with great ticket cost and frequent specials. Thank you guys.

### "cabin service immaculate"
Flew with Air Serbia from Belgrade to Milan and back a couple of days after. Online check in with hand luggage only. Both flights were on time, cabin clean and neat, cabin service immaculate, friendly and well groomed cabin crew. Food served was sandwich and selection of drinks. Overall, great and professional service, well maintained and cleaned aircraft cabin, friendly and very informative announcments by both captains on both journey legs.

### "Horrible experience"
Berlin to Tel Aviv via Belgrade. Horrible experience! Terrible services and ignorant rules. Our flight was delayed twice for several hours. We did not receive any service or information. I've tried to cancel a return flight, but nobody bothered to rely my messages and emails. When I called, then they just said I should wrote an email.

### "these guys are amateurs"
Belgrade to London. In the last 4 weeks we have flown with Air Serbia 3 times and there have been issues on all 3 flights. Flight 1 Budva to  Skopje via Belgrade our baggage was left behind in Belgrade. Flight 2 Budva to Skopje again our baggage was left behind in Belgrade. The same thing happened to 2 other family members on different flights (same route) and we are now wondering whether Air Serbia ever get the luggage to the destination. Also we are now waiting for Flight 3 and 20 minutes before departure they have quoted operational issues and we are waiting for a new plane to arrive hence being delayed at least an hour. We have also packed essentials into our carry on luggage in case our bags are lost again. Take a different flight, these guys are amateurs.

### "only take carry on!"
Rome to Belgrade on 12 August 2017. Our flight was delayed due to bad weather conditions in Belgrade. When we finally arrived to Belgrade airport, I discovered that they had left my luggage in Rome. About half of the passengers were in the same situation. I was given an email address to contact regarding any type of compensation, because I had to buy at least some clothes and essentian cosmetics (I was left with only clothes I was wearing during the 3-day trip). I wrote two emails, nobody even aknowledged them! As I told them that I had to continue my trip, Air Serbia ground crew told me that they could deliver my luggage only to the "Serbian border" and that I could drive there and pick it up. I had to tell them that they could also send it by one of their flights to other countries where I will be travelling. Finally, I have been assigned a "case number" on 21 August and haven't heard from then again. If you fly with this airline, only take carry on!

### "they lost our luggage"
Larnaca to Prague via Belgrade. Flew several times with them but this time they lost our luggage and after 3 days since we landed, they are unable to deliver it although they had promised to do so the evening on the day we landed. Customer service rarely picks up the phone and their delivery service is rude and did not honor 2 appointments we scheduled with them so far. Three days later we are still waiting for our luggage to be delivered. From terrible to almost nothing that can be regarded as food even though this is not a budget airline. In our last flight they randomly gave to people super tiny cheese or meat sandwiches without asking people what they would like, since they did not have enough of either option for people to choose from (our first leg was over 2 hours long). Bad service on the ground with multiple unnecessary checks of the same documents at different checkpoints (In Belgrade checked passport and boarding card before the gate, at the gate, during x-ray and before getting on the transfer bus!). Service on the air is average at best. Flight attendants are disconnected from passengers with robot-like behavior. To the most part, old planes with worn or slightly broken seats and occasionally broken air-con vents and/or reading lights. Does not worth the stress nor the money. Pay a little bit extra or book your flights earlier and fly with a premium/well-known airline and avoid the hassle.

### "flight itself was quite pleasant"
When I arrived at Ben Gurion airport about 65 minutes before departure, due to traffic jams, the check-in was about to close. However, in the e-mail I had received from Air Serbia it was stated that last check in would be 45 minutes before departure. Staff told me that I was lucky that they would still accept my luggage, which I felt was a bit humilitating. The flight itself was quite pleasant, staff on board were nice and smiling, and the gluten free meal I had ordered arrived promptly. I was a bit surprised to receive only some rice with a few vegetables on the second flight, but still it was ok. Also free beverages were served, and together with a small stay at the calm and pleasant Belgrade airport I found the trip quite good. Compared to other airlines on this route it was above average.

### "great meals and service"
Excellent flight with Air Serbia from New York to Belgrade with an outstanding cabin crew. Great meals and great services were offered with smiles. The airplane was very clean and seats were comfortable for an overnight flight. If great service is what sells an airline to a passenger, then I am surely looking forward to fly again with Air Serbia.

### "indifferent to our situation"
Athens to Frankfurt via Belgrade. Our plane from Athens had a technical problem and we had to disembark from the plane after boarding. Upon reaching the waiting gate again there were no direction at all, and there wasn't any airline representative for the first hour, and no directions or clarifications over the PA. After waiting for 5 hours we were told that our plane was ready for boarding again, but when we boarded the plane and had spent another hour inside, the plane failed to complete its startup sequence and we had to disembark once more. By now it was almost 10pm, and once again there was only chaos once we reached back at the waiting area. We waited for almost an hour before there was any directions. At 1 am they told us that we were getting a hotel, but we were also to go on a 5 am flight, which means that we would probably barely even get two hours worth of sleep as the hotel is far away at the city center. Soon afterwards we also learnt that they have arranged a connection flight from Belgrade, but we have to fly to Berlin first, instead of a direct flight to Frankfurt. Worse, the connection flight is at 6pm the next day, meaning that we were stranded again for 12 hours at Belgrade. We tried to reason for a later, 12pm flight from Athens to Belgrade, so that at least we could get some shut-eye, but we learnt later that all Air Serbia staff at the Athens airport had gone back home! We only reached Frankfurt at 11.30 pm the next day, 26 hours after our scheduled arrival. Throughout the ordeal the Air Serbia management was very callous and they seemed indifferent to our situation. It was impossible to reach their offices and there was very little done with regards to customer care. Air Serbia clearly does not value the welfare of its passengers.

### "horrible service recovery"
Horrible service recovery from Ari Serbia for our flight from Athens to Frankfurt via Belgrade. Flight was at 15:35. It was delayed and right before the plane took off, it returned back to the gate. After some time, we were asked to alight due to technical issues. No information was given on what we should expect. The ground staff were clueless as they receive no news from Air Serbia as well. All passengers were told to wait until 2100 for some news. Those with Frankfurt as their final destination was first told that we would be rerouted with Turkish Airline. After some time, they told us that it was cancelled. Then at 2130 we boarded the plane again, only to wait for an hour until at 2230 we were told to get off the plane again. Then we were split into 2 groups. Group A will get on the 5am flight to Belgrade. Group B will wait for Air Serbia crew to fly to Athens at 2am with spare parts for the plane, then they will wait until an indefinite time until the plane is fixed. We were given hotel vouchers which were only issued at 130am. The hotel was at city centre (30 mins away) as those near airport are full. It doesn't make sense as we would have to back by 3am to check in again. So most passengers did not claim it. The flight to Frankfurt was finally settled, but we had to wait in Belgrade for 12 hours from 6am to 6pm. So we couldn't have any sleep. And we had to take an extra flight from Belgrade to Berlin first, then to Frankfurt. All of us wasted more than 1 full day. They could have reached a decision to send us to the hotel much earlier so at least we could sleep even if we have to catch a 5am flight the next day. The communication could've been a lot better too. In the end, all we were compensated with was a 20 euro voucher for food for the amount of hassle and time we wasted. Clearly, Air Serbia did not value our time. Would not recommend this airline.

### "great and very smooth flight"
Belgrade to Athens on a full aircraft. Ticket booked with Aegean Airlines operated by Air Serbia. Did not bother to do online check in, as I did not have easy access to a printer and check in at the desk was free (although from now on the cheapest category tickets will not have free airport desk check in). Employees very friendly and helpful. Some lines at the airport, however did not wait long. Belgrade Airport might be small and somewhat old, however I did find it is comfortable and easy as everything is at short distance and lines were at a minimum. Security check was after passport control and seperate for each gate. Orderly and quick embarkation. Bridge used at both airports. Take off and landing on time. Very minimal sandwich and drink offered for free (including some nice wine). Crew immaculate, cheerful and friendly. On arrival baggage was retrieved really fast. They have some kind of wifi/entertainment system, but did not try it out. Only thing that could be better is the size of the sandwich (Aegean/Olympic offer a bit more food on that route). Also they have started to charge for the selection of seats. All in all a great and very smooth flight.

### "staff are very professional"
I usually fly with Wizz Air, however, whenever I have the opportunity I fly with Air Serbia (they fly during the mornings) Copenhagen to Belgrade. The staff are very professional and they seem to really enjoy their job. The airplanes are clean on the inside and outside. Pilots always appreciated and informative. Nice music during boarding and when waiting to taxi. The Air Serbia brand is by the way very good looking. Normal leg space. Food and drink for a 1h 50m flight nothing I expected, but nevertheless got served. Very nice. No inflight entertainment on short haul, but who cares and who expects that? Will definitely try out Air Serbia bound for New York when I get the chance.

### "a bit disappointed"
Belgrade to London Heathrow. A bit disappointed with Air Serbia - my seat was changed at the very last minute (as I boarded) from an aisle seat to a window seat despite having gone through three separate checks prior with no mention. I asked the cabin crew and gate staff to help me find another aisle seat and they simply shrugged back at me. Air conditioning on the plane was temperamental to say the least so the aircraft got very hot. A full meal service despite it being a mid morning flight. Flight landed early.

### "seats were comfortable"
Air Serbia ground staff at Belgrade airport extremely rude and arrogant - I don't think they understand basic customer service. Plane from Belgrade to Abu Dhabi was A319 and although flight was over 5 hours there was not any kind of inflight entertainment or screen showing the flight path. On the positive side, seats were comfortable with ample leg space.

### "plane was very comfortable"
❎ Unverified |  JU174 from Belgrade to Podgorica on one of Air Serbia's 737's in immaculate condition. The plane was very comfortable, legroom more than sufficient (I'm 191cm) albeit a service limited for a short flight, wet towels would have been much appreciated. Belgrade is a very pleasant airport to depart from with few or no queues, well organized and clean. For all those interested, there is a railway station in Podgorica with trains departing every 1h30 approximately 10 min walk from the terminal, much cheaper and more original option than the taxi.

### "nice full-service airline"
Moscow Sheremetyevo to Athens via Belgrade return in economy, the price was very low. The planes were quite new, seats were not very spacious, but ok for short flights. Cabin crew ranged from neutral to extremely well-mannered and smiling. Meals were sufficient and tasty: hot meal on Moscow flights, sandwich and an apple on flights to/from Athens. Having a real menu card in economy class on longer flights, such as Moscow, is a really nice touch, as well as offering a complimentary bar service including spirits. What I noticed is that they have recently changed their classy metal cutlery to cheap plastic one, which is sad. All flights were slightly delayed. What I appreciated is that Air Serbia managed to organize my very extremely short 45 minutes connection in Belgrade (which came out to be 30 minutes because of the delay) perfectly, without any rush, and my luggage arrived intact and on-time as well. Belgrade Airport was pleasant and calm, a pleasure to transit through. Air Serbia really needs to fix up their website, though, as the interface for seat and meal selection is simply unacceptable. Overall, Air Serbia is a very nice full-service airline, and I will gladly travel with them again for the right price.

### "cabin crew very attentive"
Flew Air Serbia from Belgrade to Rome. Cabin crew very attentive, welcome drinks, nuts, a hot meal, towels provided twice, everything for a little over an hour trip. Good leather seats.

### "one of my worst experiences"
Paris to Thessaloniki via Belgrade. I fly a couple times a year, and my experience with Air Serbia was one of my worst experiences with customer service. Me and my travel companion's flight out of CDG was delayed so they canceled our connecting flight out of Belgrade to Thessaloniki. They then re-booked us on different flights to get to our destination. This is all part of air travel and honestly doesn't bother me. They didn't let us collect our baggage, split me and my travel companion up (we were rushed after we protested) to be on separate flights and delayed our baggage. My luggage arrived after 3 days. I asked for a receipt when it arrived, but was given nothing, so I cannot receive a reimbursement through my travel insurance for delayed baggage. My travel companion's baggage is still delayed 6 days now and we continue to be provided with no information. The Air Serbia staff at Paris CDG were rude, not able to provide clear instructions, have not answered any inquires about delayed baggage, and knowingly split up two people traveling together. Flight delays, lost/delayed baggage, etc. are all part of air travel, the way Air Serbia treats its customers is far from the norm and I will not be flying with them or recommending them to anyone.

### "24 hour delay"
24 hour delay on route CDG-BEG-SOF - Thank you Air Serbia! The flight from CDG to BEG was delayed 60 min due to late arrival of the plane from BEG. During the flight, the captain informed connecting passengers about the gates for other connecting flights, but not ours. It turned out when we landed, that the plane for SOF had just departed, leaving around 15 miserable passengers on the ground, facing the bored ground staff of Air Serbia. You can fly for SOF in 24h, there is no any other way". Simple as that. Yes, they provided a hotel, food and transfer, but I could not believe it is possible nowadays for an "Airline" to leave you with a 24h delay, when there is nothing abnormal, like weather conditions or a strike.

### "poor cabin crew service"
London to Belgrade. Poor cabin crew service! The flight was almost full and most of the passengers obviously carried more than one cabin bag, so space for luggage above my seat was full. Instead of helping me to find space for my bag and jacket, a member of cabin staff told me to keep it under my seat. Later I found enough space above the seat two rows in front of mine. This shows that the staff does not take enough care and it's unacceptable to have an uncomfortable 3-hour flight that I paid about 500€! This is not a low cost airline and their service is quite expensive, therefore they should make sure all passengers have enough comfort! Or at least try to help!

### "staff are excellent"
Belgrade to Brussels. You may think that a relatively small country like Serbia would have a basic airline however, the business class in my opinion is far better than any other European airline. The A319 is a small aircraft but the business class feels very spacious. Air Serbia use two seats instead of leaving the third seat in place. The choice of food and drinks are good quality. The staff are excellent and are only to happy to help, they even offered me an iPad to watch movies when my laptop ran out of battery. I've travelled with Air Serbia several times in economy, for flights over 2hrs a choice of food is available and drinks, alcoholic and soft. The 'elevate' app and free wifi make this airline a pleasure to travel on. You can also upgrade to business class in the airport to lots of destinations for around 110€. Take note larger European carriers

### "lots of room for improvement"
Belgrade to Malta return, the aircraft advertised was the A319 - however we were ushered in an ancient Aviolet (Air Serbia charter division) Boeing 737-300 inherited from Yugoslav Airlines which was a huge disappointment. Some half-hearted attempts have been made to make the really old cabin interior look a little more up to date, but not much. Another, slightly better preserved 737 flew us back to Belgrade. The boarding process in Belgrade was smooth as the flight was half-empty but a nightmare on return when it was full - it took ages to check in, however both flights took off with only minor delays. Some cabin crew members looked a bit surly, others on the other hand had an attitude which could best be described as overfamiliar. In both directions we were offered a miniscule, taste-free chicken sandwich - two bites and it's gone - and a very dry, hardened cookie for a meal. The return flight arrived at the remotest gate possible, the one habitually used by low cost carriers - even though there were loads of other empty gates - hardly any aircraft around at the time in fact. There was a considerable delay in delivering the luggage. All in all, the flight experience was bland and forgettable, with lots of room for further improvement, but generally on par with what's today being offered by most European legacy carriers in economy class.

### "8 hour delay, no comunication"
Bucharest to Prague via Belgrade with Air Serbia. 8 hour delay and no comunication. We have to stay in the airport until they reroute us but only after 8 hours. Bad attitude at the airport and by email. I will never fly again with this company.

### "flights were on time"
My first flights with Air Serbia, I was impressed. Both flights were on time, the crew were very welcoming and food pretty good (a choice between London and Belgrade). It was standard seating for economy class, not particularly comfortable but fine for a short flight. The overall impression was of a well managed airline with good staff. I had an overnight stop in Belgrade which worked well, the airport is efficient and easy to use, no queues. Transport into the city was regular and very good value. One of my better flight experiences of recent years and I would recommend Air Serbia to others.

### "cheerful and attentive"
Belgrade to Paris CDG. I was pleasantly surprised by the stark difference between JAT and Air Serbia. The aircraft was new and clean. The ground staff was efficient and the crew onboard was exceptionally cheerful and attentive. As an economy passenger, even a menu with an actual meal and drink selection was included. Although it was my first and only flight with the newly-branded Air Serbia to date, I was impressed enough to say that Air Serbia is one of the best airlines I have flown.

### "seats hardly recline"
Belgrade to Abu Dhabi. Although the difference to the defunct JAT is enormous, the business class (2 rows of 24 seats each) is very low-class and only be classified as economy deluxe; in the first row, it is not even possible to stretch legs completely. Seats hardly recline. Food was good, flight attendants very friendly, wines good, and the amenity kit ok, even for the day flight between Abu Dhabi to Belgrade. Pity, with some small upgrading, it could be excellent. Inflight entertainment with your own iPad (if you have downloaded the special software beforehand) or with Air Serbia's iPads

### "with unacceptable attitude"
Ljubljana to Thessaloniki via Belgrade. Horrible experience. After take off we returned back to Ljubljana airport due to technical problem. It can happen, with their ATR72 aircrafts it can happen quite frequently. They are old, extremely loud and with really tired cabin. At the airport no information at all, no Air Serbia representative at the airport, nothing. Later Air Serbia representative even refused to talk to the passengers. For the Air Serbia representative in Ljubljana you do not exist, you are not a real person, not a customer. Totally unprofessional and unacceptable! After more than 3 hours we departed and all passengers with connected flight missed the midday connections, had to be rebooked to the night flights or Air Serbia flights next day. Arrived in Thessaloniki at 03:00 instead of 15:25 previous day and had to start working just a few hours after arrival. Flight back nothing to write about. Maybe the most interesting thing was the conversation with the flight attendant on a flight back to Ljubljana. She mentioned that we were quite lucky since we returned to the airport just once. When she was last time on a flight form Ljubljana to Belgrade they had to return twice. Do not be fooled, they are not really “new wings of Europe”, just the same repainted old JAT Airways with unacceptable attitude towards their passengers.

### "friendly service"
Good experience overall flying from Tel Aviv to Belgrade. Friendly service, seat pitch limited but not inferior to competitors on this route, full meal served, including drinks, which is far above the standard for European routes to TLV. Would certainly recommend Air Serbia. Flight left and arrived on time.

### "unforgettable experience"
My wife and I had an excellent experience with Air Serbia. We were treated with kindness, respect, and unprecedented customer service. The crew attention to detail is impressive: from making sure our headphones were working to ensuring we were satisfied with our meals to offering an extra blanket. Despite being one of the smaller airlines, their professionalism and integrity is excellent. Thank you for the unforgettable experience.

### "crew very courteous and attentive"
Belgrade to Athens with Air Serbia. This was without a doubt, one of the best experiences on a European flight. The check-in agent was very polite and helpful. I later tried the Air Serbia premium lounge, which puts any other European airline to shame. The catering was excellent, with plenty of choices of hot and cold food. The staff were always present. The flight was excellent. The seats were comfortable, with pillows and blankets available. The hot meal was superb for such a short flight. The cabin crew very courteous and attentive. Overall, an excellent experience. Will definitely use them in the future.

### "crew gave a professional impression"
Belgrade to Stockholm with Air Serbia. Good and helpful check-in. Good food - a choice between two different menus with free drinks. The plane was fresh and new and the crew gave a professional impression. I really recommend paying a little more to go with Air Serbia than going with the low cost companies. The price in the end will be the same and you get more value for the money.

### "same bad experience on return "
London to Belgrade return. The Check-In at London Heathrow T4 was too long. just 2 staff one for business and one for Drop off/check-in. The boarding process was a mess, looks like a Low cost company. They board us to the channel and we had to wait 10/15 min to board the flight. Inside the aircraft was hot and the aircon wasn't working until the engine starts. The seats are as standard seats for short/medium flights. Nothing to say for the multimedia and Internet connection. Is the only thing I liked during the all flight. The quality of the food is very poor. I think it wasn't worth the price we paid for a return ticket to Belgrade. Same bad experience on the return flight.

### "never choose Air Serbia in future"
Thessaloniki to Dusseldorf via Belgrade. First of all electronic check-in is not available. You have to go to the airport to check-in. Anyway we did that. At the boarding pass and at all the screens the boarding time was 04:35, but the airline desided to leave earlier and started to make last call announcements for me and my wife from 04:15! I had to leave our car to the parking and I hadn't yet returned, but my wife was at the airport and they threatened her that the aircraft will leave without us! At 04:25 we were at the gate and they were yelling at us for being late. But according to the boarding pass the boarding hadn't started yet. We were in our seats after literally 2 minutes and the plane departed, almost half an hour early. How is this possible? The food was good, but useless if you lose your flight although you are not late. I will never choose Air Serbia in the future.

### "kind and helpful flight attendants"
Athens to Belgrade with Air Serbia. Seamless check in, kind airport staff, relatively comfortable seats. Clean and well designed cabin, kind and helpful flight attendants. Professional and informative pilot / flight deck info provided. Amazing food for this relatively short flight.

### "love the service on Air Serbia"
Amsterdam to Tivat via Belgrade with Air Serbia. Another great experience with AS. I have to say one of the best airlines I have taken recently. All flights left almost on time. The flight crew is professional, well presented, super friendly and helpful. The aircraft were clean and they offer lots of legroom, WiFi was perfect from AMS to BEG. Pilots were giving us updates prior to take off and landing (which is great as well). Food was served on all 3 flights even the to Tivat which was only 35 minutes long - again amazed by that. As I live in Canada we do not get anything in North America even if you fly for 9 hrs and they charge us crazy prices. Luggage was delivered on time and everything went smooth at the Belgrade airport. Again, love the service on AS and hope they keep it up.

### "don't get fooled by low price"
My Air Serbia plane was delayed in Paris for one hour on which I missed my transit flight from Belgrade to Beirut. Around 20 passengers were stuck until next flight which happened to be in 24 hours. Air Serbia sent us unguided to different hotels letting us discuss with the hotels representative on getting a room or not. It seems the airline has frequent similar delays where all passengers are sent to these two hotels. Accodomodation and food is below average. They just provided us with one dish of chicken and water. We had to pay anything on top of that. Among the people in the group some had their luggage lost and sent two days later on departure. Avoid cabin food they offer. Onboard entertainment is linked to your ipad or smarphone after installing their app. All that without any power plug for recharging. In summary, don't get fooled by the low price. It's not worth it.

### "crew attentive and polite"
Tel Aviv to Moscow via Belgrade with Air Serbia. Service was good and crew attentive and polite. The food is nice and some things were quite surprisingly tasty. We flew 4 flights and every flight departed late. The call center is nice and helpful. We has an issue with change of flight dates and times and the girl in the call center helped very much. The fare was very cheap.

### "unprofessional handling of a delay"
Amsterdam to Belgrade with Air Serbia. This was the most unprofessional handling of a delay ever. I accept that delays are possible but due to some technical issue we had to wait for 2 hours in the plane and afterwards for another 3 in the airport. Information about the status was not given at all. The flight even disappeared from the screens. We eventually had a new departure time 15.30 (9.55 origin). We were put on to busses for boarding and then had to disembark again as there in no personal available from Air Serbia. We are not even in the air yet, and it is easily a most horrible flight.

### "fares can be really good"
I've flown Air Serbia more than ten times on shorter flights Belgrade to Prague or Belgrade to Tel Aviv or Paris. The seats are comfortable and reasonably spacious. Food ranges from amazing to okay. Drinks are served on every flight. The cabin crew are professional and polite. No TV or other entertainment is provided onboard, but you can purchase the internet access or make calls (on some flights). I haven't really experienced any delays. They run specials to different destinations every Friday, Saturday and Sunday and the fares can be really good. The value for money is excellent.

### "helpful cabin crew"
This was my second flight with Air Serbia within two days and pleased with their Business Class service from Belgrade to Paris CDG. Flawless check-in and a stunning premium lounge. We departed with a slight delay from BEG caused by atrocious weather at CDG and landed with just a 30 mins delay. Very nice, courteous and helpful cabin crew, clean cabin and tasty omelette. They offer onboard WiFi service and GSM phone service so you can use your mobile phone. I am looking forward to try their transatlantic BEG-JFK service when launched.

### "efficient and with a smile"
This was my first flight on Air Serbia, a very short route serviced by ATR-72 but it was flawless from check-in to an on-time arrival. Fast, efficient and with a smile. Economy class and surprised to see a tasty sandwich and mineral water offered free of charge on a flight which would be considered a shuttle service in the US.

### "ATR aircraft old, tired and loud"
Short flights from Ljubljana to Sarajevo via Belgrade and back. ATR aircraft look old and tired, extremely loud, nothing like modern turboprop aircrafts. I actually like turboprops for such short flights, nevertheless not at all an old and loud ones like Air Serbia. Catering a small bottle of water and even smaller sandwich. I do not expect much on intra-European flights, would be better to have the option to by something of a good quality than a sandwich of substandard quality. Most passengers just returned it unpacked, so pure waste of food. All flights on time, flight attendants nice and professional. Belgrade airport is not the best transfer airport, crowded at peak time and with extremely unpleasant and even rude staff, especially on the security controls.

### "food was average"
Air Serbia in general have great business class sections and very nice staff and the flight to Stockholm from Belgrade on 18 February was no exception. The staff were wonderful and friendly. However, they seem to have gone a bit cheap on food and drinks. The food was average, at best, and the white wine is now of a brand (although not bad) that is not in the high class segment. Champagne before take off still offered. The total product is still very good for being a intra Europe flight but considering the higher standard on food and drinks before its sad to see the quality go down. Return flight from Copenhagen to Belgrade 21 February gave the same impression. Nice staff, bland food and drinks.

### "seats were reasonably comfortable"
For the four times I have flown with Air Serbia from Belgrade to Brussels, the flight has been delayed 3 times (usually 30 minutes). I can't say too much about the ground service since I haven't had any special problems. The cabin crew was pretty nice and professional and the seats were reasonably comfortable. The announced 3-course meal appeared extremely poor and not even enough to be considered a snack. Except for the interesting departure hours and reachable airports, this airline is actually no better than low-cost companies like Wizzair.

### "are always late"
Belgrade to Brussels with Air Serbia. Having short distance flights, early in the morning with no crowd at all and they are always late! Of course, when you reach your destination or transfer, you are on your own to solve problems that they caused with their inefficiency. Good luck to new travelers that don't know foreign languages, because when you depend on Air Serbia you really need some good people out there. I have nothing bad to say for cabin crew.

### "no excuse or explanation"
Belgrade to Copenhagen with Air Serbia. We boarded on time, but then with no explanation we have been waiting, as the late passangers started arriving and this went on for 25 minutes after the scheduled flight time. All in all 40 minutes delay, with no excuse or explanation. This made me miss my train, and I had to wait 2.5 hours for new one, plus had to buy new ticket. Cabin staff were kind, but they were all the time in the aisles with carts, what made it difficult to pass through to toilets and return to the seat.

### "attendants were polite"
Moscow to Belgrade with Air Serbia. The flight attendants were polite, seating was quite comfortable. The meal service was a highlight with printed menus as well as complimentary wines and spirits. They provide metal cutlery which is a nice touch. Planes were in good condition, and flights were on-time. Belgrade airport left a positive impression as well, no real problems.

### "a delightful flight"
The only passenger in Business class from Tel Aviv to Belgrade, and served by a wonderful purser and her colleague. Served champagne before take off and more with hot nuts after departure. A good lunch and excellent wines were offered. Staff couldn't have been friendlier and more service minded. A delightful flight with cheerful staff.

### "seats were comfortable"
I took a flight from IST to WAW via Belgrade with Air Serbia. The Business class section was separated with a curtain. The seats were comfortable. The staff on both flights were extremely warm and helpful. They had me try different Serbian food and drinks. I couldn't believe that I'd bought a business class ticket with that amount of money. Really pleasant experience.

### "fares tend to be quite steep"
Air Serbia from Amsterdam to Belgrade. Polite crew, comfortable seats though the fake leather covers are not the most sensible and get sticky after some time. Complimentary meal was adequate though smaller since the last time I flew them a year ago. Crew friendly, no real faults to point out except the fares tend to be quite steep for a 2 hour flight - but they have a monopoly on this route from Amsterdam. A double daily flight week-round would make the product more appealing. Currently, it simply is not very convenient on most days with a single daily flight.

### "some of the shine worn off"
Air Serbia ticket prices have been hiked recently to the point 1.5 hour flights (Milan) now costs the same as a 3 hour flight last year (London). At the same time some, but not all, of the shine has worn off. While the cabin staff remains impeccable, meals had been reduced to a bun with some cucumber. Aircraft are nice and there is Wi-Fi across most of the Airbus fleet but there is no IFE. Wi-Fi however offers only a limited access of 20mb per voucher. Seats are comfortable and there is plenty of leg room for an average person. Overall I would recommend this airline but keep in mind that the high level of service that was advertised when they started flying is no longer at the same level.

### "seats extremely comfortable"
Visited the newly opened Air Serbia Premium lounge at Belgrade airport, had a freshly squeezed orange juice and very good macchiato. The seats in business class were extremely comfortable with a footrest. Pillow and blanket on the seat. Champagne boarding drink, nuts and hot towels. Tasty breakfast was served with real cutlery, champagne on demand. I was given a tablet which had a large selection of movies, music and games. Impeccable service from cabin crew, flight on time.

### "not come back to this airline"
Air Serbia cancelled my prebooked flight with no other explanation except "we are sorry but the flight got cancelled" email. After 2 months in the booking that is what happened and after I asked them what do they offer to people that have business meeting on that flight (that they have already paid for in full as airline asked) their response was we can give refund in full (which on a return ticket is 45% of a one way ticket) or book you another flight later. When contacted the airline asking them if they can arrange something with some other airline so I can reach my connection flight I was told they don't do that. Only due to a call center agent who managed to book me another flight day before (I had to wait for the connection flight for 17 hours). On top of that when the flight I was booked was delayed for one hour and a half due changing the planes. When they realized that they can squeeze us like sardines in this A319 a very dingy plane. Flight attendants were profesional and pleasant. Terrible experiance and will not come back to this airline unless forced by circumstances.

### "business class seats are comfortable"
Boarding at Heathrow was simple with the gate just opposite the lounge. Moreover, despite an almost full plane, we pushed back 15 minutes early. Business class seats are comfortable with wide seats, a foot rest and three levels of recline - a far cry from simply an economy seat with an empty seat beside, seen on so many short haul business class sections. I was offered a glass of champagne and a menu after boarding, and after take off my lunch order was taken. I was also offered use of an iPad for entertainment. Lunch was of good quality with three good courses. Overall the service from the cabin crew was both smart and friendly.

### "friendly and polite staff"
Paris to Sarajevo via Belgrade on Air Serbia. Friendly and polite staff, delicious food, comfortable seats. For me Air Serbia has the best price, food and staff, and I am very satisfied.

### "were my best flights"
Travelled on Air Serbia from Thessaloniki to Copenhagen via Belgrade and they were my best flights. Cabin crew was very helpful and friendly and the food was very delicious. Absolutely perfect.

### "delicious Serbian Baklava served"
Travelled from Air Serbia from Larnaca to London via Belgrade. Check in was a breeze, the lounge at LCA operated by Swissport which was well stocked with snacks and drinks and plenty of seating. Also, an outside terrace which was nice. Seats on A319 were comfortable and the service professional and courteous. Served a choice of drinks and food was excellent. Lounge facilities in Belgrade were excellent, with a buffet spread that was delicious. Would fly this airline again. Delicious Serbian Baklava was served on the flight.

### "Air Serbia didn't want to help us"
We were flying Air Serbia from Stockholm to Beirut via Belgrade. We had to wait 1.5 hours after our scheduled departure time from Stockholm with no info at all! Instead of sending us from Belgrade to Beirut they fly us from Belgrade to Athens. Our arrival time to Beirut should be at 03.00 but we were stuck in Athens till 11.00, and no one knew about our case in Athens! We had to spend the night on metal chairs instead of being in our bed because Air Serbia denied to provide accommodation or entrance to a lounge. I wanted to pay for the lounge entrance but they denied me that because I couldn't enter without a boarding ticket! And the boarding ticket was not available until 09.00. Air Serbia didn't want to help us or make it easier for us, even though it's own fault that we were stuck in Athens - the only thing they gave us is breakfast vouchers. Our luggage didn't arrive with us so I had to lose time of my vacation to go the next day and pick it up from the airport. On my trip back home we flew from Beirut with a 40 minutes delay and our luggage was again delayed. My luggage was sent home after 3 days. Terrible experience and service from Air Serbia. I was so surprised when I found out that Etihad Airways is the owner of Air Serbia.

### "sandwich and water on short flight"
Flew in economy class on Air Serbia  ATR plane from SKP to BEG. Old plane, very loud music on board during the boarding process. Seats old but still comfortable. Staff speak bad english but are friendly. Flight delayed by 25 minutes in BEG, but departed on time in SKP. Not a very good calculation from the flight time. Service very good - a sandwich and a small water on this short flight. Very good and a lot of information given by the captain.

### "Crew well groomed and friendly"
Return trip on Air Serbia from Amsterdam to Varna via Belgrade. Outbound paid upgrade to business class. Air Serbia offers a real business class seat,  offer a good meal with 2 options. A welcome drink and option for use of an ipad. In Amsterdam they use the KLM crown Lounge. Transfer to VAR was easy as Belgrade is a small airport. Return was on ATR and A319 in Economy - on both flights a snack or hot meal was offered. Breakfast ex BEG with 2 choices and a menu card. Seating in economy is rather tight and no entertainment (eg they operate longer flights to AUH, TLV, BEY) - okay for short flight but less for a longer flight. Free drinks incl alcohol. Crew well groomed and friendly, flights all pretty full. Not all miles credited yet.

### "friendly service, decent food"
I read earlier reviews and loaded tablet with movies. Previous reviewers are correct, there is no IFE on this service from Belgrade to Abu Dhabi. The flight is just on 5 hours, so long enough to get bored. The food was ok, and matched with most other airlines. I did find it interesting when the safety demonstration was taking place when we were on the runway, it seemed as if the air crew had to speed through the demo as the pilots were waiting for the green light to take off. The lights were also interesting, the darkest flight I have ever been on, only the exit signs were visible - maybe that's just because I was one of the few people on the flight with a screen watching movies? Friendly service, decent food and an on-time performance.

### Air Serbia customer review
I was a bit shocked to find no TV screens. I guess we've come to expect them on longer flights. My flight from Belgrade to Abu Dhabi was more than four hours, long enough to get very bored without a film. Staff were however very friendly and food was quite good and free.

### Air Serbia customer review
I was a passenger on flights JU 523 and JU 414 on 12/08/15. I was satisfied with this airline because it offers high quality services at good prices. The crew were helpful, friendly and communicative. The food was excellent and I recommend choosing the traditional serbian snacks and drinks. Furthermore, food and drinks (beverages, coffee, tea and alcohol) are included in the price. Even though there was a small delay in the transit flight, there was no delay on the arrival time.

### Air Serbia customer review
Both flights were on time. SKG-BEG a sandwich, a small bottle of water and tea/coffee. BEG-DUS we got a salad, beef or chicken meal and could choose soft drinks and alcoholic beverages.

### Air Serbia customer review
Charter flight (Belgrade to Zakynthos). Check-in was smooth and fast, same experience at the gate during boarding process. Aircraft was an older 737 but nicely refurbished inside (comfortable seats and lots of legroom). Flight departed on time where shortly after take off breakfast was served (which was a surprise to us coming from North America, as even on our scheduled flight in Canada we do not get anything). Tasty Serbian food with drinks and coffee. Pilot made a few announcements during the flight informing us about the weather and current position of the aircraft. Overall I was impressed with the service.

### Air Serbia customer review
Staff professional and impeccable service during the flight. Very tasty food served, 3 announcements were made by the cockpit during the flight. Landed in Belgrade with a minor 15-20 min delay. The only negative would be that during boarding there was no priority boarding call and no express boarding line for business passengers.

### Air Serbia customer review
We arrived late to Belgrade and had 20 minutes until our next flight. Everything was organised and Air Serbia managed to get our bags on time all the way to Beirut. Exceeded my expectations. Great flight, friendly staff.

### Air Serbia customer review
Took an evening flight with Air Serbia from Vienna to Bucharest via Belgrade. The flight was in a relatively small turbo-prop aircraft. I had a seat on the front with no one next to me, I also had about half a metre of leg space which was brilliant. Cabin crew very friendly and talkative, as it was a short hop I ended up talking with one of the stewardesses and a man on the opposite row about travel/politics for the entire flights. I would fly again.

### Air Serbia customer review
Copenhagen-Belgrade-Thessaloniki 14th June. Smooth flights with good service. On first leg, three course menu. Beverages, wine and beer for free. Second leg under 1 hour, they served a baguette and drinks. Clean planens on both legs and good information from cockpit. Seat pitch ok, standard.

### Air Serbia customer review
It was a very nice flight with no delays from either Sofia and Belgrade. Decent airplanes with polite staff. Good food on board but lack of inflight entertainment. Not much space for legs but for short flights so it's not such a problem. Good airline.

### Air Serbia customer review
TLV-BEG-AMS-BEG-TLV in May 2015. All flights operated by A319 last segment BEG-TLV by Aviolet B737-300. The highlight of this airline is the crew. Very friendly and nothing is too much trouble. Smiles all around and good grooming. Seating is very tight no legroom and if no empty seat next to you its torture. No IFE of any sort. Food described as "Gourmet" in their literature. Gourmet is the last word that can describe their food. Very basic more like hospital food but their fares are very good so any amenities are a plus. Staff in BEG were kind as well. Flight from/to AMS late an hour each way but that's possible with any airline. All in all a good airline good rates but luckily most of their flights are short (2.5hr max) so the tight seating is manageable.

### Air Serbia customer review
I wanted to reschedule my tickets to Belgrade and it was done quickly and smoothly. The whole procedure took five minutes on the phone and the customer support answered my emailed questions in a matter of a few hours. Staff have a great level of English and are friendly. The service and food on board flight are excellent as well.

### Air Serbia customer review
FCO-BEG-AUH Economy. Clean aircraft friendly staff good food excellent service. Our first flight FCO-BEG was late because of fog at BEG but we were immediately assisted at the gate and escorted until boarded the connecting flight. Unfortunately one of our luggage was lost and arrived only two days later. Great assistance from their customer service. Recommended.

### Air Serbia customer review
VIE-BEG-VIE (JU 601 on ATR72 and JU 604 on B733) I must say Air Serbia has one of the best economy products in Europe at the moment when it comes to service food and beverages and staff attitude. Cabin crew were very friendly on both flights. On each of these 1 hour flights they served a paper bag with a tasty sandwich cookie and a bottle of water. In addition there even was a wide selection of drinks coffee and tea - all for free in economy in 2015! The ATR72 aircraft was a bit noisy the 733 was much better 30 year old workhorse but refurbished and nice for a change as 733s have become rare in Europe these days. All in all I was very satisfied and will fly Air Serbia again there are good connections and competitive fares from VIE.

### Air Serbia customer review
I had 4 flights with JU the route was BUD-BEG-ATH-BEG-BUD. I must say that I was totally satisfied with the airline. As I was reading the reviews here before my trip I was a little bit worried whether it was worth booking with Air Serbia but in the end I had no doubts that the airline made a huge improvement in order to provide a satisfying service for the passengers. The flights between Budapest and Belgrade were operated with ATR 72 aircraft's which were quite uncomfortable but it was alright for that 1 hr 5 mins of flight time. The surprising thing was that a little paper bag with a sandwich and a bottle of water was provided and they also served coffee and tea onboard. Belgrade Airport was okay however the WiFi was didn't work for me. The flights between Belgrade and Athens were operated with an Airbus A319. The seats were as comfortable as onboard of Lufthansa and it beats Finnair in comfort and onboard service. Another paper bag was provided during the flight with a fine sandwich cookie and a bottle of water. We could also ask from a wide range of beverages coke juices beer and wines. The 1 hr 15 mins flight was smooth in both ways. The crew was extremely helpful and nice thus I can say that the impact of Etihad Airways is clearly visible! If you are willing to travel to the Balkans or to Southern Europe don't hesitate to choose Air Serbia it's totally worth its price. (Which was even the cheapest option in case of my Budapest-Athens trip).

### Air Serbia customer review
ZRH-BEG-OTP-BEG-ZRH: Nice hardware (A319/A320) with very good sets great pitch and on each leg a salami sandwich not very creative and therefore not convincing food although the cookies changed. Cabin personnel friendly but big difference between the announcements in Serbian and English. But for a very competitive price not that bad. Plane for the last leg arrived at time in BEG crew boarded but disembarked 5 minutes before boarding. A plane from Aviolot (their charter company) was brought to the next gate flight was delayed for an hour. Actually no problem rather fly late but with a working plane. Information in English were only given to Biz pax and Serbian speakers which were asked to contact the service desk one after the other. The information letter in English was only handed out at boarding. Simply full of lies: 1) late incoming plane as reason delayed start and landing times wrong cited (so less than 2 hours although it was more writing about refreshments you would have been able to ask for during waiting time but none was brought to the small boarding area). Shame on Air Serbia and shame on Etihad Preferred Guest Partner Airlines if this is the customer relation attitude!

### Air Serbia customer review
What a pleasant surprise that was. Flew from Budapest to Abu-Dhabi via Belgrade then changed to Etihad Airways. Planes were nice and tidy while flight attendants were helpful. Sleeping was flawless occupying the empty seats next to me. Meals could have been better as the sandwich were a bit dry but the cooked meal was alright. There is no entertainment system in their fleet so I would recommend you to bring your own tablet notebook.

### Air Serbia customer review
Flew Bucharest - Stockholm via Belgrade with Air Serbia on a snowy Monday in February. Both flights operated with Airbus 319. Fresh cabins perfect service. A little late on departure from Romania but landed on time. Short transit in Belgrade. Smooth with no problems. Excellent service onboard. Snacks and beverages on the short flight full hot meal with wine served on the flight to Stockholm (free!). Just like flying used to be in the 80s!

### Air Serbia customer review
JU414 and JU 415. Belgrade-Stockholm-Belgrade 22 and 26 January. Could not be faulted in any way. Excellent drinks snacks and food. Good wines (was offered to try both Serbian ones excellent). Flights on time. Five star experience!

### Air Serbia customer review
JU305 on 23 January - BRU-BEG. Check-in chaos as a huge group of pushy people crowded the desks - but the agents kept them in line luckily. Boarding was organized and began 35 minutes before scheduled departure time. Flight was packed but ended up with an empty middle seat next to me! Flight attendants welcomed all passengers with a smile and small talk (I don't speak Serbian and I'd say 95% of the passengers were Serbian) but they were all fluent in English. Departed 5 minutes early and nice 1 hour 50 minute flight. Menus were handed out in coach and a yummy chicken or beef dinner was served. Seats were a little hard but for 2 hours who cares. Landed and luggage was on the belt within 5 minutes after going through immigration. Really enjoyed the flight and service. If they do begin Transatlantic flights and have modern equipment and similar service - they will do well. Looking forward to my return to Brussels.

### Air Serbia customer review
JU827 JU826 JU610. Aug 4 2014 and Aug 11 2014. Will never fly with Air Serbia again. Service bad late planes. Me and my husband traveled from Beirut to Prague we landed in Belgrade and had delays both ways. First trip from Beirut was delayed 2 hours so we had to run to catch our flight to Belgrade. I asked 3 times if our luggage was coming with us I got the same answer - yes . When we landed in Prague it was as I suspected our luggage didn't follow with us. It took us an additional 2 hours to fix everything before we could go to our hotel. The food was very bad service was bad - I asked for a blanket that they didn't give me.

### Air Serbia customer review
AMS-BEG. In October I flew from Belgrade to Amsterdam and back. I really enjoyed my flight. Food was excellent really rare are companies that offer you a menu in economy class on short-haul flight which was the case with Air Serbia. In menu was appetizer main course dessert and wide choice of drinks beginning with all types of juices to various types of wine and whiskey. Also you can choose the main course. The plane was Airbus A319 seats were comfortable and stuff very friendly and kind. I'd fly with Air Serbia again.

### Air Serbia customer review
CDG-ATH-SKG-CDG round trip. What a lovely airline! All flights with very comfortable seat. Cabin crews were very professional and were always present. At CDG our flight was delayed. The purser was very helpful and gave us all information and we didn't miss the connecting flight. air Serbia offers a very good product. Good food good choice of drinks - excellent value for money.

### Air Serbia customer review
I flew from Podgorica Montenegro to Belgrade and than Belgrade to Banja Luka. Even though they were ATR 72 airplanes (rather modest in size) I have to say that I had an extremely pleasant experience. Those ATRs looked very good renewed clean warm and pleasant. Flights were on time and according to the schedule staff were extremely polite and helpful. They looked (at least to me) new and with a lot of energy and enthusiasm. There was a meal served (these are 50 minutes flights i.e. rather short) with beverages and that was very refreshing. Excellent and I would recommend them.

### Air Serbia customer review
An absolute surprise! I flew from Belgrade to London on a Sunday morning and was expecting something pretty awful Instead I would rate it as the best European flight I have taken in the past year! Maybe it has something to do with Air Serbia's link up with Etihad but in any case the staff were pleasant I was offered a choice of hot main meal in economy there was plenty of leg room and the flight left and arrived on time. Couldn't ask for more!

### Air Serbia customer review
Flew BEG-WAW and BEG-AUH. Both flights excellent service crew very professional and polite food excellent interior of the plane fresh and new big improvement! Probably the best service at the moment amongst European carriers.

### Air Serbia customer review
BEG-IST (August 2014) - Boarding at Belgrade airport was on time flight was on time (operated with new Airbus A320) very comfortable for this short relation and I must say nice cabin crew members. Food is basic but still this is a very short flight to expecting more than sandwich cookies and coffee. When we arrived at Istanbul (Ataturk) airport all luggage was there. I can recommend Air Serbia for a flight to Istanbul.

### Air Serbia customer review
BEG-ARN-BEG. Like flying with two different companies. On the first flight to Stockholm it felt like Fawlty Towers on a plane and the purser played the fictional character Manuel. If he could get something wrong he did. The aperitif and nuts came with the main meal “because it is more convenient”. Announcements made on board not understandable because of the poor English spoken in a very fast way. Even though the incompetence of the purser was kind of entertaining from occasionally the whole experience was a disappointment. However things could not have been better than the return flight to Belgrade. Excellent purser and staff who made everything right and could not be more accommodating. Thumbs up! Strangely enough though no champagne offered before takeoff but has to be asked for. Food tasteful but the main dishes slightly dry.

### Air Serbia customer review
First time I flew with Air Serbia from Brussels to Athens via Belgrade. Both flights departed late. But the service in Business Class was amazing. The best business class flight in EU-EU flights for sure. There were only 8 business class seats and on the first flight I was alone so the flight attendant was all mine.

### Air Serbia customer review
PRG-BEG BEG-VIE - operated by older ATR planes little bit noisy but ok BEG-LCA IST-BEG - operated by Airbus airplanes - new comfortable. During 3 flights snack served (sandwich cookie small bottle of water + another drink - very enough for such short flights) to LCA meal served (salad meal dessert). One hour delay to LCA (30mins to solve the problem that 2 passengers had same seat on their boarding card) the other flights on time. On way from IST to VIE we had about 1 hour to change in Belgrade it was enough even for our luggage so don't worry. For money they asked for all tickets they offered more than I expected. I would fly with Air Serbia again.

### Air Serbia customer review
BEG-ATH JU512 A320. Very professional staff food is ok. We landed on time. I was pleased and will fly Air Serbia from now on.

### Air Serbia customer review
Flew to BEG August 23rd and back to STR on Monday 25th. Flight numbers JU341 and JU344. I've recently been flying Air Serbia from STR to BEG and BEG to STR in business class. Although the outbound flight was the old JAT Boeing 737 it has truly been the greatest business class experience I've enjoyed onboard a European airline. Very friendly supportive and attentive cabin crew. On the A319 spacious and comfortable new business class seats (only two rows in the front section so a very private atmosphere). Very tasty F&B (especially the chocolate cake). Last but not least a service of drink refills without any demand from the passengers with a good offering of elegant Serbian wines. I truly recommend this airline!

### Air Serbia customer review
JU415 JU826 JU827 JU410. Will never fly with Air Serbia again. Service bad late planes. Me and my wife traveled to Beirut from Stockholm we landed in Belgrade and had delays both ways - we had time between the planes - 45 min. First trip to Beirut was delayed 3 hours second trip back to Stockholm was late to Belgrade so we had to run to the plane and then we just sat there for 50 mins until the plane took off. I asked 3 times if our luggage was coming with us I got the same answer - we don't know. When we landed it was as I suspected our luggage didn't follow with us. It took us an additional 2 hours to fix everything before we could go home.

### Air Serbia customer review
I booked Air Serbia for a flight from VIE to ATH via BEG and enjoyed a comfortable stay onboard. The aircraft's were clean and the seats seemed to be quite new. The catering-concept with paper bags filled with a sandwich a cookie and a bottle of water was very good as you already had something to drink and did not have to wait for the drinks that were served afterwards. All in all it was a good decision to book Air Serbia I would only wish for an online-check-in-service next time.

### Air Serbia customer review
Frequent flyer AMS-BEG: all the compliments for the staff - Air Serbia provides a great service and a really nice selection of complementary food & beverages. A couple of points for improvement: please add an evening flight on Thursday for AMS-BEG line add on-line check-in please return the 30kg baggage limit finally improve the check- in procedure in BEG for early flights.

### Air Serbia customer review
Agree with punctuality issues: On August 18th we were flying BEG - BRU - New York. There were 52 passengers who had a flight to New York JFK to catch. The airline should know this. Air Serbia decided to wait for a few transit passengers and their baggage risking the flights to New York for the 52 of us thus causing the 52 passengers not making their flight to New York. Other than that: food is the best: nowhere else will you get a cooked meal for a 2 hours flight and it was delicious!

### Air Serbia customer review
Flew LHR-BEG-LHR. Significant improvement from JAT in terms of on board experience especially aesthetic. A319 interior appearance in terms of seat colour lighting and cleanliness on par if not better than the likes of Lufthansa BA Air France. Plane took off on-time on both legs crew were very kind and helpful and seat comfort was solid. The fact that a full meal was served on a 2.5 hour flight was certainly a plus tasted better than what was served on my BA transatlantic flight home. My only reproach would be the slightly irritating boarding music a tad bit too traditional for a 21st century airline setting. All in all it's clear that the company is on the right track and I would not be surprised if it soon ranks among Europe's best in terms of service quality. Glad to see the on-time performance improving day by day especially considering the earlier issues with the Beirut flights.

### Air Serbia customer review
I flew with Air Serbia from Podgorica to Belgrade and from Belgrade to Frankfurt and can recommend it! The staff were very helpful and polite and spoke very good English. The food was good and pillows were provided - a very nice add-on to make any trip more enjoyable. The landing in Frankfurt was fantastic. A very pleasant experience indeed!

### Air Serbia customer review
We recently flew Paris-Belgrade and Belgrade-Paris. It was refreshing to see standards of aircraft interior staff training and general comfort lifted considerably. On both occasions we travelled in business class enjoying perks like comfortable seats delicious meals and excellent service provided by polite flight attendants. I paid for inflight entertainment was provided and together with constant care from flight attendants flight was enjoyable.

### Air Serbia customer review
Will never fly with Air Serbia again. The service was extremely bad. Airport staff WERE the worst and most apathetic I have seen. Food WAS horrible. Miles (for 2 separate flights) were never registered. No information given about anything during the entire trip. seats changed aircraft changed (again - 2 different flights) staff did not know what was going on. No priority boarding. No entertainment system although they promise an ipad. This was like flying economy on a low cost carrier.

### Air Serbia customer review
I flew with Air Serbia in June from Abu Dhabi to Belgrade and from Sarajevo to Belgrade. Nice young friendly cabin crew excellent catering and flying with Serbian people you don't need better entertainment. Both flights were on time with wonderful landing from Sarajevo to Belgrade turning around Avala mountain.

### Air Serbia customer review
BEG-LHR and LHR-BEG flights. I was very pleased. Flight attendants were very kind food was really good flight departed and landed on time baggage came on time. You can see that they have improved food - a lot of great desserts hot drinks refills and a three-course meal. New Aircraft's (Airbus 319 and 320) have nice exterior they aren't noisy at all and magazines were also provided. Really good experience indeed.

### Air Serbia customer review
My family and I were supposed to travel Split - Belgrade - Copenhagen. The flight from Split was delayed so we missed our flight in Belgrade to Copenhagen. The trip ended up lasting 23 hours. Staff in Split airport knew nothing whatsoever about why the flight was delayed. Once we arrived in Belgrade overly rude staff booked us for a flight the next day at 5 pm. We had to be at work the following day and wanted an alternative return flight. After discussing the matter with a manager we were booked for an earlier flight. This took us more than 3 hours! Incredibly poor service and rude staff.

### Air Serbia customer review
I recently travelled from Abu Dhabi to Belgrade. What a fantastic change from JAT to Air Serbia. The staff were very welcoming. There is still a little bit of work to be done with making sure all crew understand that customer requests and their safety is the priority rather than colleague gossip. I was very satisfied with the meal and the variety of drinks provided. The only problem with the trip is the lack of inflight entertainment which is easily fixed with the ipad version like the ones provided by Qantas domestic and Jetstar. I will fly with Air Serbia again in the coming months and look forward to see the airline continue to improve their image and service.

### Air Serbia customer review
WAW-BEG-SKG-BEG-WAW the flights departed on time polite and smiling staff speaking good English relatively new planes baggage arrived without delays. Food was very bland though a sandwich and a tiny bottle of water which is okay for short haul flights. Good price/quality ratio so I can call my experience with Air Serbia positive and I would recommend it.

### Air Serbia customer review
BEI-BEL-CPH and CPH-BEL-BEI: Took a return flight from Beirut to Copenhagen via Belgrade. On both legs the flights were delayed (from BEI-BEl and BEL-BEI). The luggage was delayed for the majority of the flight on both legs in Copenhagen and Beirut. Absolutely dreadful. In Copenhagen the flight was on time but decided to shut the bag drop off an hour early to the amazement of airport staff. The food is inedible and there's no in-flight entertainment. I fly regularly this is the worst experience I've had with an airline.

### Air Serbia customer review
AUH-BEG-LHR. AUH-BEG portion: relatively new plane A319 great food with a local flare (I asked for a lactose-free meal and it was better than expected) comfortable seats FAs super pleasant; great service. BEG-LHR portion: older 737 but totally ok. Great service courteous staff nice meal. Very pleasantly surprised by both flights. Thumbs up!

### Air Serbia customer review
Belgrade - Beirut. Great staff and good food. But and it is a big but these frequent delays on Air Serbia is not acceptable. Punctuality is a must. The nights flight 3 hours late and arrived only after 6 in the morning. Not good at all when planning meetings etc. If punctuality does not get better soon I have to opt for another airline despite the good service onboard.

### Air Serbia customer review
I had a flight from Sarajevo to Paris via Belgrade. The quality of service is considerably improved after rebranding JAT into Air Serbia by Etihad. The food was served for both flights was a small sandwich from Sarajevo and cold meal from Belgrade. The staff were very efficient pleasant and communicative. However I have one general observation -–both flights were delayed about 1 hour. I observed that a number of flights operating by Air Serbia were delayed. This was a bit stressful taking into account one hour stopover. The air company should pay more attention on punctuality and ground staff who suppose to provide assistance to passengers. Otherwise the trip was good and I think the company is on right track.

In 40 years of travelling this was the first time that an airline could not offer hot drinks due to lack of hot water. On a different matter how is it possible to assess an airline without addressing their Baggage and Compensation issues which are such an integral part of the total experience?

Tivat to Moscow via Belgrade was late 3 hours and 32 passengers missed connect flight! We were put in filthy Slavia hotel in Belgrade. I reached Moscow only in the evening on the second day. My claim report wasn't answered!

Flew BUD-BEG-LCA-BEG-VIE as it was far cheaper than any other airline low-costs including. BUD-BEG was on an older ATR72 there was exactly 12 passengers in the plane. Small snack (a sandwich and a cookie in a doggie bag) and one round of drinks on a one hour long flight! Had to ask specifically for the vegetarian meal we ordered (it was on the plane was labelled with my gf's name was not given out automatically). The ride was a little noisy as in the old ATR but can not complain. Problem-free transfer in BEG security at the gate and BEG-LCA on an ancient Boeing 737-300. It had the old JAT livery stripped down but one could still see the outline of the letters and three dots on the tail - from outside the plane looked just sad. Inside however the seats looked refurbished and to my surprise there was quite a lot of legroom. On this 2 hour flight hot meal was served (menu was handed out). I skipped mine my gf had her vegetarian meal and it looked and tasted fantastic. And a bonus - proper metal cutlery! Round of drinks as well. Return LCA-BEG departing at unholy time (4am in the morning) was delayed about half an hour making us worried about short connection in BEG. This time their "new" A319 which is not new at all. The legroom was much worse than on the old 737 and to be honest one of the worst I have ever experienced (I'm 185cm tall). Slept all time so can not comment on the food (but there was some). Bit unorganized transfer in BEG (we were checked all the way to VIE but some other passengers were missing their boarding passes) but I must appreciate that upon leaving the aircraft there was someone for each connecting flight helping the passengers. Last leg BEG-VIE on a sad ATR72 for me a cookie and a yoghurt in a doggie bag the vegetarian meal was an orange (that's it - just orange). Our luggage did not make the short connection in BEG. Air Serbia probably won't be my airline of choice but if they again offer such deal as they did now no problem flying them again.

Used Air Serbia twice once from Stuttgart to Belgrade in February 2014 and once Belgrade to Copenhagen March 2014. Excellent experience. Stuttgart - Belgrade was done by old Bulgarian Boeing but you could still "feel" the difference by newspapers meals and drinks and much younger crew. BEG-Copenhagen was great new Airbus excellent meal and coffee plus great desserts. I will use them again.

I flew London to Belgrade return on a newly fitted Airbus A320 outwards and A319 return. The new Aircraft's have a bright and welcoming interior which sets the scene for their product offering. The crew were polite and attentive throughout the flight although perhaps a little cool in their interactions with passengers. On the outward flight newspapers were offered. A menu on both flights was presented which was a nice touch. The food itself was excellent for a short-haul flight - hot plentiful and served with metal cutlery. Certainly the best on board food in Europe. Boarding at Belgrade however is still not well organised should be improved. Overall though a great experience and fantastic to see a new full service Airline come from the ashes of JAT.

A few days ago I returned from Banja Luka. Although the ATR72 was quite noisy the service was excellent especially for the 45 minute flight. Change in quality in comparison with old JAT is highly visible.

I travelled from DUS-BEG and it was an excellent experience totally refurbished airlplane and had the brand new (A319). Hot meal friendly staff still some bugs to iron out.

### Air Serbia customer review
I have flown with former JAT on a couple of occasions and my impressions were not that great (old planes minimal service and complete disregard for the comfort of passengers). I flew today from Belgrade to Malpensa (flight from Milan to Belgrade I did with Alitalia with a stopover in Rome) although given my previous experience with JAT I wanted to avoid it at all costs. The plane I got onto was neatly furbished quite comfortable economy class seats great catering for a short-haul flight very warm attitude from the crew. The only minus (and it is a big one) currently online check in is not available. Apparently they are working on it and it should be available soon.

I've flown with JAT (what Air Serbia used to be called). It was a very basic experience to put it mildly. I was flying from London Heathrow to Belgrade yesterday. A great experience there are some bugs to iron out but this isn't first class it's biz class. Firstly the seats were new - they reclined back and the foot part lifted up. You got a big pillow for your back or head and a blanket. We had two stewardesses between 6 of us but I think that is because one of them was training the other. Both women were very friendly and attentive and offered refills throughout the 2hrs 45min flight. The food. Well anyone who has flown with JAT will know the food was something you literally did not bother with. It was sub par. Now I had a 3 course meal with a choice of wines and champagne (or local Serbian brandy if I wanted). The meal was delicious - it was well presented and hot and not overcooked. It was served with fresh bread rolls. I am fussy with things and I couldn't fault it. The cabin was clean. The cutlery was metal. I was offered an iPad but I had my own tablet to watch a film on. A very positive experience indeed.

Travelled BEG to AMS and return in January/February 2014. Professional crew comfortable seats with nice pillows on every seat. The food was delicious. Excellent experience.

### Air Serbia customer review
Travelled CDG to BEG and return in late December and early January 2014. The plane was clean (A319) and very well presented with nice pillows on every seat. The crew were very happy to help and were smiling the whole time. You can see that they are new because at times they seemed a bit disorganized but overall they were excellent. The food brings this trip to a whole new level. While in other airlines you are lucky to get a pack of crackers here I got a hot meal. What a transformation from the old airline (JAT).

JU 311 12 Dec and JU 314 to Paris on 15 Dec. Friendly and professional crew very comfortable seats plenty of leg room stylish pillows and blankets excellent selection of wine and drinks and delicious meal. When the flight attendant handed me the menu I thought there must be a fee attached. I got a hot meal free. Excellent experience. On a way back was the same. I came to Belgrade airport ground support staff were smiling professional and accommodating. On the flight back the same good service and experience. Have just bought another ticket with Air Serbia to Thessaloniki!

ARN-BEG 27 January 2014. Old plane still but fantastic service and great food. Staff did their uttermost to serve the passengers. Good wines with plenty of refills. Strange though that there was nothing sweet to drink with the coffee like for example Baileys. When the new Airbus will enter service they might be one of the best airlines in Europe.

BEG-AUH-BNE - 21 Dec 2013. Flight 50% full check-in ok but could not issue ticket or select seat on AUH-BNE component of same ticket which was disappointing. Meal reasonable goulash with gnocchi fine lights on for too long would have preferred brightness lowered soon after take-off for night flight. On arrival to AUH had be bussed to terminal crew decent slight attitude - seemed a bit annoyed that I accidentally called. Otherwise friendly during other times meal service and welcome. Plane looked good and I had whole row to myself so that was great. 7.5 out of 10. Also a bit annoyed to find out unable to earn velocity points even on EY's BNE to AUH since ticket issued by Air Serbia. I'm velocity platinum and AUH-BNE also has VA flight code. Going back in a month and checkmytrip was showing both Etihad and Air Serbia flights AUH to BEG until I advised of this hope it was not blocking others from booking.

BEG-SVO 3 Nov 2013. Check in more organized and efficient than before since line separators were used in the terminal building. Boarding efficient and departure on time YU-ANI B733 clean and well maintained with pillows on every seat. Cabin crew in new uniforms and with good and professional attitude. Catering onboard drastically improved it starts with a printed menu distributed even in economy class. Beverage trolleys are well stocked from juice coke wines to scotch (all free of charge). Real cutlery on food trays accompanied by a nice fresh meat / cheese / egg snack yoghurt and fruit salad. All together amazing transition from the old catering serving. Arrival 10 min ahead of schedule. The only improvement could be an additional inflight announcement from the cockpit who only greeted passengers at time of departure from Belgrade.

Initially I flew with JAT Airways back in September from SKG to BEG with an extremely noisy turboprop aircraft. Either due to long service or due to bad maintenance it felt bad and the service was mediocre having two stewards with basic English and average catering. On January 11 I boarded JU523 again from SKG to BEG. I boarded an Emirates leased A319 with Air Serbia livery and had four very kind stewards. I found small pillows in Air Serbia brand on the seats and overall a huge boost in standards. I asked for a seat change due to a knee problem I had for the seats right at the emergency exit corridor and was immediately granted one. The catering from two small cupcakes in foil had changed into a paperbag with a 0.25l water bottle a paper cup and a packed sandwich with options for only cheese cheese and ham or cheese and turkey plus the trolley with the bar. Given the fact that the flight takes slightly over an hour those are excellent choices. Only minor point is the training of the personnel into the new status of the airline calling once "Welcome onboard JAT Airways flight" and once "Thank you for choosing Air Serbia flight" Overall the impression I got was as if I was in a star alliance equivalent member airline.

JU 651 SVO-BEG (27th Dec). B733 YU-ANK seat 2A. Load factor 100% (both J and Y classes). Departed gate 16 min late due to late start of boarding. Cabin crew purser in early 50's but all other members significantly younger. Crew did not provide assistance with overcoats but welcome drinks served. Newspapers menu and food orders taken by purser while taxiing. Served after take off drink with warm nuts. Choice of main food between chicken with vegetables and staffed zucchini. Appetizer consisted of 2-3 shrimps and salmon. Chocolate cake for desert very tasty. Choice between 2 red and 2 white wines and good selection of aperitifs and non alcoholic drinks. Overall good meals and selection but nothing spectacular. Service was good and there is nothing to complain about but it lacked a bit of final touch to categorize it as something one remembers no refills offered (same with bread basket) but after asking I got everything. Cockpit crew made 2 announcements to welcome passengers and also gave in flight details. Arrived BEG about 15 minutes after schedule at gate A10 (operational air bridge). Luggage came in shortly but priority tag status was not observed during delivery. Overall fair rating would be 8 (out of ten). To be improved: earlier check in time of departure punctuality assistance with coats a bit more leg room appetizer could be better and a salad would be a + additional runs with bread / wine (without asking) would be nice. Absolutely not worst than AF or LH European service in business but not quite like Asian or Middle East airlines.

Flew JU656 BEG-SVO on 8/1/14. Departure on time. 100% full even though SU had a flight leaving some 20-30 minutes prior to ours. Catering in business was fantastic worth trying "home-made meatballs and stuffed peppers" and Serbian made Chardonnay! Purser and cabin staff very communicative and pleasant. Overall great flight and product even for a red-eye.

Travelled to Belgrade on 9th November YU 381 and returned to London on 16th November YU380. What a pleasant surprise. Food was very good and for a change it was served with proper cutlery!

London Heathrow to SKG via Belgrade return and feel disappointed. At the beginning of November my flight which I had booked in May to get a good price was rescheduled and now included a sleepover in Belgrade both ways with no accommodation offered. All 4 flights were late from 30 to 40 minutes without an explanation nor an apology offered. Cabin was very nice new and modern and staff looked professional but were mostly inattentive and got annoyed when asked to move out of the way so people could get to the toilet. Even when I asked for specific help I was ignored by several FAs. English was a problem on the flight back to Heathrow. Drinks get served by 1 member of staff to the entire cabin which takes about an hour. By the time I got my drink I had spent about 2 hours without a drink there is no option to buy any at Belgrade past security check and flight was so late. By the time we got our drinks the meal that had been served an hour before had gone cold the cheese on top of the salad had started to melt and the white wine (served in a small plastic cup) had gone warm. Some people were told "sorry no beef left chicken only". That was the only flight that offered a decent meal. I thought overall that a lot of effort has been made with the re-branding and it looks great but customer service is not great and there are organisational issues on board. Most disappointing was the cancellation of the daily connection between Heathrow and SKG and how we were dealt with. I will be avoiding this airline in future.

TIV-BEG return economy class. Both flights operated by ATR 72 aircraft. On both legs aircraft showing age cabin dirty and seats old and cramped. One complimentary drink offered on each flight. Cabin crew very polite in spite of their age and dressed in a little bit worn out uniforms. Still the best option on this route.

### Air Serbia customer review
FRA-BEG return last week. Flight experience good quite old but clean Boeing 737-300 cabin crew was friendly. Inflight service very simple (consisted of a small cheese ham and pickles sandwich and beverages) but adequate for a 2 hours flight. Would fly with them again.

LHR-Belgrade-LHR in business. Alitalia lounge at Heathrow was quiet and pleasant with adequate facilities. Onboard the 737 business was in a dedicated cabin with three rows of seats in a 2x2 config. These are old-style first class seats with plenty of leg room. Pre-flight juice and water offered sparkling wine on request. FA’s busy and courteous. Food ordinary airline food served in massive portions – a Serbian characteristic. Crew generous with wine and other drinks. Cabin was full but with all that space you hardly noticed. All in all it made me nostalgic for the days when most business classes in Europe were like this – ie a sufficiently different experience to warrant the higher price. JAT’s price is roughly £500 as opposed to BA £800 on the same route. Only slight disappointment was the funereal business lounge at Belgrade (tatty purple leather sofas) but even that offered a waitress service of drinks and snacks. Would definitely fly JAT business again.

Business class Dubai-Belgrade via Beirut. Very nice flight on 737-300 aircraft in good condition with 12 Business class seats. Cabin crew professional meals with full size trays out of Dubai and Beirut. Luggage claim in Belgrade was quick.

### Air Serbia customer review
I regularly travel on JAT Business Class between Zurich and Belgrade and am extremely satisfied with the product which is much better than one would typically expect. Seating is probably the best Business Class seating on short haul flight with 2 x 2 seating big First Class leather seats and only 10-12 seats depending on aircraft type. Service is 4* with hot meals being served even on afternoon flights of one and a half hour duration. early they are usually less expensive to London than BA.
