### "Kulula are Always late"
Not Verified |  Kulula are Always late, booked a flight for my son from Cape Town to JHB. Flight left 2.5 hours late getting him to OR Tambo at 11.30pm with him trying to find an Uber, never using them again. Now I remember why I switched to Safair who are far better and cheaper.

### "no communication at all"
Not Verified |  I booked an early flight to Durban 3 March to have a full day of work in Durban. I arrive at the OR Tambo airport only to find out that my flight has been cancelled and no communication at all. They put me on another flight 3 hours later, this is ridiculous. Not sure how any business can operate like this in this difficult economical time.

### "they’ve really upped their game"
The cabin crew were amazing. They really took control of the cabin and looked after all the passengers. The thing I’ve never seen is how they controlled the disembarking of the plane, ensuring specific rows would get up in an orderly fashion. I’ve flown Kulula for over a decade and they’ve really upped their game!

### "This is my last encounter with Kulula"
Horrible treatment of customers. I felt like a child because of the absolute rudeness of staff. My flight was canceled with no explanation and I was put on an earlier flight, I checked in the night before to ensure I am seated next to my husband and once we got to the boarding gate I was told I was moved, no one could explain why and told me to go to my new seat and there is nothing they can do. Once in the aircraft I asked the first attendant if I can be moved back and he rudely said there is nothing he can do. A second attendant understood and asked the gentleman seated in my original seat if we could swap (turns out he checked in late and was given my seat) once sorted the head attendant rudely demanded to see our boarding passes and treated us in the worst way before she realized she was wrong and we were in our correct seats. For the remainder of the flight she would not even serve as, even though our seats were allocated to her. This is my last encounter with Kulula.

### "It is impossible to get hold of anyone"
This review does not relate primarily to the quality of flight but customer service. It is impossible to get hold of anyone, and when you do, they do not assist. 1) I booked a flight with the airline in December, which I subsequently had to cancel given that I tested positive for COVID-19. I provided proof to the airline and a refund was requested. Subsequently, the refund was deposited as a voucher in Travelbank. However, to details that are not my own? I cannot understand why I had to verify all my details for the money to get sent elsewhere? I therefore, have no way of accessing this money. 2) Next, I am trying to book a flight to the UK, I need to do so urgently to apply for the appropriate visas. Although the flight is British Airways (BA), I have to book through Kulula to access my Discovery Vitality Contribution. However, whenever you click on any BA flight, it just says error. I have been trying multiple times a day, everyday, for over a week, myself and my spouse have sat on hold for over four hours with no luck. After being on hold for an hour on one of the occasions, my spouse got through to someone who said that they will escalate the matter related to BA flights not working. We have not heard back. I have also sent multiple emails with no response. Unfortunately, British Airways will likely lose that money because we cannot wait indefinitely to book flights. I am honestly questioning whether booking through Kulula is worth the Vitality Contribution.

### "Won't be using them again"
Zero social distancing, sitting like sardines. Badly damaged my bag that was booked in, had to buy a new one before returning on a different airline. Won't be using them again.

### "worst airline in this country"
Absolute worst airline in this country. They have absolutely no regard for their passengers or the fact that we’re in a pandemic. If you want an airline who’ll actually get you to your destination safely and without any problems, literally choose anyone but Kulula.

### "They will never see us again"
Pathetic airline. We arrived well on time for our flight, was sent around, in the end they gave our seats to other people. Zero customer service, basically stole R7000. Male at Kulula service kiosk has no idea about dealing with customers. Arrogant and rude. Nothing is their fault, they blame the customer. Two other people on the same flight were also told their seats were given to someone else. They will never see us again.

### " incompetent and unhelpful staff"
Not Verified |  Horrible customer service. After being on hold for hours on end not a single agent was able to assist in changing my flight time. Completely incompetent and unhelpful staff who cannot process a single email. Will never recommend this airlines and never use it again.

### "you sit on the phone for hours"
Not Verified |  My wife and i flew from George to Johannesburg. We paid for a return flight to George for tomorrow 29 Oct. I tried to move our flight with one week. The service at Kulula is so pathetic that you sit on the phone for hours. Apparently they experience hi call volumes. That was the case for days now. We decided to lose the ticket and money and book one with FlySafair. So unfortunate that we are with Discovery medical and this is the only service they use.

### "never reliable"
Not Verified | Cape Town to Johannesburg . The worst airline ever. Always changing their flight times. When you contact them they don't pick up - one hour you will be on hold. I will never fly Kulula again - never reliable.

### "impossible to use the money in the travel bank"
Not Verified |  We booked tickets through Kulula March 2020 and then level 5 lockdown came and all travel was prohibited. My Mother have a total value of R6400 and I have a total value of R7500 booked for flights from JHB to Cape Town. After Lockdown Level 5, Kulula was in business rescue. Kulula started flying again in November 2020. When we wanted to use the tickets in December 2020, they said we are only allowed to use the tickets from January 2021. They only accept “new” purchases. After that as you know the 3rd and 4th Covid wave came and we were unsure on when to travel. And now they only give you 2 months to use the travel bank as they call it. Me and my mother called Kulula on the 14th September and after I spoke to them for 50 minutes with no progress, my mother had a 2 hour and 30 minute discussion only to find out that we will have to apply for a travel bank again. Firstly, they said they waived the cost of R800 per ticket due to Covid, but that I would have to pay extra for the flights now as they have had quite a price increase. I have to pay an additional R800 per ticket at the current prices, but referring to the ticket prices it was not that expensive. We had a look on their website and there wasn’t that much of a price increase at all. They could not give me the details regarding the prices, but just said it is more expensive now which in my opinion is NOT the case. Covid happened, but now we have to be the ones on the losing end and Kulula is unreasonable, sly and wants more money. They make it impossible to use the money in the travel bank. No one has that extra to pay and they will not give a refund.

### "their service is non existent"
Not Verified |  If you book with them and they cancel your flight, you will not be able to contact them to get your money back or get your flight changed.. I have been struggling for 2 months to get my flight changed ... they don't answer their phone and they don't respond to emails. I cannot give anything more than 1 star for everything because their service is non existent.

### "never recommend Kulula to anyone"
Not Verified |  This is the first time I have ever felt compelled to write a review of any kind. My daughter (12) was forced to leave her cello behind at a storage facility at OR Tambo. Kulula policy states they should be informed 48h prior about cellos. According to policy, I tried to contact Kulula customer care several times, holding for more than 10 min respectively, with no avail. I sent an email, but have up to this day, not received any confirmation. My daughter was left in tears, begging the rude check-in lady to please help. She was even sarcastically told that she could wait at the airport for 48h for the next flight to take the cello. No empathy was shown. She was treated with disrespect and contempt. Their incompetence caused so much stress, wasted time and money I do not have! It cost me R1600 (which was meant for Apr school fees) for a courier to safely get it back to the Western Cape. My daughter (inseparable from her cello) was severely traumatized by this. Fearing that her cello will get damaged/stolen. Her cello is the one object she loves dearly, just as someone else feels about their car, phone or laptop. I will never ever make use of this airline again and will never recommend Kulula to anyone.

### "So disappointed in Kulula!"
Myself, My 19 Week Pregnant daughter, My sister and My Daughters Mother in law had our flights booked & paid on 16 May 2019. We were on a MSC Cruise to the Portugese Islands (28 Feb - 2 March 2020). We were at the King Shaka airport at about 7H15 the morning, but our flight was only 13H00, so we had breakfast and something to drink later the day, when we wanted to check in (Check in starts 90 min prior) just before 12H00, we were told that the flight is fully booked and they can't help us. Maybe they will be able to help us at 15H30. I was shocked, because I never knew they can bump you of your flight, as we had paid our tickets 10 months ago, and wasn't aware that we can check in before you give in your luggage. (I was under the impression that you can only check in before the time if you have hand luggage). I was furious, as they explained to us that they overbook the flights, because some people do not pitch for the flights, and then they could have put someone else in that seat. After a huge fight and a lady from Kulula treating us badly they offered us a discount on our next flight and a meal voucher of R110 pp. One of the Kulula employees even told us that the MSC was at the harbour earlier than expected, and there were people who wanted an earlier flight, so they gave away our tickets, this is just ridiculous! After waiting for about 30 Minutes they booked us on a flight, and we did not even sit together. Meanwhile the rude Kulula attendant asked us if she can book us with Mango but then we need to pay for new tickets? So disappointed in Kulula!

### "This is ridiculous"
Lanseria to Cape Town with Kulula. Worst airline ever, stuck at the airport because flight left from Durban to Lanseria airport with a damaged fire extinguisher. We have a 3 hour delay because we have to wait for another flight to bring a spare fire extinguisher! This is ridiculous! Couldn't even offer meal vouchers or even juice box for kids.

### "decided to get some refreshments"
We had a flight from OR Tambo to King Shaka on the 3rd Jan 2020 at 20:55. When it was time for boarding at 20:20, we made our way to the gate where no one had started boarding at 20:50. We went to the counter and asked about the delay and they said it would be delayed by 5-10 minutes. We then decided to get some refreshments, the notice boards were then updated with information that our flight was delayed to 00:20+. We went back to the gate to board for the flight at 23:30 but no one was there besides passengers. We asked staff members who were still around what is going on and we were advised that the gate had changed and that we should have been put on another flight to Durban. Later on we were advised that there was no other flight to Durban for the night. We waited from 00:00 until 2:30am for the Kulula staff to issue hotel vouchers to us, only then were we told and we be put on the first flight in the morning (4th Jan 2020 @ 7am) and that our bags had left on the other flight which we were supposed to get on and they are now in Durban without us. During these 2 hours of waiting there was no communication from any staff of what the way forward was. No apology was made either. Further to this, Kulula was sending out SMS’s with the following information, none of which were true: 20:28- flight is now boarding 20:58- flight is delayed and will now depart at 23:00 20:59- flight is delayed and will now depart at 23:45 There were no formal announcements made about gate changes or aircraft changes. The notification boards were not updated with the correct information either. These are the following issues that I have with this incident:  Communication from the airline is nonexistent. There were no announcements made for changes to the flight, the boards were not updated with the correct information. If the flight was changed, when the passengers were boarding, staff should have checked that all the passengers were on board and if not, final boarding calls should have been made at least. Our luggage was sent to Durban without checking the corresponding passengers are on board the flight.

### "had the worst experience"
Johannesburg to Durban. I had the worst experience with Kulula. The flight was delayed for over 45 minutes with no communication. And my the clothes inside my bag were wet.

### "instructed to get off the plane"
Johannesburg to Durban. I am disgusted at the way this airline is run. The flight was scheduled at 18:10. The flight was then delayed to 20:20 and then again to 20:40. It is now 21:40 am I am sitting on the plane and have just been instructed that every passenger needs to get off the plane and go and identify their bags individually. This is the biggest joke of an airline I have ever experienced.

### "delayed, no apology offered"
East London to Johannesburg. After being warned of recurrent Kulula delays, i decided to take a chance then boom. Flight is delayed, no apology offered by airline, no food offered since its only a 2 hour delay. Who pays for this one. I do not recommend such an airline that cannot manage time.

### "without any notifications from Kulula"
Lanseria to Durban. We celebrated our 41st anniversary and our Son paid for the Airline Tickets to Durban and back. We were delayed by this grounding of the planes on 22 October 2019. First message 05:35 - flight MN502 due to depart 13:00 - delayed to 16:35. Second message 09:21 - Flight delayed to 17:35. We have to be out of our Hotel by 11:00 and the Hire Car must be back at 13:00 - so we just had to go to the Airport and sit and wait. Next message - 10:23 - flight delayed to 18:35 - next message 19:35 and at 15:36 the next message to depart at 22:05. Seven hours on the Airport without any notifications from Kulula. I went to the Counter and the Lady had this Sheepish expression on her face until I told her that you do not seem to be interested in what I am telling you. She informed me that all the flights are full and no available seats on other flights. Luckily the Lady next to her told her to check another flight and book us there and then this one got a bit of life. We were booked on the 19:00 flight. Long story short we eventually left with 8 seats open - arrived an hour later in Johannesburg. On the Airport I asked what about meal vouchers and only when I asked, she gave me 2 vouchers of R110.00 each.

### "never use this airline again"
Durban to Johannesburg. Worst experience of my life with Kulula, there have no customer service whatsoever. R4500 down the line return flight from Durban to Johannesburg and they can't be bothered that you delayed or not or make arrangements to accommodate you in someway or the other. Will never use this airline again.

### "check-in grumpy and idiotic"
Cape Town to Johannesburg. Ok flight, take-off delayed by 45 minutes due to late arrival of aircraft, check-in grumpy and idiotic (demanding to weigh a small framed painting that did not even weigh 500gr, despite ample luggage allowance not used up), supervisor felt staff did the right thing, amazing.

### "we are once again delayed"
Johannesburg to East London. Typical of this inefficient airline, we are once again delayed. How can this airline charge their customers full price when they continue to delay flight times and which in turn not only creates problems for the customer, but costly too.

### "wait for 2 hours for next flight"
Johannesburg to Cape Town. We (parents, children and grand parents) had bought tickets for a connecting flight to Cape Town from J-burg more than half a year ago and only had a short time to find the Kulula check in counter, which wasn't so easy for us. We got there 20 mins before the counter was closing, but were told the flight had been overbooked. Everybody at the counter was hopelessly confused, and not very good at communicating to us. After a lot of waiting around, we had to wait for 2 hours for the next flight. Returning from Cape Town with Mango Air was way better.

### "staff is friendly"
Johannesburg to Cape Town. In-flight service is good, food is okay, beverages are okay, staff is friendly and ready to help but luggage handling is staffed with petty criminals. Had my luggage ransacked and robbed.

### "Nice airline, on time"
Johannesburg to Cape Town. Nice airline, and on time. My only gripe is the horrible cloth seats on the Europcar Aircraft, reminds me of British Rail seats of old. Time for a refurb me thinks

### "They are always delayed"
Cape Town to Johannesburg. This is the third time I have used Kulula because of my vitality discount. I will never book another flight with them again. They are always delayed and take forever to get the luggage out.

### "flights both delayed"
Kulula flights are always delayed. My flight from Johannesburg to Cape Town, as well as this flight back to Johannesburg, are both delayed due to technical issues. I am beginning to wonder if Kulula are just so ill-prepared that all the last-minute checks find issues.

### "in queue for hours"
Johannesburg to Durban. No communication, standing in queue for hours. How can we be on time for our commitment. Unfriendly staff. Rather drive next time

### "service is just not acceptable"
Cape Town to Johannesburg. Although Kulula was aware (since the morning) of a 2 hour delay on their last flight out (making the flight at 10:30 PM!) on a Sunday evening, they did not feel it was necessary to let the passengers know of this delay! I am traveling with a 4 month old baby and being stuck at the airport for an extra 2 hours is just not something that is ideal when traveling with a baby, never mind getting home even later than scheduled! I understand that there could always be delayed but when the airline is made aware of the delay well in advance surely the right thing to do is let the passengers know so that arrangements can be made so one is not as inconvenienced! We phoned the car company to let them know of our delay but they were already informed, so why would they be informed but not the actual passengers! This service is just not acceptable, no one wants to spend an extra 2 hours at an airport especially with a 4 month old baby!

### "Service levels have dropped"
Durban to Lanseria. Every time I fly Kulula on a Friday evening the last flight is delayed! From 19.45 to 20.30 now. Which means I arrive home at midnight! If it was a one off I would understand, but it’s always a Friday delay on the last flight - absolutely unreliable. Kulula used to be the airline that was always on time. Service levels have dropped. I will definitely reconsider using Kulula in future.

### "made the flight comfortable"
Johannesburg to Durban. Loved the flight. The take off, journey and landing was splendid and in particular was the cabin crew who were professional and charming the whole flight even though it was only 45 mins. They made the flight comfortable and enjoyable

### "my seat had been changed."
Cape Town to Johannesburg, Our flight was operated by Comair, therefore this needs to be taken into consideration regarding the following review. After 2 hours of delayed take-off standing at the gate, the clerk tells me my seat had been changed. Usually one couldn't do much I guess, but this time I specifically paid for a seat in the front section in order to leave early upon landing. Everyone was stressed an I didn't want to fuss too much around, so they gave me a number to call later to get my refund. Great they give me the job to arrange my refund. The next day I call, they tell me a story, I have to write an email etc.. It's a typical situation where the customer gets pushed around, wasting time to get his rightful refund for a service not provided. I thought instead of writing them an email, with all the details, I thought it would be better to go public about this and warn against their paid seat service.

### "delayed by 3 hours"
Cape Town to Johannesburg. Flight delayed by 3 hours. Checked in online with aisle seat only to be given a middle seat at the check in counter. Rude check in agent. It took me 3 attempts to get an aisle seat again. Cramped seats, unfriendly service. Use South African Airways for a better service!

### "the worst low cost airline"
Johannesburg to Cape Town. By some distance the worst low cost airline in South Africa. You have almost no chance of being on time for any flight after midday. Terrible legroom. Avoid!

### "wouldn't recommend it to anyone"
A month I flew Kulula to Durban from Johannesburg there were delays. Today I am flying Kulula from East London to Johannesburg, we have delays. Kulula is really dropping the ball. I honestly wouldn't recommend it to anyone even if cheaper. Rather book an airline that is dependable .

### "Long wait. Under staffed"
Flew Kulula from Johannesburg to Durban. Long wait. Under staffed. Rude. Asked for seat with leg room and he put me in back seat with no leg room. Awful. This isnt the first time. Particularly poor is the attitide of the check in staff. Also not well presented or dressed but mainly lack of service.

### "changed the check-in times"
Durban to Lanseria. My wife was at check-in 40 mins before flight and only found out then that Kulula changed the check-in times from 30 mins to 45 mins before departure. No Kulula employee was willing to help even thought she had a small bag which could be taken in as hand luggage. This happened on the 13th Nov 2017 and I emailed Kulula on that day and to date I have not received any response. Pathetic customer service from Kulula.

### "low cost that gives a fair service"
Durban to Johannesburg with Kulula. Nice to be honest, simple planes, old, but crew were nice and not aggressive. Flight on time, a low cost airline that gives a fair service. Fast check in. 45 minute normal flight. Plenty of space for the bags.

### "customer service is deplorable"
Had a very bad experience with Kulula flying from Johannesburg to Cape Town. I had picked exit row seats when purchasing the tickets months in advance. When we go to leave the bags at the counter they said the flight had changed. They reassigned seats and I asked them to make sure to give us exit row seats. They agreed and said we had exit row seats. One of our group had a check in bag 2 kg over the limit. The other check in bags were 6 kg, 2 kg, and 1 kg under the limit. But they said for the 2 kg overage which would cost us R300 or we have to move things around. So after 5 minutes of shuffling things around they say we are good to go. Once we get onboard we realize not only are these not exit row seats but we can not recline the seat back. Customer service is deplorable.

### "service little unprofessional"
I experienced over 2 hour delays on both Kulula flights to and from George from Johannesburg, which caused extreme dissatisfaction as plans had to be rearranged and some fell through. I also checked in online but my seats that I had specifically chosen were disregarded as another aircarft had to be used. The service was in my opinion a little unprofessional and I found it really disappointing as I felt that I did not get my money's worth regarding both flights. Not very keen to use this airline again as delayed flights seem to be a pattern.

### "disappointed with their service"
Cape Town to Johannesburg with kulula. Bad service and unreliable timing. Paid more for front seat and did online booking. Flight was more than 2 hours late and could not use bag drop off, had to book in again and get in queue to book in. Was then informed about different seat, nor what we have paid for. Tried to change to earlier flight that was not full, but ground staff totally unfriendly to help. Very disappointed with their service.

### "crew smart, outstandingly friendly"
For a lowcost airline, Kulula has a very good product. Liked that baggage is included. The airplane was clean and  the crew was smart, outstandingly friendly and very funny. They made so many jokes I primarily thought i wasn't flying but in a comedy show. Very impressive and still professional. Certainly recommended.

### "not recommend due to seating"
I flew Kulula from Johannesburg to East London return. I don't think I have ever been so uncomfortable on an aircraft and I have flown on numerous low cost airlines before. The seating is dreadful. The crew on the outbound flight were not too friendly, but a lot better on the return. I would not recommend Kulula due to the seating. They could remove one row to try to be a little more competitive.

### Kulula customer review
My recent return trip from JNB to DUR, MN603 and MN612, respectively, was punctual and uneventful. While the seats were a little cramped, I couldn't complain since it was a budget airline. Service was good and I especially enjoyed the jokes made by the flight attendants during their announcements.

### Kulula customer review
Flight JNB to CPT and return a few days later. Full planes on time clean and friendly staff. What more do you need?

### Kulula customer review
I was booked on flight MN595 from Lanseria to King Shaka Airport Durban on Wed 30th March to urgently get to Durban. We were due to leave at 2.40 which would have given me sufficient time. I had to take annual leave in order to be at the airport on time and then when it was time for our flight there was not a plane in sight. Some passengers had been sitting there since 10 am that morning. I finally after a 7 or 8 hour delay arrived at King Shaka Airport at approximately 10.30 that night and then had to try and find a shuttle. Never again!

### Kulula customer review
I was booked for a flight at 18.10 on 1/4/2014 giving me sufficient time to be in time for my nieces wedding at 8.00. My flight was delayed 3 times and finally only left ORT at 8.40 needless to say I missed the wedding. Kulula did nothing to compensate us for the inconvenience we suffered. I will never fly with them again.

### Kulula customer review
Through entirely my own fault I arrived at the check-in desk 20 minutes before take off which was clearly too late to drop off my luggage and board. I was expecting to buy entirely new tickets but instead they only charged me R35 to go on the next plane 50 minutes later! Service was excellent on the plane too and we actually arrived 10 minutes early at my destination. Won't hesitate to fly them again!

### Kulula customer review
We travelled with Kulula as our local flight to ORT for our onward international flight. Flight was on time and the plane was full and a bit stuffy. At the time that we booked the prices were quite expensive. Flight was ok.

### Kulula customer review
Just flew Cape Town to Durban and was impressed. When I arrived the computer system was down and was told to return an hour later as they were dealing with the earlier Johannesburg check in manually. When I returned the computers were back and we had usual check in. All staff friendly plane only 20 mins late 20kg or free checked luggage plane clean and new luggage out right after arrival only gripe was limited seat space I'm 183cm so its a usual problem. For the price I am happy and would fly them again.

### Kulula customer review
Cape Town to Johannesburg Lanseria on 03 Jan 2013. Flight was supposed to leave at 15.50. Received an SMS that the flight had been delayed to 18.00 then further delayed to 20.00. When I arrived at the airport to check in told that the flight was delayed until 00.45. No information coming out of the Kulula desk other than mixed reports. The only compensation we received was a meal voucher. Flight further delayed until 01.30 in the morning. The Kulula desk took our details and assured us there would be a taxi at the other end. When we arrived at Lanseria airport - no taxis in sight. When the 'shuttle' arrived it was a lone taxi driver. At no point did we receive any apology or plausible explanation. On top of that the 'quirky' in-flight announcements were not funny (not at 01.30 in the morning). I will never recommend this airline again.

### Kulula customer review
I had the misfortune of flying on this airline on 31st Aug from Durban to Joburg where I was catching an International flight. As usual Kulula were running late half an hour in this case with no explanations and no apologies. I had half an hour when we landed to get my case and run to the international side to book in! Now I have to fly back with them on my return ticket on Monday. I have flown with them before and 9 out of 10 times they are late. Never again will I fly with them!

### Kulula customer review
I took two elderly ladies one of 80 to Cape Town Airport flying to Lanseria. They had two suitcases and two bags. Firstly told they were only allowed one piece of luggage each and were expected to pay R350 for the other 2 bags. I asked if there was assistance or a shuttle to the plane and was told no. They were not assisted with lifting heavy suitcases and had to walk with these heavy bags. Half way to the departure lounge the one lady was unable to walk any further and had to order a wheelchair which she waited ages for. Their seats were changed they were assisted both of them now in wheelchairs. I was disappointed in the lack of care and compassion shown by staff.

### Kulula customer review
Flew Jo'burg to George with Riviera Travel Tour Group. A typical no frills Airline but Staff were attentive and provided an amusing commentary during the flight which everyone seemed to enjoy.

### Kulula customer review
Cape Town to PE my first time flying with my 11 month old baby. I requested a porter to help push the trolley. At check-in I was not asked if I needed a porter I did not know that I had to ask. When I boarded the plane they gave me a window seat next to 2 other passengers. Fortunately the flight attendant offered me a seat for myself and my baby alone.

### Kulula customer review
JNB-DUR. Easy check in friendly staff. Flight left on time and landed early in Durban. Very good value for money .Domestic travel within South Africa has become efficient and very competitive.

### Kulula customer review
Johannesburg to Port Elizabeth return. Plane was on time staff was fantastic and my granddaughter had a fantastic time as well. Returning to JNB check in at Port Elizabeth airport was a bit hectic but the flying experience was spotless! Made a short Port Elizabeth vacation exceptional.

### Kulula customer review
DUR-JNB on Kulula during World Cup. Kulula give you assigned seat numbers. Ground staff and FAs very friendly with their notorious humorous announcements. 737-700 quite new and clean. Flight on time food and drinks for extra charge not too expensive though. During our online booking we had already added extra kilos to our baggage allowance so no hassle with the weight of our luggage at the airport.

### Kulula customer review
DUR-JNB Flight initially posted with a 20 minute delay. This kept being updated as the departure was further delayed. Uneasy with the increasing delay - 50 minutes total but I'll give them credit for constantly keeping pax informed. Being that this was during the World Cup I can accept a 50 minute delay. Fare was most reasonable and no problem with checked bag. Would fly them again.

### Kulula customer review
GRJ-JNB. 18 hours before departure I received a text advising that the flight scheduled for the next morning at 10.40 was delayed until 14.30. As this was going to inconvenience me I tried calling them to see if I could reschedule. This is where I saw how abysmal Kulula after sales service is. After listening to 25 minutes of inane drivel (at R2.40 a minute) telling me how wonderful their service is and how all their agents were just waiting to pick up the phone and help me I gave up. Later I contacted the office at George Airport where the response was unhelpful and I was offered a refund. The alternative SAA flight would have at that point cost me R800 more. I wish I had booked SAA from the beginning but foolishly thought it was worth saving some money. That said I understand that flights can be delayed I was notified in advance and when I checked in I was given a R250 voucher to use on a future Kulula booking and the service and flight were satisfactory. I don't like the Kulula 'jokey' approach and the 'funny' announcements - most of the FA's simply can't pull it off and it's just irritating.

### Kulula customer review
Booked on a flight from CPT to JNB. At check in I was told my flight had been delayed by 2 hours. Without asking they changed me to a British Airways flight at no extra cost. Even though I did not get to fly with them I'm more than happy to book with them in the future given their excellent customer service.

Flew from Lanseria 10 minutes from home simple check-in in under 30 seconds flights on time entertaining crew overall a pleasant experience. I could not fault Kulula or the airport.

### Kulula customer review
I was delayed 26 hours on a Lanseria (HLA) to Durban flight on 11 June. Departure was initially 17:30. We were first told that we were delayed for 3 hours. Then we were told we were leaving at 23:30. At 23:00 they told us the flight was cancelled. Put up in some lodge and told they would fly us out the next day at 14:40 on a specially chartered plane. This never materialised. I was lied to the following day regarding departure times and the mystery charter plane. Eventually told we were on a 16:20 flight. At 16:00 they told us it was delayed to 18:20! Finally my nightmare ended at 20:00 on 12 June when we finally touched down in Durban. Throughout the ordeal the staff were unsympathetic and we were made to feel that the problem was ours.

I flew Cape Town to Lanseria yesterday to be told "we are sorry your flight has been delayed" If this would happen once it would be acceptable but it seems to be almost every time. We plan our meetings pick ups to the times given to us by Kulula  why not change the times to allow for all the problems you seem to have. When we got on the flight we were told that they have a problem with the catering company and to sort this out the plane would leave even later so we rather go without. Next the flight attendant informs us that we cannot use our credit or debit cards as they have a problem. Further more the Kulula comic was not available.

JNB to Durban. On time and crew were great - loved the comedy in the announcements. Aircraft clean and not too tired. Recommend them to anyone looking for well priced flights in South Africa.

### Kulula customer review
We flew to OT on Kulula last week from Cape Town. The initial flight I booked was cancelled by cell phone and we were placed on the next flight with no apology and great inconvenience to ourselves. On our return flight we were bumped at the last moment having arrived 2 hours early-then told they could actually fit us in? The flight by then was running at least 3/4 an hour late. The couple ahead of us had been bumped twice that day.

LHR-HEJNB-CPT and the flight was delayed - no explanation given. Return to JNB again flight delayed - operational problems as an excuse given. The only "operational problems" I saw in CPT was at 05.30 waiting to book in for the 07.00 flight - only two operators on duty when another two finally came on duty a meeting was called by someone I assume to be the supervisor. Surely this can be done before they go on duty? No apologies given just "next" if you were lucky others got a nod of the head! A case of couldn't care less for customers.

### Kulula customer review
Probably the most awful flying experience I have ever had. Complete chaos at check in and ended up being bumped off flight we were promised compensation but no one could tell us who was to provide this compensation. The 6 hour delay at JNB International with 3 children under 4 was an experience I could have done without. The hostesses were I am sure quite funny but at that stage I was in no mood to laugh and found their flippancy annoying and somehow insulting considering the 8 tortuous hours we had just spent because of that airline. Still waiting for their "feedback department" to get back to me 2 months later. My advice is to arrive really early because when it goes wrong its not all fun and games.

We flew from Lanseria to Durban yesterday 26 December. Flight was 2 hours late we were told once we boarded because one of the escape chutes had expired and a new one had to be fitted! Lanseria is the best way to fly to Durban the extra cost is well worth not having to go via OR Tambo. We were given vouchers to make up for the inconvenience of the delay - a nice touch. Lanseria ran out of food so Kulula organised sandwiches at the airport. One complaint the snacks are very expensive - R9.00 for a 200ml can of Coke! Surely after a delay that long the drinks should be free on the flight?

Cape Town to Johannesburg. Very cheap ticket was actually waiting for a bad experience as I don't particularly trust the low cost carriers. What a surprise to experience the opposite! BA check in staff polite and cheerful. Flight on a MD-80 departed on time. Cabin interior funny with that light green and blue colors! Cabin crew fantastic!!! Great sense of humor and extremely helpful. While selling food they were out of the vegetarian sandwich so they offered me free snacks and one cabin crew staff gave me her own vegetarian meal! I felt so well treated! Big carriers should learn something from Kulula!

It was really a new experience flying Kulula. Our flights from DUR-PLZ and from CPT to JNB were absolutely perfect for a so called low-price carrier. Friendly and nice staff and safe and clean aircraft. (B732 and MD 80). Check-in was fast and correct and the flights were relaxing and full of good sense of humor. Back in SA we would fly Kulula again and again. Best choice!

Durban to Cape Town. Checked in 2 hours before the flight and was told that there were no window seats left. Had to settle for the aisle. The flight was OK but I kept getting bumped by the drinks trolley. Seats were an ugly green and very tatty on this MD 80 aircraft. On the return I was early so decided to check in. I was told I was too early and I should come back 2 hours before check-in. Sorry if that is your policy you have lost a customer. I promptly left your check-in and checked in with a competitor and could check-in early. Incidentally Kulula prices are no longer that competitive and I find better prices elsewhere.

Great airline with its excellent prices and cabin crew very professional but still had a sense of humour and pride in the service offered. Good to feel a valued customer again and not just a number. Both flights on very clean MD80's on time and comfortable

JNB-CPT return for less than ZAR1000. Both flights were on time the cabin crew were friendly and helpful. Check-in was efficient and at JNB they had a separate line for passengers with hand luggage only. The only point of complaint is the choice of colours for the seats. Lime green and blue is not a happy combination in my opinion.

### Kulula customer review
On our honeymoon to SA we flew Kulula from Durban to Cape Town. Friendly and very helpful BA-staff in Durban asking if I'd like to have an exit seat being 6'7ft this is usually the seat I am sitting in. It takes a while to get used to the bright green interior and the green shirts and blue jeans of the cabin crew but service was friendly sandwiches were tasty and prices for the snacks were moderate. Flight took almost two hours and crew offered trolley services twice. Baggage was delivered within five minutes after arrival in CPT. I would choose that "cool" airline again next time it is refreshingly different!

### Kulula customer review
I took 2 Kulula flights on my recent trip to South Africa and must say I had mixed feelings about the airline. Although both flight (JNB-CPT and George-JNB) were dirt cheap you could see that it is a low-cost airline. I mean I don't want to complain there is nothing to complain about it is just that I was watching the cabin crew who were VERY young. On my way from George to JNB 3 of the young girls who were suppose to help passengers with boarding procedures were flirting with one guy! They were standing at his seat one with her foot on the empty seat chatting with him! They were unfriendly to the other passengers or totally ignored us standing in the way so that it was difficult for us to reach our seats. The snacks were also not that cheap as stated below. Then the cockpit door was open during the whole flight from George to JNB!!! What about safety? Talking about safety instructions I know they are trying to make it a bit funny but I just couldn't get myself to laugh. All in all it was OK but next time I will try the other low cost airline 1Time first before flying with Kulula again.
