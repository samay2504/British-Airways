### "had a fabulous experience"
Not Verified |  I recently flew with Alaska and had the best service. Comfortable seats, wifi and connectivity was excellent, there was no entertainment screen but I was able to watch movies on my laptop and the choices were excellent. Food was excellent, cabin was clean, landing/departure was on time and relaxing, the flight was on time, value for money was awesome, ground service was awesome. I had a fabulous experience with Alaska airlines and will fly with them again!

### "offers food for advance purchase"
Mediocre. Planes from Chicago to Seattle are old with tiny overhead bins so if you have a backpack (which is all I carried on because I checked a bag), they make you shove it under the seat in front of you. Flight attendants ok, not super friendly, in the four legs I took. Premium economy offers food for advance purchase - it wasn’t bad. Leg room decent in premium. $8 WiFi is a good deal and it worked nicely. Flights were all on time.

### "customer service is among the worst"
Not Verified | I recently had a frustrating experience with Alaska Airlines. First, you can’t check in at their kiosk; instead, you have to sign in and scan a QR code. I paid baggage fees, but never received a receipt. To get it, you have to scan yet another QR code, but even after I did, it didn’t work. I’ve called customer service four times to resolve the issue, but each time I’m transferred or put on hold indefinitely with no resolution. As a frequent traveler for work, I can confidently say that Alaska Airlines' customer service is among the worst I’ve encountered. Very disappointing.

### "experience was incredibly disappointing"
I recently flew from Maui to San Francisco, and unfortunately, my experience was incredibly disappointing. The flight itself was a routine 4-hour trip, but midway through, I had boiling water spilled on me by a flight attendant. The burn caused significant pain, and I had to endure the rest of the flight in excruciating discomfort. What made this experience even worse was the complete lack of care or follow-up from the airline. Not only did I receive no apology, but I wasn’t offered any form of compensation, assistance, or even acknowledgment of the incident. To make matters worse, I was not refunded for the flight, despite the severe pain I endured. Flying should be a safe and comfortable experience, but unfortunately, this flight left me feeling ignored and mistreated. I sincerely hope the airline takes this seriously and improves their customer care and safety protocols in the future.

### "The staff were all unfriendly"
Not Verified | Our inbound flight from Seattle was delayed almost 30 minutes, we pushed back from the gate 50 minutes late. When we landed in Seattle we were told that we would be able to make our very tight connecting flight without issue. We made it to the connecting gate at 15:38- notably before the 15:40 scheduled departure of our flight to Missoula. Unfortunately our gate was already closed and we were informed the next flight was six hours later. The staff were all unfriendly, putting us in a loop of people deflecting the blame to the next people and leaving us without any options. We asked for any sort of compensation for the entire day they have wasted but were told there was nothing anyone could do. I genuinely pray that I never have to fly this airline again. T

### "luggage was lost/delayed"
Not Verified |  The service on the flights is great. Free movies and texting. Pay for full wifi. The flight crew we're very friendly. However, our luggage was lost/delayed during our 11.25 hour overnight layover in Seattle. The Seattle-Tacoma Airport had issues with their sorting systems, but with so much time between flights and it being an overnight layover, the lost/delayed luggage seems rather unacceptable. Compensation was not offered upon arrival at our final destination until I asked about it. The airline sent an email telling us about the issues at the Seattle airport, 6 hours after we had already checked our bags and were enroute to Seattle. Extremely disappointed in the handling of our belongings which included gifts purchased while on vacation and medications.

### "The worst experience"
The worst experience I’ve ever had with an airline. We were set to fly out at 9am and we got notified around 4am our flight was canceled, not delayed, fully canceled. We immediately called customer support and it was a 4 hour wait. We got a call back around 11am and they said there are no other flights going out and they were not sure when another one would go out to Seattle. We tried later in the evening to check if any flights were available and there were a few but all $500+ per ticket (triple what we paid) and had a full day layover. We would waste half our trip trying to just catch a flight out. We had no other option but to cancel the entire trip and try to get refunds. Within their contract they are responsible to put us on the next outgoing flight and they failed to do so. Support was not any help and often rude about the situation. We’re still waiting on our refund from the airline and still trying to get a refund from our hotel we booked too.

### “crews are unhelpful”
I had a bad experience on the airplane. The seat is uncomfortable it can’t be adjusted, lavatory is dirty and stinky. The crews are unhelpful, comparing to other airlines, this airline is not worth paying at all.

### "Worst experience ever"
Not Verified |   Worst experience ever accompanied by the highest negligence. Tried to take a weekend vacation and it was absolutely destroyed by this company. They put the wrong gate and destination name was reversed to what was on the board. I was sent to the other side of the airport to a gate they didn’t use that took a half hour dragging luggage, then running back with it after it was determined that they printed the wrong gate on the ticket. Name on the ticket for the destination was San Lucas Cabo while on the board was Los Cabo as you can imagine not under C nor S. Missed the flight and their customer service rep couldn’t help herself but to continue raising her voice although I reminded numerous times to lower it and keep it leveled with mine, after all she wasn’t the one that missed her flight and had to run around the airport. Charged me to rebook the flight the next day, wouldn’t cover or compensate hotel nor car rides for being stuck in a different city. Then found out that they had misspelled my name on the rebooked ticket that took over an hour on the phone to fix. But the fun didn’t stop there, while I had paid for premium that included checking bags, they didn’t have the same level the next day but while not willing to refund the difference even, charged a me for checking in the bag. Still not done with their shenanigans, the next day, after we waited in line to go through security, once we made it there, the flight they had assigned to my wife’s passport was different than the one showing on the app so couldn’t go through, had to get out of the line and go wait on the checking bag line to get it fixed then go back to the security line to go through. Proof of the ticket and events were provided to their customer service and a week after supposed review, they admitted the fault and their offer was $250 credit towards the next flight with them, my tickets were over $2,000 for both of us. You couldn’t pay me enough to fly with this company. If this is the last choice to fly, I’m staying home.

### "never fly this airline again"
Not Verified |   I had a horrible experience with this airline. The seats were pretty standard and the legroom was very tight. The were not that friendly either. I would never fly this airline again

### "TRIPLE charged me for my suitcase"
One of the airline employees at check-in was rude and TRIPLE charged me for my suitcase. She made 2 of the charges under bogus flight codes so Alaska Airlines employees “can’t find” the charges to cancel them. They blame my bank and take no responsibility for their own incompetent employees. So basically, I was overcharged $200 (billed $300 for 1 bag which should’ve been $100). If you must fly Alaska, be prepared for huge unnecessary bills and rude employees.

### "used to be much better"
Not Verified |   My wife just returned from a conference in Nashville using Alaska Airlines #1269. Alaska used to be a much better airline as far as service, cleanliness and simple amenities. Her flight had a filthy bathroom (sometmes that happens) and one that had not been cleaned well for a LONG time. When you enter the bathroom and there is mold around the switches and sliders and mold on some of the contact surfaces you know that this plane had not a had a decent cleaning for many days or months. We used to prefer Alaska but lately we look for JetBlue, Delta and SW itineraries first.

### "avoid this airline at all costs"
We experienced 2 delays with the total just under 3 hours. We weren’t notified a single time. Denied lounge access as they had changed their policy after we had already booked our first class tickets with the intention of using the lounge. No meal vouchers offered during prolonged delay. Once on board our seats were dirty and not sanitised according to covid standards. Seats were covered in crumbs from past passenger, menus were torn and covered in food. Staff could not confirm if our special order meals were dairy free even though we had specially selected them for allergy reason. There was no access to entertainment and this could not be troubleshot. Our bags were not placed as priority so we were even later for the commitment we were attending. Customer service were very unhelpful and unsympathetic. They offered us a future discount code but we are not from America so it is of no use to us. We would not use this. I offered to be reimbursed with partnership flight miles to which they declined. Do your future self a favour and avoid this airline at all costs.

### “customer service refused to hear me out”
As a handicapped mobility challenged paraplegic veteran I most recently was charged $150 extra for a luggage charge on one bag that carried my prosthetic mechanical leg braces, and catheters and misc. Other medical equipment I require. I was told there is no waiver for medical items and the customer service refused to hear me out. I was willing to open the bag and show them but to no avail and I was charged. I'm sick to my stomach thinking about it as I'm prepared to finish this trip on Alaska Airlines.

### "Do not trust Alaska Airlines"
Not Verified |   I traveled with Alaska Airlines on 06/27/2023 from Los Angeles to Washington. I had a terrible in flight experience as well as afterwards when trying to relay my concerns with the airline about my experience. In flight, they did not honor my first class ticket because first class was full. They also destroyed my luggage. I tried to negotiate with them for the damages for almost a year. Eventually I had to take them to court and I got judgement against them for the damages. Do not trust Alaska Airlines.

### "customer service was horrible"
Not Verified |   Worst airline ever!? They even have Spirit beat by a long shot. This was my first time flying them. Never again! Someone else booked my ticket and accidentally booked 6am instead of 9am. I have to work the night before and don't get off till 7am. Tried to call the airline to get a simple time change and was willing to pay any difference and they absolutely refused. The customer service was horrible. No people skills. I don't know why anyone would give this airline their money. I understand no refunds

### "terrible experience every time"
I have a terrible experience every time I use Alaska. Last summer I flew home from Vegas and for whatever reason, the flight was delayed after we all boarded. So we sat on the tarmac for a freaking hour in the Vegas heat. Then I got my luggage from baggage claim and it was damaged. A big hole in the side of my Samsonite luggage. When I try to report it, they wasn’t a receipt for what I paid. What person has a two year old receipt? Are you kidding me. Got delayed three times on my way to San Diego, and  I’m delayed again trying to get home. I am so over this airline. I only use them because I get free miles, but I’d much rather pay for something reliable. Never again

### "no refund of anything"
I put a sign on one of my carry-on bags, warning about a (fictitious) anti-theft device with an alarm inside of it, just to discourage bag-snatchers. TSA didn’t have any problem with the sign being on my bag, nor with what it said. Airport security at both BLI and SEATAC didn’t have any problem with it. No one at all on the first flight from Bellingham to Seattle (also Alaska Airlines) had any problem with it. And no one at the boarding gate in SEATAC had any problem with it. Then, when I got on the plane, as I was getting to my seat (at the back of the plane), a flight attendant asked me about it. I told them, then took the sign off of my bag and put it away - just in case - stored said bag in the overhead compartment, and took my seat. Two other attendants then came and asked me about the now removed sign, one at a time, and I repeated my explanation to each of them. A fourth attendant then came, and asked me to bring my bags “up front to discuss them” . This was a lie, as, when I reached the front, they walked me off of the plane, and told me that several passengers were “uncomfortable” with the sign. They then re-booked me, without my input, to a much later flight, which would cause me to miss the wedding I was supposed to give the toast at. After talking with Guest Services, I decided to head back home to Bellingham so that I could at least give the toast over FaceTime. However, doing so required the approval of two different supervisors in Guest Services at SEATAC to make happen, because the Customer Service rep (in Phoenix) said that they could neither change anything about the bookings nor refund anyof the round-trip ticket because of the first re-booking - despite the fact that said re-booking was done without my input. Regarding the two supervisors, the first confirmed that no noise-making capable devices are allowed on the plane, and the second said that signs such as mine that “might make some people uncomfortable” are not allowed either. Not that you’ll find either of those statements on the airline’s website, of course - I checked. And given that nobody on the first flight even mentioned it to me, I have my doubts about whether or not this was “official” Alaska Airlines policy. Long story short, don’t fly Alaska. They (apparently) reserve the right to selectively impose new rules based solely on people’s feelings, even if it disenfranchises their paying customers - and some of them will even lie to do so. Just to be clear, at NO point did anyone say anything about any Federal or State laws, nor was security ever involved, so I’m pretty sure what happened was all on Alaska. Including the fact that I’m getting nothing back from them - no refund of anything, nor even a voucher, not that I’d use the latter - in exchange for having my flight yanked out from under me.

### "a very upsetting experience"
My family and I recently had a very upsetting experience with Alaska Airlines. Our Alaska Airlines flight was cancelled (no reason for the cancelation was given; it certainly was not weather-related) which caused us to miss our connecting international flight. No other flights were available that day, so we would reach our final destination 24 hours late. Consequently, we not only missed one full day of vacation, but we also incurred significant costs as we had to book a hotel room at the airport as well as another hotel room at the airport of our destination since we missed the ferry to get to our vacation rental. Not to mention that we lost out on our car and room reservations we already had and which we could now not utilize. Even though we, and especially our little son, were very sad and disappointed to miss one full day of our vacation, we stayed very patient. I am a frequent traveler and understand that these things can happen. When however, on the way back our Alaska Airlines flight was cancelled again, our patience ran thin. No other Alaska Airlines flight for the same day was available, so they had to reroute us to another airport which meant the additional expense for a long Uber ride plus a longer way home from the airport. When this flight was then delayed for more than three hours – we would now be home at three in the morning – I decided to go to the Alaska Airlines Lounge to ask for support. My son was exhausted and I wanted to see if we could sit down in the lounge for the long wait time, since it was freezing cold in the terminal. We didn’t even ask for food or beverages, just a place to sit more comfortably and warm, until our flight would leave. When the lady at the front desk of the Alaska Airlines Lounge refused any help and informed me that I would still have to pay a $30 fee per person, I was literally in tears – she showed no compassion at all! I asked if we could at least borrow a couple of blankets to get warm in the terminal, this was denied as well. Due to these two cancelled flights, we incurred additional costs close to $1,000 (for several hotel rooms, transfer costs, supplies, etc. ), we lost one day of vacation on the way out and arrived home much, much later than planned. During this whole experience, Alaska Airlines did not provide any sort of support or compensation. I will never use their so-called “services” again and I advise strongly against flying with this airline, they do not show any consideration for their customers, not even children.

### "blown away by the service"
Not Verified | Absolutely blown away by the service that I received - if you're looking to possibly fly with him or have options I would highly suggest booking them. I've flown many airlines and this is the first one that actually treated you like a customer down to earth employees and their flight attendants are actually extremely warm and welcoming

### "lackluster at best"
The flight attendants on my flight were lackluster at best. I was skipped over not once, but both times they passed by to provide snacks and drinks. Both times they blamed not being able to hear. This was my first time on Alaska Airlines and I'll have to be hard pressed to give them another try. Less than impressive experience for an already bad circumstance. I do not recommend them. Be ready to speak up and have the aisle seat folks ready to advocate for you. The attendants will ignore you.

### "Just really going downhill"
Not Verified |   First class services are stopping. No water, no glass, coffee cups, no snack basket, 1 drink if there is time in the 1.5 hour flight. Just really going downhill. They will lose customers with this cheap tactic.

### “I use this airline sparingly”
I had a bad experience on my return trip from Ft Lauderdale to Portland. The weather at FLL was rainy, but not terrible. Planes were departing and arriving. After pulling back from the gate we sat motionless for 15 minutes or so. The pilot came on to tell us we had a shortage of fuel, and this was due to the weather and it's impact to availability of fuel. We sat for another 30-45 minutes. During this time the pilot said due to the fuel shortage we would stop in Kansas City on our way to Seattle. After about an hour on the ground in FLL he came on again to apologize for the paperwork being very slow, some corrections that needed to be made to the new flight plans. The delays caused us to be 4 hours late in arriving in Seattle. Here's the problem with Alaska - 1. They lied to us. They don't prioritize honesty with their customers. The fuel shortage scenario he tried to explain was weak at best. It was raining = not enough fuel? Alaska sent me an email apologizing for the stop in KC, but said it was unavoidable due to stronger than expected headwinds. What really happened? Lot of us lost time and $ due to this. The official determination was wind, so no reimbursements for hotels or added costs to rebook. 2. they had a service failure followed by inability to make a service recovery. They were not prepared to handle the onslaught of people who needed help. A desk was there, we were not told where, we had to find it. 4 agents were there; they needed 10 to quickly deal with the problems. Seattle is their headquarters! They had 6 hours to prepare! I use this airline sparingly and will continue to do so. I have 1.8MM miles on Delta. I'm with them because they don't let stuff like this happen. They are professional, honest with their customers, and I've never been lied to.

### "I will be avoiding Alaska Airlines"
Literally the only airline that won't let you in their lounge if you have a business class ticket. Even if you have a first class ticket you have to pay extra. Ridiculous. I will be avoiding Alaska Airlines at all.

### "flight was delayed both ways"
I had round trip tickets from Portland to Vegas, my flight was delayed both ways. Flight to Vegas was delayed 4 hours. My flight to Portland was delayed an hour so the crew could sleep. I understand sleep but you would have thought they could have posted the delay the night prior so the passengers could sleep as well but nope. Ridiculous!

### "first class customer service"
Not Verified | On a business trip to Spokane, Washington, my return trip to Boise, Idaho was scheduled to leave at 12:30 in the afternoon. I arrived at the airport quite early and noticed they had an early flight at 9:00am. I asked the gate agent if I could switch my flight to the earlier one. The flight was light so they let me switch, at no cost, and they upgraded my economy seat to a first class seat, at no cost. This is what I call first class customer service. Good show Alaska Airlines!

### "deeply unsatisfactory"
Not Verified | Poor customer service and deceiving practices I recently had an extremely disappointing experience with Alaska Airlines' phone customer service. The representatives seemed uninterested in assisting, frequently hanging up the call or leaving me on indefinite hold. This neglect is unacceptable, particularly when travelers are seeking crucial information. Furthermore, there were misleading communications about flight delays. I was informed that my flight couldn't depart due to weather issues, yet there were no apparent weather problems. It's troubling to suspect that this may be a tactic to mask the mechanical issues with their older aircraft fleet. The apparent strategy of avoiding compensation by falsely attributing delays to weather is deceptive and unacceptable. Customers deserve honesty and transparency, especially when it concerns their travel plans. I strongly advise travelers to reconsider flying with Alaska Airlines. Their lack of responsible customer service and questionable operational practices warrant scrutiny. In summary, my experience with Alaska Airlines was deeply unsatisfactory, marked by poor communication and suspect practices. I urge potential passengers to be cautious and consider other airlines for their travel needs.

### "Everything was just fabulous"
Not Verified | First time flying Alaska such a excellent experience! Everything was just fabulous. Happy to visit Oregon for the first time to celebrate my birthday 11/26.

### "Messed up airline"
Not Verified |  Attempted to send my dog to Nashville, Alaska has canceled the flight twice, now they say I will need to spend another $200 on vet because the health certificate is only valid for 10 days. I will unfortunately be required to dyebib small claims to recover all of these vet costs that were required for the flights that were canceled. Do not rely on these idiots. The lady behind the counter just sat there grinning at me and refusing to speak to me. Messed up staff. Messed up airline. Avoid.

### "agents who obviously care so much"
Alaska Airlines has shown up for us in so many different ways on so many occasions that I felt I really just had to share how grateful I am to have such a quality airline up here. Thank you to the agents who obviously care so much.

### “communication was sorely lacking”
I recently flew with Alaska Airlines from Seattle to San Francisco and was dismayed by a 3-hour delay. Not only did this disruption cause significant inconvenience, but the communication from the airline was also sorely lacking, leaving passengers confused and frustrated. As a result of this experience, I'll try avoiding my future flights bookings from Alaska Airlines. If you want to have a reliable flight then I would recommend avoiding Alaska Airlines.

### "Never encountered ruder gate workers"
Not Verified |  Never encountered ruder gate workers. They spoke to every customer like they were annoying children. I asked a question regarding my seat, I was asked to come back in an hour. When I returned an hour later the lady started to help me and the guy next to her screamed that he had already told me once to come back later. Which I had done. Uncomfortable and unnecessary. It’s not hard to talk to people nicely and give clear instructions. Saving grace is in flight outlets, wifi and cabin crew. Food is terrible.

### "Our check-in bag was badly damaged"
Not Verified |  Our check-in bag was badly damaged. After documenting and filing a report, Alaska returned with an offer of $100. This is not enough to replace our current size bag let alone any hard case bag. I called them up and ask how am how suppose to replace my large hard luggage for $100, All they could say was that it was there policy that if you don't have a receipt of luggage purchase they only refund $100. Yet they couldn't show me where it says that on their policy. I was on another airline and they let me choose a replacement bag. I would really not recommend flying with them if you need to check your bag in!

### "never book again with Alaska Airlines"
No business lounge or pay for it. Seats are terrible, no leg room 6 hrs sitting in a glorified armchair. Terrible food will never book again with Alaska Airlines.

### "I could not get on the plane"
The initial flight from Orlando was 1 hour and 40 minutes late. While I understand the crew has a specific amount of sleep assigned, that policy is not passed down to their patrons. I missed my connecting flight to Eugene Oregon because of the crew’s right to sleep, causing a 13 hour delay because there was not another flight until midnight. The parties that were to pick me up had to make the 2 hour drive from Seal Rock 2x that day. Returning, I arrived at the Eugene airport at 6:30 pm on 10/10/23 because My son and his wife had to work and could not provide transportation on 10/11/23 when my flight was scheduled. I tried to sleep but was told to move to the lobby. This caused me to go through TSA 2x. The automated announcement railed every few minutes incessantly about unattended baggage. The floor was cleaned for what felt like hours. No sleep may have been to be expected. My ticket listed Gate F, which does not exist. The telemonitor said Gate A4. Loading started at 12:59. I got concerned about 1:00 because I heard nothing. The flight was at Gate B1. I got there by 1:06 and was told that I had to reschedule. I arrived in Seattle at approximately 6, tired and unrested. I went to one of the restaurants for dinner. From 6:30-10:30 while waiting on the flight to Orlando, I ate and drank 4 glasses of wine. I still have gotten any sleep. My flight did not leave until 10:20 pm. I arrived, was allowed on, and sat down glad to have an opportunity to sleep. That would not happen. The FA said to come with her. I complied. The staff at the desk told me that I stumbled therefore I could not get on the plane. I hadn't been belligerent, aggressive, or bothered anyone. I argued with him for a moment. He had already called the police. I left the vicinity. The staff said my ticket would be refunded in 5-7 business days. I had only $130 and other tickets were running at min $400. I sat in the Seattle Airport all night because nothing was open and I did not know what to do. Staff saw me again Thurs. am, again with no sleep, and again called the cops on me, assumingly because he decided that I was not to be on the premises. I answered to the police that I had had a ticket, that I had a right to be there, and I would appreciate them not bothering me. I called Customer Service. No assistance. I went to the Alaskan CS Desk and spoke with Anthony. He was very helpful. Derrick, his Supervisor, very professional, said that he could not override the decision to allow me to fly with Alaska Airlines due to what that staff wrote in his report - I had harassed staff & become aggressive with the police, which is clearly not true if you review the camera footage I asked where I should stay and Derrick told me anywhere it did not interfere with their employment. Of which I agreed, stating that I had not done that previously. I told Derrick that he needed to tell his employee to stop calling the police on me. Due only to borrowing money from my 82 year old mother, I finally arrived at MCO airport at 10:30 am Fri am . I went to get my baggage CS They were locked. I called Alaska Airline CS again and was told that I would have to wait until 2:30 pm. At 2:45 pm there was still no employee there.

### "Best airline I have flown"
Best airline I have flown with. The staff were very friendly and the seating was perfect, sitting only two to a row was much more enjoyable for me than sitting three to a row. Captain and flight attendants were very communicative about the delay experienced on the flight home, and did a good job at making sure the passengers felt comfortable. Will be flying with Alaska Air again in the future.

### "This was a huge disappointment"
Not Verified |  Flight was delayed several hours, I believe due to staffing issues. We were issued a 12.00 food voucher and 75.00 travel voucher. Our friends who took the LAX to ZIH received 125.00 travel voucher. While I appreciate the gesture, Alaska agent's reasoning was not informative. I fly Alaska minimum of 4 round trips annually and have been happy with the service. This was a huge disappointment.

### "most rude customer service agent"
A lead member running the Seattle to Reno flight on Sunday evening at 8:55 out of Aeatac airport was the most rude customer service agent I have ever endured. I got to the gate 20 min before takeoff and asked to switch my flight, he said no, I offered to purchase a whole new ticket, he said no. I went online and showed him i was buying a ticket and they were available, he said i will refuse to allow you to board “don’t waste your money you’re not getting on” and then let 3 more people board after. It was a horrible experience and i will never fly Alaska out of Seattle again. That was a nightmare, they kept moving the goalposts as to why i couldn't get on.

### "was pleasantly surprised"
I was expecting very little and was pleasantly surprised. Boarding was orderly, greeting was welcoming and seat was standard but perfectly comfortable for a 5 hour trip. Great inexpensive Wi Fi was available which is rare out of Kona these days. Sole flight attendant up front worked her tail off in a gracious, efficient manner which is also rare these days. The meal was as good as it gets and the option to pre order online was appreciated. Honestly, I’ve avoided the Max until now and still wonder about its safety but the experience was comfortable and above par. Compared to similar recent flights on Delta, United, and American, this was, by far the best.

### "worst airline I have ever flown"
Not Verified |  Delayed in DC 4 hours for the weather, ok no problem, but by the time they rebooked me my total flight time went from 29 hours to 59 hours. A total of 30 extra hours than my original booking. Plus I lost all the seats I paid for in original booking and had random seats. Alaska airlines cost me time on vacation time with my family and 30 extra hours. Alaska airlines is the worst airline I have ever flown and I've flown spirit and southwest.

### "Very very stressful"
Alaska cancelled our flight from Vancouver and Cancun when doing an online check in on August 27. Next day early morning flight. No email received. We called back a few hours later and were put on a connecting flight via AA (Dallas). Same thing on return flight on September 1st. Just cancelled, no alternatives given. After a few phone calls (and a cut short vacation trip), they put us on a connecting flight via Austin TX and had to pay for baggage again- even though the agent told us it was otherwise. In short, we were left on our own to sort things out, we were on the edge of cancelling our entire trip because no one one offered us any alternatives. I'll give them a zero rating for what they did to us - for a trip we had planned with our kids. Very very stressful and will probably never use this airline anymore.

### "I am very confused and disappointed"
Not Verified |  The flight was fine. I choose Alaska because I find them reliable. My issue is regarding their lost and found. I left my phone onboard the plane. My fault I know. Maybe 20 - 30min after I leave the plane, I was in seat 9D so I was one of the first to offload. I immediately seek assistance. The baggage claim agent on 9/02, did a lot to try and help me. He tried calling the crew/gate agent or the cleaning service to see if they could look for my phone. We told me that everyone was gone because it was a late flight. Early in the morning is when the plane will be searched and cleaned for its next flight. I return on 9/03 to baggage claim to see if anything was turned in. These were of no help. They told me to file a claim (I did that the night before). They asked me to call the customer service number, I said with what phone? I stayed at the desk for 40 min on hold. Tried asking the baggage claim manager for assistance, she laughed and walked away. According to my find your phone, my phone was in Reno then California and now Mexico. I kept trying to have an agent contact the crew or gate agents so that my seat could be thoroughly checked. I was told there is no way to connect this people. Which I find strange. If the pilot's parents died, no one can contact them to give the news? I think not. Currently, I was told that my phone was not on the San Fran Return flight and may still be in Mexico. The issue is the lack of efficiency and protocol for lost items. If the plane was thoroughly checked on 9/02, my phone would be in Seattle (where I am). If it was thoroughly check in Reno or Bakersfield my phone would be closer to being returned to me. Now its in Mexico? I have asked multiple agents what happens when my phone is not returned? What is my compensation? No one has answered my questions. I am very confused and disappointed with this process. Its also very clear the planes are not cleaned or inspected between flights. Attached are photos of my phones journey. Seattle Pic is where my phone was when we landed to our destination in Seattle. The Mexico Pic: Is where my phone is/was, again after they "clean" and thoroughly check the planes.

### "Customer service is useless"
I would give them zero stars if I could. They let us board the plane departing to a very time sensitive trip, then told us (ON the plane) they wouldn't check our luggage. Our options at that point were either get off the plane (completely miss the trip departing in AK) and reschedule for a later date or hope that in 30 seconds we could find someone to come get our things because they refused to hold it. I've flown over 100 times in my life and never have experienced such backwards treatment. After 6 weeks of absurd emailing and calling customer service nonstop, they finally sent an email that basically told us to get lost. Customer service is useless and the whole process from the moment we walked into the airport to the moment we got home was laughable. RUDE CLUELESS employees and a careless company to back it. We wasted THOUSANDS of dollars trying to fix their mistake and salvage our trip because they couldn't do their job. I will never fly Alaskan again and I hope no one else does either. Airlines are bad enough crooks as it is but this was just plain wrong.

### "didn't even cover the extra cost of premium"
Bought "premium" seats so I could recline and be more comfortable for 12 hours of flying. The guy behind me kept hitting my seat so hard it was lurching me forward. Alaska Air said all they would do was issue a measly $100.00 credit towards my next flight. That didn't even cover the extra cost of "premium". On top of all of that, they destroyed all 3 of our fish box coolers and our fish was all unthawed. Needless to say they can take their $100.00 credit and shove it! Especially if you have fresh seafood or anything that needs to be kept cool!

### "worst possible wheelchair service"
I had requested wheelchair assist for my mom and we arrived well ahead of time to the airport. I just received the worst ever possible wheelchair service at Seattle Tacoma airport, with the lady at the front desk, not even lending us a wheelchair for me to push. After wasting our time at the wheelchair desk for 10-15 mins of no service, we decided to walk. While in queue we unfortunately asked one of the least knowledgeable person about where we could find a wheelchair and he dragged us with him for yet another 20 some minutes while he didn't he even know, where to find the answers or solution to our situation. Thus, we were delayed and missed one flight. At the gate the lady didn't even offer to book on the next available but booked us on the last flight for the day. We had to call Alaska customer care center to have our flights to the next closet available flight. It's been an hour since I requested a wheelchair for gate transfer and we are still waiting. I would never ever use Alaska airlines wheelchair service ever in my life. Terrible! !

### "Be very careful before booking"
Be very careful before booking with Alaska. On my recent trip the flight was canceled and I received no notice (no text, email or call) about the cancellation. I found out about it when I arrived at the airport just like everyone else who was on that flight. The employees at the gate were very friendly and did their best to accommodate everyone and book new flights. My flight was rebooked (for two days later) and I ended up missing out on two nights at a hotel I booked in LA. After a few calls and emails with Alaska, they informed me I would not be reimbursed for the nights I missed at the hotel because of their cancellation. Do not assume things will go according to plan when you book with Alaska, make sure you have insurance and a plan B because you probably don't want to lose $263 because of their mistake, like I did. Money down the drain.

### "so grateful for the kind service"
Not Verified |  I am so grateful for the kind service I received at every point from Alaska airlines employees. They really went over and above to help me when I needed it, including when I missed my return flight. They were caring and quickly solved my problem with a later flight. Thank you from the bottom of my heart!

### "they made people wait outside in a 90° heat"
This is not my first time flying on Alaskan Airlines. I've never had any problems before, this time flying from Hawaii back to San Diego made me frustrated because of flight attendants, at the time of the boarding the plane they made people wait outside in a 90° heat twice, just because they were serving alcohol to the first class passengers. I do not mind to wait inside the plane in shady conditions, then wait outside for 10+ minutes. Tickets are not cheap and we should be respected as a human being no matter what class/group we are sitting.

### "such rude irresponsible behavior"
Not Verified |  Horrible irresponsible flight attendant. When I arrived to my seat there was a juice trash on chair, a diaper trash on my foot space. When i asked the flight attendant to pick the trash, he asked me if they’re mine and I said no, he said he’ll come later. He came later and asked me to give them to him, I asked for a tissue since i was not comfortable touching it, he said never mind, he’ll pick it up after take off. Checked my time, more than one and a half hour through flight, he came by to pick up drink cups, I asked him and he said since you don’t want to touch them (some one else’s trash), he will pick them after we landed (4:36 flight). I asked him to wait so i could find tissue from my bag, and that I do not wish to have smelly diaper during my entire flight in front of me, then he started laughing, and speaking very loud while turning his head around having eye contact with other passengers that: “Calm down, calm down, I’m just trying to be kind to you and help you out here”. In what planet asking a passenger who paid more than $1200 for her flight, to sit on seat with three trashes one being a dirty diaper, and asking her to keep them there during entire flight time is being kind to a person and helping that person. I completely disassociated with him once he raised his voice since I knew he is waiting for me to say something. I have never encountered such rude irresponsible behavior from flight attendants. I have to say the pilot took off and landed very good and other flight attendants were nice.

### "Great service from start to finish"
Great service from start to finish. My bag was broken and I went to the bag service area they gave me a temporary bag and helped me with some advice to get around NYC. Glorylis was a great customer service person! The flight was comfortable enough for Economy Class, and service was great, the air hosts were amazing and lovely people.

### "Horrible check in process"
Not Verified | Horrible check in process. Rude people behind the counter. Refused to assist with lifting baggage and seemed bothered by assisting with tagging luggage. No inflight entertainment or meals onboard a 5 hour flight. I will never fly Alaska Airlines again.

### "informed that we were 10 minutes late"
I am writing this post to express my deep disappointment and frustration with the unprofessional treatment and poor customer service we experienced during a recent flight with Alaska Airlines. As loyal customers, my wife and I had planned a trip that was months in the making, with multiple reservations and arrangements in place. Our ordeal began when we approached the check-in counter and were informed that we were 10 minutes late. We politely sought assistance and an understanding of the situation from the front desk representative, but we were directed to speak to the Manager. However, instead of offering guidance or explaining the airline's policies, she displayed a complete lack of empathy and customer service skills. She was dismissive and outright rude, showing no willingness to help us despite the circumstances of our slight delay due to a long check-in line. We expected better treatment and a more supportive approach, especially from a manager. Her refusal to consider any alternative solutions and her insistence on offering only one inconvenient option left us feeling disrespected and devalued as customers. To our shock, the Manager canceled our entire trip without any valid reason or explanation, leaving us in tears and feeling completely helpless. Her action disrupted our meticulously planned vacation, including connected flights and multiple reservations, causing immense distress and frustration. During the entire interaction, we maintained our composure and never resorted to using inappropriate language, as the airline staff alleged. Instead, we were met with passive and dismissive responses from the supervisor when we sought her understanding and assistance in rectifying the situation. As loyal customers, we expected better treatment and support from Alaska Airlines when facing challenging situations. Unfortunately, this experience has severely shaken our trust and confidence in the airline's commitment to customer satisfaction.

### "Worst airline ever"
Not Verified |  Worst airline ever. Rude attendants. Very disrespectful. Will never in my life will I fly via their company. I don’t recommend anyone to fly with them .

### "friendly and courteous cabin crew"
Had an amazing four and a half hours flight from Indy to SeaTac. Everything went like clockwork. Only two Alaska flights operate from Ind to Seattle daily so the check-in counters were empty. Boarding on time, arrival on time. The most impressive part was friendly and courteous cabin crew which is rare to find these days in economy at least. Would definitely fly with them if I get a chance.

### "Terrible service"
Terrible service when you call them to get help with the minor. Agent on the phone was extremely rude. No help at all. Referred me to the website. Traveling with a minor, meeting help, getting seats together or what needed to be done. Would not recommend this airline if traveling with minors.

### "wifi didn’t work for our flight"
Not Verified |  This airline has decent seats, with recline and adjustable head rests, and the food/drinks are average. Alaska is a cheap airline, but rarely delays our flights, except on this flight when the crew didn’t arrive in time. Sadly, they don’t offer any of their own entertainment except on their website, and the wifi didn’t work for our flight.

### "no guarantee to be seated with children"
Not Verified | Horrible customer service - was guaranteed BEFORE booking that my minor children would be sat with either myself or my husband. Once they got my money they would not change the seats on multiple attempts the month prior to flying. Then at the gate the agents were rude. All 4 flights I had an issue having my very small children (who had never flown before and were half asleep because of a night flight) seated with me. I ended up having to ask people to switch and do it myself. Customer service is HORRIBLE. Absolutely absurd responses. The “benefits” they offer with the credit card is not worth the rudeness of staff, issues with flying, being lied to about having my kids sit with me, refusing to fix it, terrible customer service responses and oh here’s a $50 voucher for your next flight that costs $1200 and if you use the voucher you can’t use the companion fare. No thanks. Horrible airline. Don’t recommend to anyone. Also previous flight my husband flew alone he had other issues. We are changing credit cards and airlines after this experience and ridiculous customer service responses. Just FYI. They are now saying there’s no guarantee to be seated with minor children (mine are 3, 5 and 6)

### "carpet was so dirty"
Not Verified | Never again! My ticket was messed up, I had to take a later flight and sit in the airport for 3 hours, replacement flight was in main cabin when I paid for 1st class, and the plane was SO DISGUSTING. The carpet was so dirty and sticky, it it pulled my shoe off. I cant believe this airline operates this way.

### "have the audacity to be truthful"
Booked a round trip with this company for a family ER. First flight crew was great. Returning Flight I had an altercation with their senior flight attendant who had a disgusting behavior and escalated a situation that could've easily been handled by proper customer service and communication. I approached her and another flight attendant to use the restrooms when it was last call for restrooms use. I was coldly told by both to use the back restrooms where there was a huge line. I explained that I was in a hurry to use it since I've been holding my son who's been asleep the majority of the flight. She said someone was in there. I was aware and asked if I could use it afterwards, the flight attendant seated next to her said "Yes" then the senior flight attendant said to me: Maybe if you ask with less attitude you can go in there. Surprised by her response I tell her I did not give her attitude and that she did not need to speak that way and it is true because I did not yell or curse anyone out and even I supposedly gave you attitude, Aren't you trained to handle this in a proper way maybe by communicating with the customer? No, she stood up aggressively, got in my face and started telling me out loud in front of customers that she will not tolerate me to speak with her that way, that I won't be using the restrooms and to take a seat. Sounds pretty personal at this point! Her reaction was unnecessary and all she did is escalate a little restroom situation to where I started yelling at her and pointing out her disgusting behavior. At this point she kept asking me to take a seat and I couldn't because who will take a seat after being spoken to the way she did? Someone without dignity for sure. At this point there's a lot of back and forth going on between us and she then tells me that I will be considered a threat and she will call authorities if I don't take a seat. She was a threat to me by the way she stood up and got in my face and no one in their right mind will tolerate that. At some point I take a seat after my partner comes to calm the situation, I asked her to call authorities. We finally land, authorities are there, my family and I are the first to get out of the plane. The lady that works for authorities asked for my version which I gave and she said that the FA told them that she asked me to take a seat and wait right after I asked to use the restrooms which is false. If you have the audacity to escalate a situation and be disrespectful at least have the audacity to be truthful too.

### "a lot of shortfalls all over the place"
No in flight entertainment. Inconvenient food ordering system that has to be done in advance. People who had flight delays/changes with kids and planned to get food in the airport were at risk of having no food available because of the limited amount they had for those who didn’t order in advance. My flights were either extremely hot or extremely cold. The first class seating had broken charging ports that had coffee spills on them. Stewardess simply said 3 of the first class chargers are broken (out of 8? ), so the two of us in my row are out of luck. The tray between the two first class seats was just gross. Dirty. The ticket counter was absolute chaos both on the way here and on the way back. Half of the self serve baggage tag printers were out of paper resulting in long lines, and lots of anxious customers. I don’t get it. I wouldn’t normally add a review if I thought my experience was an isolated one but there seems to be a lot of shortfalls all over the place with this airline.

### "Absolutely terrible experience"
Absolutely terrible experience flying with Alaska. First of all, I’m still on the plane, it is extremely hot on here, and has been since we all loaded. There are no TV’s on the back of the seats like most up to date airlines have. The isles are so small you can’t walk to the bathroom because there’s almost always someone else in the isle already. I paid extra to sit behind first class in the premium seats but the perks that I paid extra for are non existent. I hit the assistance button to have a drink brought to me, but the stewardess told me to walk to the back of the plane if I want a drink. Also, the stewardess is extremely rude, she clearly hates her job and is not welcoming. I asked for milk for my daughter and she said they don’t have milk. How do you carry sodas and juice and all the alcohol but not milk?! We’re going to try and switch our flight with another airline for the flight home because Alaska is so ancient and has been such a let down. Do not recommend. Oh and my seat doesn’t recline. I’m in premium seating, it should recline. My husbands chair reclines but mine is broken I guess. Also, we struggled but managed to put our daughters car seat in the airline seat and we got her buckled up and then at take off they decided to tell us she needed to be in the window seat with a car seat -why wouldn’t you tell us that during boarding?

### "the pilot had no sense of urgency"
We were on a connecting flight to London and the pilot had no sense of urgency to give us updates on flight when we sat in the taxi like for an hour. We were 2 minutes late to our American flight and they still wouldn’t let us in either. Cabin crew was great but pilot screwed us and American Airlines screwed us too.

### "employees do not care about customers"
Not Verified |  After 3 weeks of visiting my family in Washington, two of my children were returning to Texas today unaccompanied. My wife's and my names were added to the unaccompanied minor packet, however, the desk agent only added my wife's name into the system, preventing me from being able to get a security pass to meet them at the gate. The ticket agents at DFW airport told us of the error, but made no effort to attempt to find a way to rectify the situation or even show a basic level of human empathy. They said it was the fault of the SeaTac branch and was not their problem. They refused to take any company blame and instead continually tried to push off responsibility and without making any effort to solve a problem. I understand the original problem was created by the SeaTac ticket agent, and they need better training and attention to derail, but the lack of even average customer service at DFW ticket counter really irks me as with just minimal effort on their part, I would at least not be writing poor reviews about Alaskan Airlines. I did file a complaint directly with their company, but after seeing the way they Alaskan's employees represent this airline, I will be looking at taking my business to their competitors in the future. Don’t fly with Alaskan Airlines, their airport employees do not care about their customers.

### "Worst flight experience of my life"
My partner and I were traveling from Seattle back home to San Francisco on 7/16/2023, and I purposefully purchased an earlier flight from Seattle as we were traveling on a Sunday and both of us had work the following morning. Our flight was scheduled to depart at 3:55 PM and was to land at SFO by 6:08 PM. First red flag: Alaska Airlines changed the gate to a completely different part of Seattle's airport last minute. Extremely inconvenient as this was done very close to the alleged boarding time, and Seattle's airport is massive and required several train transfers to reach the new gate. Second red flag: delays without any information. First the flight was delayed from 3:55 PM to 5:02 PM, but no information as to why. Then, the flight was delayed to 6 PM, again no information as to why. Then, 7:40.... 8:10....9:00....9:40....10:00....we finally departed at 10:19 PM (a 6 hour delay) as our airplane was broken and a crew was repairing it for hours. It took over 3 departure time changes for anyone to tell us what was going on, and the Alaskan Airlines representatives were basically unsure as to if we would even be leaving that day as it was "all up in the air". Why was there no back up airplane? Why not take an airplane that was scheduled to depart much later in the day/night, and have that flight then use our airplane that was being repaired? Alaska Airlines thought they could mend things by giving us each $100 flight credit to be used for a future flight (which will go to waste as I will never fly with Alaska Airlines again) as well as $24 meal vouchers per person, which if anyone knows the price of airport food then that's enough for maybe 1 sandwich and a drink. Worst flight experience of my life, never again will I fly with Alaska Airlines or recommend Alaska Airlines to friends/family.

### "cannot say enough good things"
Not Verified | This was my first time flying with Alaska Airlines and I cannot say enough good things. I could not get into the States from Canada to get my flight because I didn't have the ESTA, my kids and husband didn't need one because they are Canadian. We decided they should go ahead and I would wait and fly as soon as I received it. I called Alaska Airlines and they were amazing, no wait to talk to someone, and allowed me to change my flight as needed and only pay the difference. They did not have to do anything to help me really, as my ticket was one of the cheaper options. Once I got the document I needed three days later they got me on the next flight available. Every member of staff I talked with was so polite and professional. The flights went on time and arrived early. I have flown quite a lot in the past and have never been as impressed as I was with Alaska Airlines and I will go out of my way to fly with them again, even though there are usually other options that work better for me flying from Canada. I really don't understand why their rating is not higher.

### "does not like it’s customers"
Rude people on the phone refuse to supply info needed for flight such as gate and if any delays. No agent at ticket counter in Atlanta and phone agents said they couldn’t help. Very rude gate agents. It’s like this airline does not like it’s customers. Use another airline.

### "one of the worst airlines"
Not Verified |  Alaska Airlines in my opinion is one of the worst airlines I have ever flown. I was on a 5 hour flight and they don't provide you with a meal. They barely give you a snack. I couldn't get any streaming or even texting capabilities unless I wanted to purchase it for $8.00. Or if I was a member of team mobile! On each flight, they are lacking in overhead luggage space so they ask anyone wanting to check a bag will get the ability to get on the plane in group C. So much of an advantage. They don't seem to take the time to clean the aircraft in-between flights. They barely give you the included beverage. They have no in-flight movies unless you have your own mobile device which I couldn't use for their 700 free movies because I couldn't get into it without paying for streaming, but I was able to get into their commercial. They don't have enough space overhead, but if you don't bring on your own device, you are sitting there with nothing to do for 5 hours because you can't get it on your phone. In fact being on the plane is like one big commercial. They ask you if you want to open up their credit card and all the wonderful things you will get after you accrue 30,000 miles. Then the final thing, your luggage will be there in 20 minutes or we will give you some air miles. I will not be flying Alaska Airlines and they can keep your air miles and their nickel and dimming and in my opinion elitest practices.

### "dishonest fare tactics"
Just went to book Psp to Sfo. At the end of the long process, Alaska Airlines informed me that my seats were no longer available. They made me start completely over, could not just start me in the seating chart. When I got to seats, my seats were still available. But my fare was about a 3rd more expensive. This is flat dishonest. I used to fly even more often. Alaska used to be the best airline. All of the new nickle and diming and inflexibility and now dishonest fare tactics; management has clearly changed. I will not be choosing Alaska Airlines over more honest airlines again.

### "plenty of legroom in Economy Class"
Due to flight cancellations and inability get a standby flight to YVR on United, I chose to fly to Seattle to get closer to Vancouver. The 737 MAX 9 is a very comfortable aircraft with plenty of legroom in Economy Class. Flight crew as friendly and provided the usual refreshments and snacks. If Alaska Airlines had more flights from DFW I would not hesitate to fly it again.

### " A great job by all"
Not Verified |  Arrived at Dulles and had to declare a firearm in my checked baggage. AA employee Sahira assisted me and she was training at least 8 new employees. She was efficient, pleasant and quick even while training. My bag was unintentionally put on the conveyor before it was X-rayed by TSA. Sahira and the entire group disappeared and retrieved the bag in only 15 minutes and helped us finish our processing through TSA. The entire group of new employees were eager and happy and it was the best airport experience I’ve had in years. A great job by all especially Sahira! She is a credit to Alaska Airlines.

### "They have changed for the worst"
Not Verified |  My wife and I have exclusively used Alaska Airlines for the past 15 years with great satisfaction. On the last trip in June we found they have changed! They no longer provide even adequate service but don’t care for their customers in the least and will lie when they get caught in bad service. I have 150,000 miles and my wife has 124,000 miles Both Elite and MVP customers. But they treated us poorly, didn’t care that we fly first class or anything, I was actually threatened by a gate agent supervisor and her supervisor. Customer Service didn’t care less and just ignored us. They have changed for the worst.

### "delayed arrival of airplane"
An almost 2hr delay with super clear skies because of their own reasons: delayed arrival of airplane and then waiting 50 min in the plain to get a lane to fly.

### "I do not recommend this airline"
This is my second review. When I was finally able to reach an Alaska Airlines representative by phone and explain the situation, I learned that there was no unaccompanied minor status applied to our child when the reservation was made by phone, contrary to what my husband was told by the airline representative at the time of purchase. I was informed when I was making my complaint that unaccompanied minor status was only paid for and applied at time of check in. Why didn’t the phone representative inform my husband when he placed the reservation? I also learned Alaska Airlines is focused on money more than a minor’s safety. I explained that I had been allowed to accompany my child to the gate for the departing flight and the supervisor I was speaking to exclaimed, “And she didn’t charge you!” I would not have expected to be charged just as I did not expect to fill out a form during check-in because we believed we had paid it as part of the rather expensive ticket we already paid. The supervisor criticized me for not searching out this information on the website. We believed everything was taken care of because we had Spoken to Alaska airline representatives, both when we made the reservation and during check-in. Apparently representative’s words cannot be trusted. Because of the lack of competency on the part of Alaska airlines, our minor child was not met by the guardian at the gate upon arrival. The guardian was not allowed to accompany our minor child through security on the return flight, and was not present as guardian and witness when our minor child was searched all around their privates by TSA. Because of Alaska airlines incompetency, I was not allowed to meet my own child at the gate. If I had not directly asked the representative what was required when I was denied a gate pass, I never we would have even heard about the “yellow form “. Alaska Airlines is worse than the Keystone cops and I do not recommend this airline to anyone.

### "Alaska is my airline of choice"
Gate check in was short staffed and not overly helpful. In fairness it was a full flight and they looked busy. Flight Crew was a different story, they were beyond amazing! Thomas, Becca and the other 2 attendants were all so kind, and helpful. There was a medical emergency on the flight and all of them worked together to provide support. I have so much respect for the crew and Alaska is my airline of choice!

### "Zero marks for customer care"
Our luggage is lost. It was supposed to come on next flight and be delivered to us last night or else by 9am this morning. There is still no sign of it and absolutely no communication from the airline. The phone number I was given is not working. They are not responding to my emails. We have a six day holiday in San Diego and the first day is already destroyed. Well done Air Alaska. Also, they were "left short" on restocking so the only refreshment we received on our flight was a 250ml carton of water that tasted vile. A relatively minor complaint but another example of lack of concern or regard for customers. Zero marks for customer care.

### "not impressed at all"
I am not impressed at all with the staff, convenience, or customer service. I booked a cruise and I booked the flights to and from through Air to Sea. I was supposed to be on first class because I am clausty and have a terrible fear of flying. I realized I was not booked correctly. I reached out to Air to Sea and they said no problem, just download the apps and change seats. On my flight there I was booked on American Airlines. I went on the app, easily upgraded to first class, the staff was super helpful, and they even upgraded my entire family for free! The flight was comfy, the staff on the plane were great, and I had zero panic attacks. Not the same experience with Alaska Airlines. They would not help me. They told me we had plenty up upgrades available and it was a small fee to upgrade. Then the staff said never mind we can't help you because you went through Air to Sea. So we called Air to Sea that said they can't help because the airline does not allow them to see first class. After going back and forth we got both sides on the phone at the same time where Alaska Airlines said they would upgrade us for over $1,000 a ticket! Wow. Horrible customer service, very petty because we booked through Air to Sea, treated us terrible like we had done something wrong, not to mention plenty of seating they are refusing to sell us. They should be ashamed and they reminded me of why I will always be loyal to American Airlines!

### "Disappointing first experience2
They damaged a brand new bag I checked in at Kahului and I cannot use the telescopic handle any more. When I pointed this out to their representative Val at Seattle Airport he told me I wasn't entitled to any compensation. After an overnight flight I was too tired to push my case and accepted what he said. But when I arrived at my hotel and emptied the bag to check the mechanism I discovered the mechanism at the bottom of the suitcase bent which has now jammed the handle making it useless. This is obviously from damage from poor handling. Their web site freezes regularly and there is no way to even send them a message to claim compensation or take this matter further. Having flown Hawaiian Airlines to many islands in Hawaii and enjoying the warm and genuine friendly and cheerful staff on Hawaiian it was a stark contrast traveling with Alaska Airlines for the first time. Whereas the flight attendants on Hawaiian greet every passenger when boarding my wife and I noticed that he Flight Attendants on Alsaka were too busy talking to each other when we boarded to even greet us! Service on board was also very indifferent and you got the feeling they were just going through the motions until the aircraft got to its destination. Disappointing first experience and maybe no more!

### "She is truly an asset"
Not Verified |  My 87 year-old mother and myself have done this same trip 3x, And each time we have been serviced by Patricia (from Mahlon Sweet Airport in Eugene). She is the best agent you have. She made sure we had everything we needed -- my mom requires wheelchair assistance, so flying is especially stressful!! She helped us through every check point and even took some pictures as we boarded the plane. She is truly an asset to Horizon Air and Alaska Airlines.

### "Super kind and accommodating"
Not Verified |  Traveling musician headed to Tampa for 3 shows. Have my expensive guitar with me and was offered a place to stow it in the flight attendants closet onboard. Huge shout out to Shelly and Shari on AK flight 326 from Seattle to Tampa on 5/21 9:15am! Super kind and accommodating. I can’t thank you enough.

### "worst airline company ever"
This was the worst airline company ever. Check in staff are not properly trained. The girl that was suppose to be helping me check in doesn’t know hat to do, she keeps on asking the manager for help and her other colleague. Manager and colleague also doesn’t know what she’s doing. She keeps making phone calls then she came back to confirm that yes I as in-fact correct that a lap infant has a free check in luggage allowance. We missed our international due to their lack of knowledge, negligence, and irresponsibility. They refuse to book us with another flight so we don’t have to miss our flight, they didn’t. I told them that we don’t have money to pay for extra since we struggled just to pay for our existing tickets. This is the only time that I felt that if you’re poor, they don’t care, people or company will just step all over you. I was willing for them to fix the problem so that we can still leave to go to Philippines. I even told them that we can sleep at the airport floor and willing to fly the next day. Both EVA air and Alaska air will not do anything about it. We ended up staying at hotel hampton inn and picked the cheapest room possible and kept making phone calls after phone calls because Alaska air said this.

### "big thank you to all at Alaska Airlines"
Not Verified |  I had a delayed flight into Tacoma from London with American Airlines, which mention I missed my connection to Kona with Alaska Airlines. Was told by an American Airlines representative that everything would be sorted, like our flight to Kona the next day and our over night stay in Tacoma. But when I approached someone at the American Airlines desk they wanted nothing to do with it. They said it was an Alaska Airlines problem because it was an Alaska Airlines we had missed. Which I disagree with as it was an American Airlines delayed flight that caused us to miss our connecting flight to Kona. So I then went to Alaska Airlines desk, they couldn't have been more helpful. They booked our flights to Kona the next day, booked a night at the Comfort Inn and gave us food vouchers with no cost to us. I would highly recommend Alaska Airlines to fly with as I still don't think it was there problem to look after us like they did. We had a great fight to Kona the next day, friendly cheerful cabin crew, clean air craft. I hope to fly with you in future and a big thank you to all at Alaska Airlines from Steven and Jacqueline from Scotland.

### "they kept switching gates"
The management is not at all good. Seat assignment is always messed up. They made me wait till the last minute for the seat assignment. Also they kept switching gates which was very confusing

### "my last flight with them"
One of the reasons I fly first class is the first class lounge. I pay (on average) triple the price. I went to the lounge today and was turned back with the excuse that they changed the rules to accommodate their members, that is, unless I pay an additional $30. Apparently, the $30 allows them to bend the new rules. It's not about the members, it's about the money. Just another way they are taking care of their customers. I fly about 8-10 trips per year, all of them with Alaska Airlines. Im pretty stubborn, so I mean it when I say that this is my last flight with them.

### "unorganized, unpleasant, rude"
First time flyer on Alaska Airlines, completely disappointed. Very unorganized, unpleasant, rude. Sad to say my flight on United was 100% better. They seemed to be confused an struggling get us boarded, flight attendants were rude and not helpful or pleasant.

### "great customer assistance by the staff"
Not Verified |  Smooth flight round trip and witnessed a lot of patience and great customer assistance by the staff. One of the 6 American Airlines I will fly with and I have flown on small and 4 seater planes and have followed airline travel for decades since I am a huge travel buff. Safety is number one, then customer service, then cost, then on time departures.

### "airline is one of the worst"
Aircraft was in poor condition. I paid for a premium seat upgrade, and the seat was super narrow and not worth the extra cost. There was no under seat storage for two of the three seats in my row. The overhead bins are miniscule and they ran out of space before half the plane was boarded. The flight attendants were fairly inattentive to their movements and rammed into me multiple times, despite being fully out of the aisle. When beverage service started i spent a solid 5 minutes with the second seat flight attendant's bum repeatedly being shoved in my face. I understand they have a job to do, but the lack of respect for passengers space is abysmal. The airlines need to consider this when designating aisle space. The curtain separating first class is not tied/otherwise secured, and i spent 90% of the flight with it flapping in my face (seat C6). This airline is one of the worst I've had the misfortune to fly with. Every trip has been subpar, but to charge for premium seating and  cram people in like sardines in this row is outrageous. Delta or southwest are far preferable because even when they're awful, they're better than Alaska on a good day. Flights are also super limited with awful flight times for non stops, and ridiculous layovers for multi-stop trips. On board wifi is trash and not worth the $8 they Want out of you. Nothing would load.

### "never fly these people again"
The checking agents, and the TSA screening agent suggested that the flight might be delayed. When I got to the gate, I asked them and I was immediately met by hostility from two women who were manning the counter. They stated that would be no delay, but here we are now, about one hour delayed. Everyone knew in advance, but they failed to disclose it, and I called him out on it and they got extremely hostile towards me. I will never fly these people again.

### "Worst service in the industry"
Not Verified |  I’m waiting on back surgery. Standing and walking is terribly painful. Went up twice to say I have to please have a wheelchair. Not only no chair but I had to stand in line leaning on my cane for 15 minutes just to have extra time. When I got up to the front and noted I never got the wheelchair, the gate agent dumbly said, “there’s one over there.” I pointed out it was unstaffed and I couldn’t push it myself. Got onboard, asked for help putting my little case above me. No, they’re not “allowed” to handle baggage. Man, do I miss Virgin. Worst decision to let Alaska take them over. Worst service in the industry.

### "very disappointed on Alaska Airlines"
Not Verified |  They lost my car seat they don’t want to be responsible to pay for it to get replaced. I had to buy a new car seat for my v vacation during my stay in San Antonio. They gave me a 75 dollar discount for next flight my car seat was 350. They told me to make a police report which I did and they still going around the bush not acting responsible for it. I’m very disappointed on Alaska Airlines, I used to absolutely love them. I was able to flight directly from Seattle to San Antonio but you can’t keep flying with someone who thinks it’s okay to leave your child without a car seat.

### "attendants need some more training"
I am very disappointed in the way I’ve been treated by flight attendants on flight 305 on April 4th 2023. I am not the smallest girl nor am I the largest but I will say I do fit in my seat well but the other two passengers next to me are a little bigger so it doesn’t allow me to sit in my seat all the way and I am pushed to the edge of my seat closest to the isle (my arm is kind of over the armrest where if someone is larger sized walking by they will bump into me). However the flight attendants on this flight seem to be fit and are not overweight at all, which is mind boggling to me because neither one of them walking by that pushed bumped or ran into my arm with the cart are overweight or obese so in my mind there’s no reason why they should be bumping me in the aggressive way they have been this whole flight so far. Neither of them apologized or even acknowledged me when they did bump into me I find it very unprofessional and unpleasant and I don’t plan on flying with Alaska again after this experience. Even someone on the plane twice the size of Gail turned to where she wasn’t bumping into me. And if that doesn’t prove that these terrible flight attendants have no respect or self awareness then I don’t know what does. All of these flight attendants need some more training on being professional and being considerate of others.

### "hour to de ice our plane’s wings"
They took 30 minutes to an hour to de ice our plane’s wings before take-off from Boise. Once we arrived in Seattle, our plane sat there for 20 minutes. We arrived to our next gate 5 minutes late and the doors were closed off. We missed our flight, got no refund for those tickets, and had plans ruined.

### "Absolutely horrid experience"
Not Verified |  Absolutely horrid experience, terrible customer service. Lost Luggage for more than 3 Months. Don't ever waste your money with Alaska Airlines. Alaska Airlines lost our 3 bags on December 22, 2022. It's been 3 Months, and nothing has been done. We filed a claim in person and online, followed up in person, and have spent many hours on the phone every single week for the last 3 months only to be mistreated and to hear that Alaska Airlines don't take responsibility for their acts. My Family and I were left without clothes, lost many valuable Personal items and expensive gifts bought for Family members. We trusted our luggage to Alaska Airlines, paid for Trip Insurance, have the Baggage Claim tickets, and still are getting no help and being treated as we don't matter.

### "Flight attendants are pretty good"
Not Verified | As a first-time flyer, this definitely was a nice introduction to fast travel by airplane. Pros, then cons. Pros 1) Flight boarding time is usually delayed cause airport security or passenger offloading, so if you've arrived with barely an hour to get to the terminal after going through TSA and boarding pass first, you should reasonably make it. 2) Flight attendants are pretty good about making you comfortable 3) Tolerable wait times for taxiing and whatnot. Cons 1) The twin-engine plane (Boeing 737, I believe) economy seating is just enough to be problematic for anyone who has claustrophobia. Additionally, the fold-out for laptops is only big enough for the PC; you want to use a mouse, well, need to use another fold-out on your right. 2) If want additional elbow room, first-class ticket is necessary 3) Lavatories are small enough that anyone significantly fat will feel cramped. I'm skinny, and anyone who's taken care of his/her body should be able to use them without difficulty.

### "We were treated very well"
Not Verified |  My wife an I were coming home from a fantastic vacation, during which I severely injured my left leg. We were treated very well on Alaska Air, but Bethany took exceptionally great care of us. I was unable to remain seated due to my injury and she and the other flight attendants made sure that I was as comfortable as possible for the entire flight.

### "Been on hold for 6 hours"
Not Verified |  Been on hold for 6 hours, booking 7 1200$ tickets and the website continues to have issue after issue. It’s like you have the audacity to want to travel these days. Alaska airlines used to be amazing, and generally once on board the flight attendants are good and all is well but the entire process from buying tickets to check in is ungodly now a days. God forbid luggage gets lost they also act like it’s your fault. If I didn’t live here I wouldn’t be flying with them, but the free bags as residents keeps me going.

### "What a horrible experience"
Never flying this airline again. Late both going to Columbus and the connecting flight returning to Oakland. Going to Columbus we were delayed and sent to another gate, only to return to the same gate we came from an hour later. On the return trip, I had to run with carry on and laptop from gate N to gate D with minutes to spare to make my flight. Also all the passengers on the return flight from CMH to Columbus had to have an additional security check at the gate - a full body pat down - before boarding the flight. What a horrible experience! One I will never repeat.

### "Not a great airline at all"
Terrible attitude from the lady at 11am at gate D6. Plane was uncomfortable and the flight attendants did the bare minimum and could use some classes in being better to people. No entertainment, no snacks. Tiny bathrooms. Not a great airline at all.

### "flight attendants did the bare minimum"
Not Verified |  Terrible attitude from the lady at 11am at gate D6. Plane was uncomfortable and the flight attendants did the bare minimum and could use some classes in being better to people. No entertainment, no snacks. Tiny bathrooms. Not a great airline at all.

### "Terrible and so disappointed"
Flight was delayed, they tried to move our seats even though we paid to sit together. Told the woman at the D6 gate at 11AM and she tells me to calm down and saying “whatever” under her breath. Nastiest woman in the airport. The flight attendants on board are the same way. They treat their customers like garbage and delay flights. Never again will I fly with this company. Worst experience and unprofessional staff . Terrible and so disappointed. There was no reason to treat people who pay money to fly with you like that.

### "last time I will fly with Alaska Airlines"
Not Verified |  Arrived at PDX 2 hours prior to departure, booking in took over 1 hour. The person who booked us in was nice and apologised for the delay, I had an extra case I wished to pay for the confusion and stupidity of the process was ridiculous. When trying to pay the excessive cost my credit card was not accepted so my daughter who was with me and lives in Portland tried to pay with hers neither of hers where excepted. The person try to fix issue spoke to her supervise who was rude and useless. She had the audacity to query whether we had enough money to which my daughter was very insulted. My daughter was then told to go to a machine enter money get a card to pay this also did not work. Then the assistance asked us to wait while she went to more senior person who organised payment with daughters card. Then finally finishing the paper work I was asked was I an Australian citizen even though born here and have and Australian passport. Then I had to quickly say goodbye to my daughter and go to gate. This was my 10th trip to Portland and every time issues when booking in with Alaska another time book assistance took my passport went to back with it which I did not like and was told by customs Australia never to let passport leave my sight. It is the last time I will fly with Alaska Airlines due to this experience. I was told I would receive some compensation for the stuff up or my daughter would as she gave her email address when asked. I will be sending this email to qantas to as part of star alliance with Alaska.

### "6 days and counting to get bag delivered"
Not Verified |  On a direct flight cannot get the bags for the customers on the flight given 2 hours to get it through TSA security. Then, upon getting the bag delivered 12 hours later, takes 6 days and counting, to get a bag delivered to the customer who lives 2 hours away from the destination.

### "never fly Alaska Airlines again"
Worst experience ever, terrible attitude when checking in at JFK even when I am flying first class. The staff made herself a piece of work. Will never fly Alaska Airlines again.

### "so uncomfortable and sad"
Let me start this rant by saying I fly a lot, usually with Delta, but occasionally with AA if they have a quicker route, then transfer to Alaska airline for the last leg of my trip into Nome (Delta doesn’t fly there). I’ve NEVER had any complaints about a flight crew - ever. Instead, I’m the person watching out for the flight crew - completely in awe of the long shifts they work and the kindness they show to each of us. Always grateful for all they do. Like everyone else, often bewildered by the general rudeness of some of the public towards the staff. That was NOT my experience today 1/5/23. Alaska airline flight had a quicker route that sent me through Portland to Anchorage, so I chose it. Because of the amount of miles I fly, I typically get upgraded to first class (even if I don’t purchase). Today, there was no first class seats for purchase, so I ended up sitting in business class, exactly one row behind first class. I was completely fine with that. Again, no complaints. The reason for the rant. I had a horrible experience today. My Alaska airline flight 197 was delayed approx. 1 - 1.5 hours. The flight was originally a late night flight anyway, so this just made things a bit worse, but completely understandable. Things happen. The flight crew can’t control when the plane arrival/departure. However, 3 hours into my delayed flight, while everyone was sound asleep, absolutely no movement at all throughout the plane, complete graveyard silence, I got up to use the restroom and walked to the closest one (literally 5 rows in front of me) in first class. A beautiful blonde flight attendant walked up to me and told me to turn around and go to the restroom in the back. Again, no one was up in the aisles or in line for either restroom. Everyone was asleep. It absolutely floored me - really embarrassed me as the gentleman sitting next to me overheard it and rolled his eyes as I had to turn around. I see people from business class use first class restrooms all the time. I’ve never been offended. I’ve never seen anyone rerouted to the back. Anyway, I went to the back restroom and asked the two flight attendants working the back if there was a policy or some rule that I was unaware of. Minutes later - the two attendants in the back - rushed to the front to ”tell on me”. Then for a absolutely NO reason, they proceeded to make an announcement over the intercom to everyone - instructing non first class people to use the back restroom - mind you - NO one except me was had been or was up moving around. My concern, do they commonly bully people that are not in first class? Do they make a point to try and embarrass customers? The announcement was petty and team bullying. For the first time, I understand why people speak up and confront flight attendants for treating them poorly. I get it. They have you in a position of submission while your traveling. It’s so uncomfortable and sad. I suppose the lesson for me - always fly Delta, but more importantly, be mindful of how people who don’t have the means to fly first class are being treated as they may not be the “rude” passengers I once thought that they were to flight staff.

### "She had the most positive attitude"
A woman named Shawna at Alaska Airlines LAX helped me out and let me tell you, I travel every other week so ALOT and I’ve never met a more kind and helpful employee at an airport before. She had the most positive attitude I’ve ever seen and that’s why I wanted to write this review. I offered her a tip and she denied. Protect this woman at all costs.

### "dropped the ball badly"
Not Verified |  I have flown with this airline multiple times and have never had the issues that I had this week. It was pathetic. Right off the bat they lost my girlfriends luggage. They made good and had it delivered the following day. That's when the cancellation kicked in. So they cancelled my flight out and informed me they were working on a new reservation. That was 3 days ago. I had to work today after Christmas. I have not heard a word from anyone. It was an 8 hour hold time on the phone and there were over 1,000 people waiting in line at SeaTac Airport just for cancellations. I ended up having to book a flight out of Idaho with another airline. What baffles me is there were other airlines flying out of the same airport at the same time. This was not weather issues this was scheduling and staffing. They dropped the ball badly and cost a lot of people a lot of money.

### "worst airline I've ever experienced"
Not Verified | The absolute worst airline I've ever flown with first our flight leaving Cleveland left an hour late for the pilot not showing up, then as we were about to land and go to our connecting flight they cancelled. We then waited 6 hours on Seattle airport to reschedule. My 4 year had to sleep on the cold floor no water or food and drink places open at that hour. A news crews even talked to us after seeing him shivering sleeping on the floor. The airline then rescheduled us for the following night and that flight is now delayed 3 hours and climbing from having no crew. Very unreliable worst airline I've ever experienced. I will never fly or recommend this airline to anyone ever again almost 3,000 people stranded in Seattle solely for this airline due to their own fault on Christmas day!

### "bag didn’t even make it on the flight"
On the original flight from Columbus to Seattle, the women at the front desk dropped my snowboard bag and said “whoops, I hope I didn’t break anything” That was the start of our trip. We get to Seattle to find out the snowboard bag didn’t even make it on the flight. We lost hundreds of dollars not having our equipment for this trip. Our return flight on Christmas Day was canceled due to “mechanical issues” and we were told they couldn’t get us out until the 28th. My husband had to let them know he’s military and has to be back on the 27th in order for them help us. So we rebooked for today (the 26th) with three layovers. We are missing all of our connecting flights because the flight attendant was over an hour late for our first flight out of Seattle. We then had to de-plane because of an electrical issue. We’re currently being told at the podium that there’s nothing they can do for us. This is worse than the time I got trapped in France because a different airline went bankrupt right before my flight. Alaska is worse than Delta, Spirit, United, etc.

### "Flight canceled 4 times in a week"
Not Verified | Terrible customer experience. Flight canceled 4 times in a week. There is little to no support to help figure out how or what to do. 8 hour hold times, inaccurate flight availability information on line, inability to self serve flight changes on line, no response from the text or chat option. They need to have a worst case scenario readiness plan in place asap. My experience was awful and to know so many people were in the same situation as me is just shameful.

### "Wanted to shout out Jackie from Phoenix"
Not Verified |  Flight cancelled due to ice storm in Portland. Chatted with multiple agents to help me get things figured out and was issued a refund. Wanted to shout out Jackie from Phoenix for being a literal angel and being so helpful.

### "clearly not a company that cares about its customers"
Not Verified |  First time ever trying to use them. They canceled my flight, and their online system would not allow me to book a flight for the next day. However, upon researching a NEW ticket I could fly with them for twice the price. This is clearly not a company that cares about its customers or puts the customer first in its flying/booking practices. As a result of their unwillingness to rebook my flight, I was not able to see my family for Christmas.

### "very unpleasant journey"
Not Verified |  It was very unpleasant journey since flight supposed to start at 10.25 which delayed to start 2.09 pm, landed at 5.32 pm instead of 2pm. However airlines did not let out passengers after 6.48pm, still in the flight. It was very stressful journey and our vacation totally collapsed. I would not recommend anyone to Alaska airlines for Hawaii vacation.

### "service challenges in business class"
Not Verified |  I fly this route often on 3 different carriers. On my Alaska flight, I experienced service challenges in business class. No meals available for those who didn't pre-book a meal. Flight was 5 hours and the full evening, so I had no dinner. Instead, charged me for my "snackbox" purchase from the two economy options. When confronted on why I wasn't given a meal / why they didn't have enough, they pointed to another customer and explained that they gave it away to him. Followed up with customer service who did not offer a solution (which is a bit odd when a frequent business class traveler has taken the time to write a complaint).

### "the entire experience was absolutely horrible in every way"
Alaska airlines, we will never fly with you again. All excited to take our daughter who loves flights on her first flight, and the entire experience was absolutely horrible in every way. We let the woman at the gate know it was her first flight and asked if they still got wings and an opportunity to see the cockpit, and the response, "well it's case by case but I'll tell the flight crew". Board the flight, no one knew it was her first flight, so whatever we make our way to our seats. Daughter (who just turned two) is now crying because she couldn't see, ok no problem we didn't promise anything to her. We had purchased her a seat so she could have some space, but she only wanted to be held when the plane took off. Still crying and stewardess who was either having a bad day, or clearly has no kids, tells us she "must be strapped into her own seat". I explained she was crying and would be better for everyone if we could just comfort her, she gives a nasty look and says "nope, strap her in". Wonderful, cue hysterical baby, sorry everyone around us. At this point my child is crying hysterically, borderline throwing up, so we pick her up to comfort her (we were at a stand still on the ground, not even moving or ready for take-off), and here comes stewardess number 2. She clearly sees what's going on and we explain we just need a couple moments to settle her, she looks over at stewardess number 1 who shakes her head, and tells us we have no choice but to strap her in. So I apologize to everyone around us, and my wife and I try to console our hyperventilating daughter who continues to cry inconsolably, till we reach altitude and we are able to rip her out of the seat and settle her. First wave of drinks come out and we are completely disgusted with these woman, and stewardess number one walks over and tosses a set of wings at my wife full of attitude and says "somebody's first flight eh". Laughs like she had enjoyed this whole thing. Total train wreck, daughter throws up all over both of us because she was so upset, and no one cared. Another family in the row across from us with a baby was completely disgusted, these two women were acting the way they were. Oh and just to round out the 5+ hour flight from hell, the extremely over-priced wifi I paid for to play a movie and settle our daughter, would not work. It took barely 1 hour of restarts, paid time outs, credit card time outs, and buffering to get it to barely play movie. The movie timed out twice for now reason and when it finally came back the third time the speaking didn't match the peoples mouths. Tried to open a couple games and those wouldn't work because of the wifi either. Several people around us had the same struggles and some asked for refunds and were just left staring at the seat in front of them. Of the hundreds of thousands of miles I have flown, I have never been so disappointed and let down. Pilots who cant be bothered to greet kids. Flight attendants acting angry and vindictive, while also apparently enjoying acting that way. No monitors on a 5+ hour flight and garbage over-priced wifi instead. I get that expenses are up, but don't lower your standards or service too. Alaska used to be a top two airline for me, but never again. Alaska 1048 from San Diego to Boston.

### "amount of gratitude I felt"
I was on a particularly turbulent red eye flight from Seattle to Fort Lauderdale last tuesday night and I have extreme flight anxiety. I had a panic attack in the bathroom and Victoria one of the first class flight attendants came and held my hand and talked me through the experience, then she sat me in the back row near the flight attendants. The row I was put on was with another flight attendants (I wish I knew her name) boyfriend and he talked to me for three hours while she and other attendants came by to periodically check up on me. They gave me a fuzzy heat pad and water and so much compassion. I can’t even begin to express the amount of gratitude I felt towards these people. I normally fly with my husband or family but circumstances had me take the flight on my own and I really wanted to meet my new born niece. I highly recommend this airline.. I’ve been on plenty of flights with attendants that get by doing the bare minimum.. this was not one of them. I would like to thank them from the bottom of my soul for helping me get through that night and for helping me maintain my faith in humanity.

### "Could not have asked for better service"
Everything about this trip went like clockwork. The fare was only slightly more than coach with a checked bag. We arrived in SFO to be immediately checked in by a counter agent. We had a pet traveling in the cabin with us and there were no issues. It took only a couple of minutes. When we got to PreCheck security line there were only a couple of people ahead of us. After going through security we headed to the Alaska Air Lounge. The lounge was not that crowded, large, and spotless. There were plenty choices of food on offer, including an automatic pancake machine. At the gate, we were promptly boarded and greeted by the agent by our first names. The plane was a typical EM175 and the seats were very comfortable. Left on time and service was great, including the protein plate. We were able to see the larger peaks, such as Shasta, Hood, and Reiner. Landing at Everett was interested with all the Boeing wide bodies waiting to be painted. Deplaning was quick and picked up our bags in a couple of minutes. Could not have asked for better service!

### "rude customer service representative"
Not Verified |  We had a layover in Seattle on November 29th. Once we got there our second flight was canceled after waiting 2 hours for the delayed flight. The customer service line was extremely long. After about an hour in line I finally reached a customer service agent to help me get my flight changed. By that time there were no available seats on any flights that day, but I had been trying to change my flight while in line and I got a confirmation for a 9pm flight. When I stated that to the rep, she said they had double booked the seat that I was assigned to, but that she will get my on the flight since the other person had not checked in yet. She printed my ticket and handed it to me. After that I asked if there would be any compensation as we were supposed to be home by 12pm and now we had to wait until 9pm for potentially another delayed or canceled flight and this has already been hard on my family. The rep provided no help whatsoever and explained not-so-nicely that because this was not Alaska’s fault, they are not responsible for providing compensation. This made me wonder, what would be considered “their fault”, or is this some fine print that they can get out of any compensation. By this time it had stopped snowing for a couple hours and everything was melted. I couldn’t understand why all other flight carriers were taking off and landing just fine, yet Alaska had to cancel our flight completely. I understood the delay in the de-icing. I asked why it is our fault that Alaska doesn’t have this figured out. Even on the Alaska’s website it stated that they had flights prepared for the upcoming weather and that they had it all figured out. The rep started to get frustrated with me and started getting snarky. She stated that “if we give you compensation, we had to give everyone in this line compensation”. To which I replied “you should”. She continued to ramble about this weather is causing delays and I told her to look outside and I said “what weather?” Again in hadn’t been snowing and I was irritated that this was the excuse when everything was melted and it wasn’t snowing. She yelled at me and stated “Give me back your tickets”. So she was threatening to take my tickets away for the only available flight out for the rest of the day?! I was appalled! I stated “no” you cannot take my tickets. She started getting irate and stated she has been working here for 15 years and that she is working overtime and she shouldn’t even be here, that she should be home. I couldn’t believe she was escalating things as a customer service rep of 15 years, when she should be helping me out. I stated I should be home by now too! I really felt like I was calm throughout the whole conversation and yet she continued to escalate the conversation. At the end of the interaction I stated that “You will be losing a customer, not that you care”. And she said extremely snarky “No, I don’t think we will”. I said “Excuse me, you don’t think you will what?” She reiterated, “I don’t think we will be losing a customer”. What type of rude customer service representative did I just encounter? Is it my problem that she is overworked? I felt attacked and vulnerable as she tried to take away my only way of getting my family home. I asked for her name and she would not provide me her last name. As I was leaving she yelled that she would be “notating my account”, again threatening me as much as she could.

### "used to genuinely care about its customers"
Alaska Airlines used to be my go to airline, I have been a loyal customer since 2009. I would fly other airlines only when I had to. Anymore AK air could be compared with Spirit Airline, but more expensive. I never used to worry about delays, cancellations, lost baggage, or rude staff. However, now I can honestly say expect all of those things with every trip. AK air used to genuinely care about its customers, but that is no longer the case.

### "seat upgrades are service charges"
I had a credit in my Alaska Wallet from a flight I had to cancel due to covid. The credit included a payment I made for Premium Economy seats. When I went to apply the credit to a later flight I was shocked to see my cc was charged for the upgrade to Premium. Nowhere on Alaska's website does it say that credits can't be used for seat upgrades. Inquiring with customer service I was told that seat upgrades are "service charges" and are therefore excluded. On our recent flight from Austin-Bergstrom to Seattle I upgraded to Premium Economy, paying with a cc, not a credit, but was informed the day before that the livery had changed from a 737-900 to a 737-700 and there were no Premium seats. We are not short people and had to spend the 4 1/2 flight in very cramped seats on a flight that was booked to capacity. Delta will be our go-to airline from now on.

### "best customer service experience"
Not Verified |  I had the best customer service experience! I dealt with Christine in the Seattle branch and she was expremely helpful, very professional, cheerful and informative. Thank you Christine for having such wonderful customer service skills and cheerful disposition! Totally made my day and makes me feel comfortable having my children fly without me for the first time. You are a wonderful representative for the airline they're lucky to have you!

### "Used to be a great airline"
Not Verified |  Used to be a great airline but they left my husband and an entire plane of people stranded in Juneau, for 2 days, over Thanksgiving. Didn't give him a hotel voucher, won't upgrade seats now that we're traveling back home, nothing. They're "not responsible", and their desk agents suck in terms of customer service. I've had better flights and customer service on Spirit.

### "I used to love this airline"
Not Verified | I purchased a "refundable" ticket for my mother, when she could not make the trip due to health issues I requested a refund. The airline would only refund to the original payment method, even though I no longer have access to that card or bank with that institution. The airline told me it was too bad, and I would just have to work it out with the bank. I used to love this airline but they are nothing but thieves who stole $1000 dollars from me.

### "I will never fly Alaska again"
One day turnaround trip from Seattle to San Jose California to visit my father turning 96 years old. Flight from Seattle to San Jose is cancelled several hours before the flight. I am "conveniently re-routed" for the next day going through Los Angeles that would result in my arriving at 8pm. Forced to go through SF and rebook on my own. Return flight: my noon departure is delayed due to mechanical. First delay showed that flight would leave at 1:45. That changed to 2:45 and then 6pm and then 8:20. Alaska did not cancel the flight even though they knew it would be 8 hours until the part arrived and was installed. I rebooked on my own because Alaska would not cancel the flight. The noon flight ended up leaving at 8:15. In 40 years of flying, this is the worst experience I've ever had with an airline. They do not know what they are doing. Service personnel were confused, rude, and ill informed. Most of us got our information by walking with a pilot who conveyed the part delay. I'm not sure what has caused the disintegration of a functional airline, but I will never fly Alaska again. I'm frankly too scared from this experience to trust getting in the air with them.

### "treated poorly for being a loyal customer"
Not Verified |  We have been Alaska Travel Card members since they began. Our last two trips, all in 2022, have had our flights changed multiple times including loss of our premium seats and reassigned to horrible seats. Both trips we used our companion ticket. The trip to Costa Rica was booked LAX to SJO non-stop but both on the trip down and back have added a stop in Liberia which Alaska used as an excuse to bump us from our premium seats. Our trip back to the States, we checked in showing stop in Liberia and confirmed premium seats and purchased food only to wake up and find they had changed it again showing no stop to Liberia and loss of premium seats from LAX to PDX (giving us a seat with no windows). No food. We are now boarded and informed we are stopping in Liberia even though our boarding pass shows direct to LAX. I don’t know what is going on but they are no longer reliable in terms of booking a flight or picking a seat. Count yourself lucky if you get on a flight. I may be looking into Capital One travel card that allows you to book with any airline and the airline treats you as a full paying customer - not treated poorly for being a loyal customer.

### "Do not count on Alaska Airlines to help"
Do not count on Alaska Airlines to help if you request mobility assistance. In Boston - I requested assistance, they refused to help me to the counter. My luggage was falling, I was tripping. But I got no help! Then I was told I had to put my checked luggage on the platform. I said I needed help I was told "you have to put your luggage up here". So a disabled woman tripping and falling over a cane managed to put up a 50 pound piece of luggage. Only after did the incompetent woman ask if I needed assistance? I had asked for help three times and was told no! So I said - if I'm required and able to lift a 50 pound suitcase by myself, I will get myself down to the gate since Alaska Airlines is useless. On my way from Anchorage to Boston I took Delta - I had to pay/tip every person who touched the wheelchair - and I still had to pick up my own baggage? I got to the gate myself bumbling through TSA, who wondered why I didn't have help. When I said I was with Alaska Airlines, they won't help - the woman said "Ah - yes Alaska Airlines, no, they are not much help" and she proceeded to help me. I arrived at the gate and was immediately pursued by an irate employee asking me loudly my name - and very loudly stating they have to fill out a form for when a customer requests assistance but refuses the wheelchair. I quietly explained the situation, and he continued to chastise me, mimic my words - told him to rip it up. No problems here. He refused. He got louder and more obnoxious. He demanded an explanation - I said, if you're going to make me lift a 50 pound bag by myself, after I kept asking for help - I figure I'll be better off getting myself to the gate. I regret not filing a report on this guy, but I have sympathy because its very difficult to get competent help in Massachusetts or Logan airport. I arrived in Seattle, jumped in their wheelchair and barely made it to the connection. Arrived in Anchorage - there was a rep on the ramp talking on the radio stating he had already requested wheelchairs that were not there. So I didn't bother to hang around. I walked all over the airport and I am in serious pain, I will never depend on Alaska Airlines to help anyone disabled. It works against us and we have to tip everyone so it costs more. Stewards and stewardesses range from incompetent to excellent.

### "Just another corporate bait and switch ripoff"
Not Verified |  Alaska Airlines reduced the value of their mileage program after I had responded to incentives and earned 108,000 miles. I tried to book a rewards flight and Alaska had reduced the value of my accumulated miles so much that I could only get tickets on the worst flights that landed the day after take-off. Just another corporate bait and switch ripoff.

### "cautious about flying them in the future"
Have taken this same flight weekly usually with friendly service. However today was awful. Had pre checked luggage and they would not help me. Wanted me to stand in a 45 minute line to hand them luggage. Claimed the agent that would take pre checked bags didn’t come in till 5 am when this has never been the case. When I asked if an agent could take it instead of saying no the person was extremely rude! Ended up using carrying on luggage but had already paid the $30. Rider be warned. If you are flying on a Tuesday (I usually fly on a Monday) the people working not on Monday are rude, abrasive, and awful. Will be cautious about flying them in the future.

### "not fly Alaska Airlines again"
Not Verified |  The landing from Seattle to Ontario arrived at 8:35 pm resulted in damage to my luggage. The pilots landed so hard that some of the overhead luggage bins popped open falling onto some passengers! When picking up my baggage, the area around both of the suitcase's wheels was broken. I reported the damage to customer service and took photos of the luggage. Customer service gave me an email address for my photos. I was told they would take a couple of months to assess the damage and to wait for them to contact me by email. I have not heard from them. I paid $350 for my London Fog suitcase. I will not fly Alaska Airlines again.

### "overall unpleasant experience"
Awful experience! They made at least 15 people with carry-on bags check them. And they lied they won’t fit when indeed those luggages are compliant. Very barebones service, not a good value for the money. It felt like very poor service and overall unpleasant experience.

### "you get what you pay for"
They put me on 2 different types of jets, I can’t recall the type or pull it up because I purchased my tickets through Priceline. I wound up with Alaska Airlines because the tickets were free, can’t beat free! The experience wasn’t terrible. The first jet was small and I had to walk on the landing pad in order to board and get off. For that particular jet everyone that had carryon with wheels they had to put it in cargo. They did have have beverages and pretzels. The seats for that particular jet were smaller than your average plane seat. It was a little over an hour flight and it wasn’t super uncomfortable, mind you I’m ~190lbs woman. The second jet was much more comfortable, they had beverages=. Looking at their prices, they’re not terrible for what you get, you get what you pay for. If Priceline ever offered Alaska Airlines for free again I wouldn’t hesitate at all.

### "told they don’t supply blankets anymore"
We recently took Alaska Airlines from Newark to San Francisco. I am a 74 year old woman and even though I was wearing a jacket I was cold. I asked the Flight Attendant for a blanket and was told they don’t supply blankets anymore. As we were departing the plane and walking past 1st class I saw that every seat had a blanket on it. We will never fly Alaska Airlines again.

### "could not ask for a better experience"
Not Verified |  So impressed with the way Alaska airlines handled our pets enroute. We flew from Alaska to Dallas related to a relocation so our cats had to fly for their first time for such a long journey across the lower 48. They flew in carriers under the plane scary for us! Alaska airlines called our pets by their names and Places boarding pass stickers on their crates with our names and a row of sticker ticket with their names and our names. One would be removed from the carrier before each take off and handed to me letting us know that they are indeed on our plane. Each time we landed a ground crew member would greet us and tell us they saw our cats personally and they have arrived and doing well they once again called them by name and always with a smile. Every Alaska airlines staff I saw regarding our cats seemed to be so protective of them . I could not ask for a better experience in such a scary situation. Max and Ruby are doing great and loving Texas life! Thank you Alaska airlines.

### "Lousy customer service"
Not Verified |  I flew from San Diego to Newark on 10/14/2022. I am Handicapped. Lousy customer service, all around. Flight delay which can happen from time. Main Cabin seats hardly any leg room. Once the Airplane landed, it took an hour to get the plane to park. And instead of being in Terminal A, we wound up in Terminal B. NO Wi Fi

### "Customer service is not Alaska’s forte"
Arrived early LAX and wanted to fly standby on earlier flight. Alaska charges $50 to do this. Its free on United. I needed to text Alaska for help because gate and terminal was not on my boarding i formation, and after waiting for 6 or 7 minutes for Nikki she didnt give me a chance to text an answer and ended the chat. Customer service is not Alaska’s forte. I recommend Delta or United.

### "Alaska changes your seat without telling you"
Alaska changes your seat without telling you, switches you from an aisle seat to a non aisle seat (over 300lbs here) without notice and without any chance to fix it. When asked they said “yeah it happens” and shrugged. It just happened to me back to back on 2 legs of my flight to San Francisco. They don’t even apologize. During check-in, their seat map is mysteriously “not available”, so you can’t verify your seats. I have no idea why they do that. I probably wouldn’t care if they had respected my aisle seating but they couldn’t even do that. The 3 persons I talked to were patronizing, unapologetic, and tried to insinuate it was on me and then told me that there never was any guarantee about the seat you book (what? Never seen that on any other airline).

### "poorly run airline"
Not Verified | More than an hour late leaving Newark. After arriving at SFO we waited at the tarmac for more than 30 minutes due to another plane at our gate. Uncoordinated and poorly run airline.

### "no concern for their customers"
Not Verified |  My wife and friends and I enjoyed a beautiful week in Washington on the coast. When it came time to return home we wanted to extend our flight by 1 day. I found what I thought was the toll free number for Alaska Air online. After speaking to a gentleman about the price increase I decided to not purchase it. When we went online to check in, 2 tickers were gone. I immediately called the number back and was informed that they had been canceled on our end. After much arguing back and forth I hung up. My wife and friend had no tickets and we were to fly out the next day. I went back to Google and found a different number to a nice lady in Boise. She informed me that we had been scammed. I asked to have it reversed and she stated, "there is nothing I can do. We have this a lot. Scammers cancel the tickets and try to get the refund. I asked why there isn't a verification text or email to confirm the cancelation? Especially if this is something that happens often. She then said we could purchase tickets at a 400% mark up. Having no options, we did just that. Once we got the new tickets we realized they were for our exact original seats. I have a hard time believing that a large company whose job is to service customers and knows that scams such as this doesn't have some protocol for just a situation. I highly recommend finding another flight service. Alaska Airlines I feel has no concern for their customers. Absolute garbage service or protection.

### "I would absolutely never ever fly with this airline again"
What a terrible experience. Truly an awful airline. Every possible delay that could happen, happened. Here is the sequence of events: 1) Flight got delayed by an hour (fine whatever this happens) 2) Initial plane has mechanical issues forcing us to have to be bused 10 minutes away to another aircraft (fine, I understand sometimes it’s just a bad day) 3) We have to stand on the bus for 30 minutes in the Cali heat because the plane we were switched to was actively being worked on when the bus we were in arrived (this is where I start getting peeved) 4) We get on the plane and are notified one of the bathrooms is out of order 5) Fine flight, a little bumpy, whatever. 6) We land in Salt Lake, I think the ordeal is over, here’s where it got so much worse. 7) They inform us they do not have a gate for us to approach to get off the plane and that we are in “limbo”. They say it will be another 20-40 minutes until we can get off the plane (I’m annoyed at this point but recognize it’s almost over I’ll be home soon) 8) This process repeats multiple times. We are told every 20-40 minutes that it will be another “20-40 minutes” and this goes on for approximately 2 hours. During this time, as a consultation they offer us an 8oz middle school milk carton of water? 9) Finally we get a gate, we pull up, everyone starts standing up getting their bags out of overhead and we all start to notice it’s taking a while to open the door (about 15 minutes at this point) and then the announcement comes on that there is “an issue of a large gap between the plane and the hallway thing that connects to the plane” and at this point the plane is turned off, meaning the AC is turned off and we’re forced to sit there for another 25 minutes before finally getting off the plane. I would absolutely never ever fly with this airline again. I would choose any option besides this. Spirit, Frontier, man I’d rather drives just an absolute “flightmare”.

### "the flight attendants were excessively rude"
Not Verified |  I bought round trip tickets with Alaska Airlines. On the way to Honolulu everything was fine, but on the way back the flight attendants were excessively rude. I noticed that the airline itself allows their flight attendants to behave with the passengers as they wish and do whatever they want with the passengers - be rude and then they were given the right to throw passengers off the flight for no legitimate reason. I’ve read after that Alaska Airlines is short on flight attendant and even pilots and that is why they turn a blind eye to their behavior. Do not demand anything or you will kick out from the flight just because you dare to ask something.

### "employee Dereje was extremely helpful"
Not Verified |  Alaska Airlines Disabled Persons Services employee Dereje was extremely helpful in helping me and my family negotiate the Seattle Airport, transporting me safely and effectively from the Arrival Gate to the Taxi Dock. He is personable and empathic.

### "they outright canceled my flight"
Not Verified |  They are canceling flights more than most other airlines right now. They rescheduled mine, from a non stop to a 1 stop, with a lay over so short we wouldn't have been able to make the connection even if they were run perfectly on time (which they never are). So we ended up canceling that flight all together. Gave them another shot, and they outright canceled my flight less than 12 hours before take off, at 9pm. Thankfully I was still up, otherwise I would've been screwed in the morning. Now I have to pay double for a last second flight. I'm done with them. Save yourself the hassle and never book with them.

### "I am never going to fly Alaska again"
I travel for work almost every week. I do make sure I check in at least 20 hrs before my boarding time. In my 6 years of traveling every week, I have never had my seat number changed last minute without my permission. I had seat 12A (a window seat) changed to 32b (the last seat in the center by the toilet). So apparently they gave my seat to some family who wanted to be side by side even thought it was allotted to me. When spoke to the person at the desk, he was extremely rude and told me straight of that my seat was give to them because they wanted to sit together. I am never going to fly Alaska again. Do not recommend it.

### "not enough space for carry on bags"
Expensive. Delayed for 50 mins, and not enough space for carry on bags, so I had to check my bag. Waste more than 1hr 30mins in total. Very bad experience. Won’t choose Alaska Airlines for Seattle anymore.

### "All around disappointment"
Not Verified |  The plane was old and dirty, the premium economy seat that I paid for was just as tiny as all of the other seats, and the staff didn’t say a word to anyone that boarded the plane. All around disappointment.

### "Excellent and professional"
Excellent and professional. We had our children flown to Illinois to visit their sister. They were unaccompanied minor’s. Even though they are 13 and 14 and did not need assistance, we felt better having someone keep an eye on them. From customer service to the ticket agent to the flight attendants, I could not be more pleased. They boarded the plane first with the flight crew and departed the plane last with the flight crew. We were allowed to escort them to their gate and sit with them until they boarded the plane and were in the air. They checked their aunts ID upon arrival and ours when they returned. I felt they were safe and as a parent, I needed to know they were safe. The kids had a blast and the flight attendants said they were well behaved and polite. We even googled their flight number and knew exactly where they were at all times. One if the kids was texting us from 35,000 feet. They had a snack on board and watched movies during their flight. Awesome job Alaskan. We will use this airline again. Thank you for making this parent feel their children were in the best of hands and thank you for looking out for my kids.

### "a frustrating experience"
I had a frustrating experience with Alaska. I got a round trip from San Jose to San Diego with my family and among the free items you can check-in are strollers and car seats. On the first flight we were able to check-in for free our son's car seat and wagon-stroller for free. We even called ahead days in advance to ensure we could take our wagon-stroller with us for free. However on the return flight we had to pay to document and check-in the wagon-stroller. The handling of situation was terrible from Alaska. They argued that wagons are not strollers but failed to show any Alaska documentation of their definition of a strollers as ours has seat belts for the kids and can fold to fit the size of large stroller but has a wagon shape. The personnel argued that double strollers were fine but ours was not (even though our could be smaller). We showed them the model on the internet (which states it is a stroller wagon) and even when you search on google for strollers images of this type show on top along the traditional strollers. They argued that allowing us to check-in our "wagon" for free during our first flight was a mistake. To make matters even worse, the personnel argued that we use the stroller to carry our stuff which is besides the point as you can do that why any stroller. This suggested to me that Alaska didn't care whether this was a stroller or not and made it harder to actually get an understanding of the rules rooted on Alaska's policies, which Alaska was not able to provide. Along this lines (about not really being helpful) and taking their attitude to a different level, one of the personnel we were having the conversation in order to try to "solve" the problem threatened us by saying "do you want to fly today?". Not sure what this person was thinking but that only make this experience worse. In the end a more cool headed personnel came in, acknowledged our frustrations and provided a number we can use to complain. This frustrating and unpleasant experience was a result of the poorly documented, inconsistent policies and communication channels at Alaska, and exacerbated by the even worse customer service from Alaska employees at the San Diego airport. I will avoid using Alaska in the future as it is not worth the stress.

### "Horrible experience"
Horrible experience. Showed up to the airport and was told I could not check-in because they have a cutoff time. They charged me $25 to move me to another flight. After getting through security, I arrived at my gate before the original flight. Despite the flight not being full, they told me they could not allow me to board because as soon as they check for empty seats, they have to close the gate. So I’m on a later flight, missing a doctor appointment and a business meeting. Sitting at my gate and watching my original flight take off. Never again will I book with Alaska Airlines.

### "told the flight is cancelled"
Never again, was supposed to leave at 8:30 PM from Las Vegas to Portland, every 30 mins the flight keeps getting push back. At 1130 PM, I was told the flight is cancelled. I was supposed to be at my school orientation tomorrow morning at 1000. I was told by the people at the gate to call the airline to rebook my ticket for the 700 AM flight the next morning. Spoke to the agent and was told I’m good to go for the 700 AM flight, 30 mins later I got another call they overbooked the flight. Never had this problem with other airline.

### "two very enjoyable flights"
I recently had two very enjoyable flights with Alaska in early July. I had never used Alaska before but after a recommendation from a friend, decided to give them a go. I had just arrived on a 13 hour flight from New Zealand, arriving at LAX and needing an onward flight to SFO. I checked in via a kiosk for the SFO flight and I was lucky enough to be offered a $20 upgrade to First Class which I logically accepted. Everything went seamlessly from check in, right through to priority boarding on the plane which was an Embraer ERJ 175. I was so impressed with the way the First Class team member dealt with a very self obsessed passenger who was demanding a lot of attention in the First Class cabin. At no stage did the team member lose it with this passenger and she remained professional and cordial at all times. I was actually sorry the flight was so short as the service was so good. The flight back on 5th July was on an Airbus A320. Check in was painless but TSA was a nightmare as everyone was flying home after the 4th. We were probably just over an hour late departing. This flight was just as enjoyable, very slick and polished and I have no qualms about using Alaska while flying internally in the US. I should use United my default Star Alliance option, but with this pricing and service I am quite happy to use Alaska in future.

### "became a 10 hour ordeal"
Not Verified |  Horrible. The bathrooms broke, delaying the flight. Then we had to divert and land in a different city because the bathrooms broke again. Everyone missed connections, and a 6 hour flight became a 10 hour ordeal.

### "appreciate the level of customer service"
Not Verified |  Had a flight snafu with Priceline and my original return flight was changed to an earlier time and I missed the email notification. When I showed up at Portland to board what I thought was a 1:55 flight I couldn’t print my boarding pass, and worked with Will at assistance. He was absolutely fantastic and worked with me to get me on a later flight and back home the same day. Really appreciate the level of customer service.

### "no improvement has been seen for months"
This airline can’t get out of its own way. Cancellation s and delayed flights are routine. Unable to plan a trip that depends on any arrival time. They’re very apologetic but no improvement has been seen for months.

### "bait and switch scam"
San Diego to Kansas City via Dallas. Alaska Airlines is operating a bait and switch scam. You book through Alaska and expect to fall under their polices but they share flights with American Airlines. As an active duty military member this makes a big difference for me. Alaska doesn’t charge military for overweight bags but American does. I was forced to pay extra fees to an airline that I DID NOT BOOK WITH! I purposely chose an airline so that I could have an overweight bag. Both airlines point fingers at each other but neither is willing to remedy the problem.

### "I will never fly with Alaska again"
Not Verified |  I will never fly with Alaska again. After being delayed for four hours, my flight was canceled because of a problem with the hydrolic system. That's fine, it happens. However, when I asked to rebook, the agent told me she couldn't get me onto any flights until two days later. This was simply not true. I could show her on my phone five flights to the same destination the next day. I could hear e ery other agent book passengers to the same destination with the same party size the next morning. When I asked her why other agents were able to book passengers, the agent was very rude and rolled her eyes at me. Passengers after me in other lines were able to book flights as well, but the agent told everyone in her line she wasn't able to rebook them. This is the second time in a month Alaska has messed up my travel plans. They have joined Spirit on my "never again" list

### "we're never flying Alaska again, I'm sticking with Southwest"
Alaska Airlines lost 4 customers with how they handled their affairs. My partner's 10 year old son and his friend / guardian were supposed to fly out of PDX, after visiting us for two weeks, on July 13th for a 10 am flight. After they boarded, everyone on the flight got the run around as to why they were delayed and then had to get off the flight and got rebooked for the following day, July 14th for 3pm. For some reason they were told to get off the plane but their luggage somehow made it to Seattle, which was an absolute nightmare because my partners son doesn't live with us, nor his friend, so they didn't have anything as to clothes or toiletries for the next day, except whatever they were wearing. My partner's friend and son waited about 6 hours after the supposed initial take off at the airport due to the delays, with three of those hours getting the run around as to where their luggage is. My partner had to leave work to go pick them up. I get on the phone with Alaska that evening after work to try to find out where their bags are and to get compensation for the whole deal. We told Alaska to not send it back to Portland if they weren't able to get it that night, to just send it to Albuquerque, which they reassured us. They gave us a $50 voucher for each to get underwear, socks, and stuff for the night and told us to call customer care in the morning. I called customer care in the morning and the lady was just God awful, no help what so ever. I asked for a refund on the $60 luggage fee since they didn't get have their luggage and thought that was a fair compensation. We were told Alaska doesn't do refunds and put me back on the phone with baggage. Baggage reassured us that the bags would be in Albuquerque when they landed. Well they landed in Albuquerque to find out that their luggage was sent back to Portland and they will fly it back to deliver it later to their address sometime this week or next week. Seriously? First Alaska delayed their flight until the next day, gave us the run around and we lost work hours, can't give us a straight story on the luggage claim, and when we ask just for the a refund on the $60 luggage fee they so no, we don't do refunds but here's a $50 voucher for a future flight. How about no, we are never flying Alaska Airlines again. I flew Southwest last year and my flight was delayed 4 hours, they gave me a $100 voucher without even asking. Seriously Alaska? You messed up hardcore with the flight being reschedule and losing their luggage and all that was compensated was a $50 voucher with the worst customer service? Yeah, we're never flying Alaska again, I'm sticking with Southwest, they've never done me dirty. I'd give Alaska a zero rating if I could.

### "not allow me to use the restroom"
Not Verified |  My husband and I paid $2,500 for premium seats to fly from Seattle to Ohio. During the flight, I needed to use the restroom badly. We were seated approximately 2 to 3 rows from first class. Therefore, the first class restroom was much closer than the main cabin restrooms. I was willing to use the main cabin restroom, and I had used the main cabin restroom previously. This one time, though, there was an excessive line. I have a bladder issue, unfortunately, and waiting in line to use the restroom would have been difficult as I was in pain. So, I went to try to use the first class restroom. When I attempted to use the first class restroom, I was met with resistance by the stewardesses in that the stewardesses would not allow me to use the restroom. The flight attendant stood in front of me and stated “ the bathroom is in the back.” I explained to both how I have a bladder issue and I am in need to use the bathroom. They both stated I am not in first class and that I need to go use the bathroom in the back. I explained that there is a long time and I was unable to wait due to my pain. She shrugged her shoulders and stated I was not in first class and I cannot use that bathroom. They had no empathy and put arbitrary rules above a passenger’s physical well being.

### "frustrating and stressed situation"
On our way to takeoff plane was brought back to the gate and had us deplane due to some works to be done. it took them several hours so needless to say we missed our connecting flight. Replaced it wirh another plane which also had to be repaired. Their planes or maintenance crew are below par putting us commuters in a frustrating and stressed situation

### "kicked out of the premium seats we had paid for"
Booked a family trip in January. 2 Adults and two Kids. Alaska airlines opted to combine two flights into 1. My family was kicked out of the premium seats we had paid for, and where dispersed throughout the plane. After spending an hour on the phone with the airline, we are all together on our return flight (not in premium) But our outbound flight still has our children separated from us, but in premium. The only help the airline offered is for us to talk with the gate agent and hope that someone is willing to swap. We where never notified of out seats being changed. If I had not been a proactive person, we would not have found out we where dispersed through the plane till we arrived.

### "crew were very lovely and friendly"
I flew from HNL-ANC and from ANC-SEA, both were on B737. First leg was a brand new aircraft however when arriving at HNL airport there was a very long queue as their computers were not working and they didn’t have a separate line for first class which eventually they asked us to go to a desk where an employee helped us with an iPad. This by far was the most chaotic check in I ever encountered. Flight was nice and they served a nice meal however with an over night flight they didn’t even offer a pillow or blanket. 2nd leg was an old B737 however crew were very lovely and friendly which made it a nice flight. Overall a nice airline and I’ll use them again in my future flights in US.

### "never been treated so poorly by flight staff"
Not Verified |  Their slogan is the "caring" airline which is comical as I've never been treated so poorly by flight staff. Was riding with my 3 year old - they refused to give him extra water for his thermos. We didn't have time to get water to bring on the plane ourselves and assumed asking to hydrate a child wouldn't be a hard sell. Also no wings offered or any acknowledgement of his first flight - you expect passengers to groan about a kid on the flight but not so much the staff,  who all seemed to hate their jobs. They offer no in flight entertainment from NYC to CA and snacks were only offered once.

### "Literally the worst"
Literally the worst. I paid $750 extra for first class, what a joke!! The seats reclined two inches. Not on pillow or blanket. No care bag with ear plugs, and sleep mask. I thought Avianca was bad but this is beyond bad. Skyway robbery.

### "getting worse and worse"
Not Verified |  The food was horrible and service too. Boxed water tasted like a box. First class fare was almost 800$ and I should have bought my food at the airport before boarding. Alaska Airlines is getting worse and worse.

### "The crew was very rude"
The crew was very rude and had a huge power complex. When he called me out for not listening and I repeated verbatim what he had said he made me switch seats since I was in an exit row. I thought it was handled very poorly on the crew. I know how to open a mid exit door in case of an emergency and have done prior evacuation tests that mimic the situation. The likelihood of finding a better fit person for his “concern” was slim. I switched seats with no argument but I would expect better by the airline that won “the airline that cares”.

### "episode has left me in a horrible state"
I took a day trip to meet an old friend. At the end of the day I returned to the airport for my return trip home. I was seated in the third row at a window seat. A man sat next to me on the aisle seat. He started out the flight being fairly silent. After about a half hour into the flight he started to talk out loud mostly using foul language and moving his arms around in a very erratic way. What was worse was his was coughing and hacking without a mask or covering his mouth. Now this behavior continued through most of the flight. He would take breaks every once in a while but get right back into it. I didn’t even feel safe to drink my water. This guy was spewing all over the place. Many people in the first class cabin were aware of what he was doing and they were disturbed by him. I felt unsafe. I got up to speak to the flight attendant in the front of the cabin. I told the flight attendant that the man was creating a disturbance and that I wanted some relief – seat change perhaps. The flight attendant did not make eye contact with me and barely paid attention to what I was saying. He did say that the flight was full and there was no place to move me. He offered no solutions, didn’t seem the least bit interested in assisting me with the situation. Most importantly he didn’t show any empathy to me about what was happening in the cabin. I tapped him on his upper arm and said – thank you – in a sarcastic manner. He immediately recoiled and said that I hit him and he has a witness. He pointed to a female flight attendant behind me. I said that I didn’t hit him. I then just quietly went back to my seat. Moments later the male flight attendant comes down the aisle and points to me and says that when we land I need to stay in my seat. While he was there pointing to me several people in the cabin spoke up and said that he was missing the point in trying to deflect the problem to me. The flight attendant proceeds to say that there was nothing he could do because the man was not drinking or on drugs. Also the man had been on an early flight with the same flight crew. They already had experience with this man and thought it was alright to let him get on another flight and sit next to someone. The other passengers in the cabin were telling the flight attendant that they wanted to report the whole issue to customer service. We arrive in Seattle. I sat waiting until they directed me to leave the plane where an Alaska Airline representative and several police were waiting for me. We walked out and at the gate were several of the first class cabin passengers speaking with airline representatives. The group was quite animated and angry. The police directed me to an area where we could talk. I recalled the same story that I’ve written here. The police said they were not going to arrest me. Next up was the Alaska Airlines representative. Who started off his speale with – safety is our first priority and thanked me for being an MVP. Then he went on the say that they would review the situation and perhaps ban me from the airline. Bottom line is that if safety in their number one concern then they really didn’t exhibit any behavior that supports that on flight 156 May 24, 2022. The whole episode has left me in a horrible state.

### "they just lost a paying customer"
Not Verified |  I have been a loyal Alaska customer since 1990, I am about done, their service in a word sucks. Late planes, rebooked when it is not needed, pay $1700 for first class and wind up in coach, it is unbelievable how this airline has gone from the best to one of the worst in a year, they just lost a paying customer.

### "Alaska Airlines impressed me immensely today"
Alaska Airlines impressed me immensely today, specifically their flight attendants. I ended up getting food poisoning before getting onto the flight and began getting very sick on the plane. I simply asked for another bag and she brought me multiple with a stack of napkins with half of them damp. Couldn't have been more happy with the service!

### "Everyone is forced to pay a lot of money and be inconvenienced"
TSA took forever, more than 1.5-2 hours because of poor management. So for me to make it to my domestic flight I would have to get there 3-4 hours before, and 3 hours would be rush. Alaska Airlines does not have any flight to offer me to fly to besides the next day, which my ticket will not get refunded at all and I had to pay a lot of the next flight the day after. They wouldn’t even let me transfer it to store credit despite it not being my fault for not making it to my flights, along with 19 other people who missed it due to poor airline and TSA management for just my flight alone. In total I would guess over 100-200 people missed their flight that day in SEATAC. Everyone is forced to pay a lot of money and be inconvenienced due to their poor management and refund policy.

### "Not worth your frustration"
My company booked a round trip flight from Seattle to Nashville with Alaska Airlines (for business). First and foremost, Alaska Airlines has 2 flights a day to Nashville and out of Nashville. Risky business if you really need to get to Nashville. My morning flight out of Seattle was cancelled. They had no other flights until 5:40pm the next day! Ended up having to switch to Delta and arrived in the middle of the night. I had booked a 9am flight for a reason. To arrive at a reasonable time. Very disappointed with first part of my trip. Return trip. I get to the Nashville airport today to find no one at their kiosk. I have a bag to check. Then discover no one mans the kiosk except at 6am and 2:30pm. I’m sitting here on a hard metal chair while my business associates are probably in a restaurant or bar relaxing. I have 2 more flights booked in June and July to Nashville. I am asking to be moved to another airline. They need to give up on Nashville BNA -Seattle SEA if they can’t support the route. Save us the misery. The people sitting around waiting with me feel the same. I’m from Seattle but will check Alaska Airlines off my list for future travel. I’m also attaching a picture of the inside of the plane above me. Filthy and definitely not sanitized. Some cleaning solution and a magic eraser seem so simple. Also, calling or online chat is a waste of energy. Customer service number posted had an estimated wait time of 10 HOURS and online chat 43 minutes. Not worth your frustration.

### "doesn't care about the customer"
Not Verified |  We were returning home from Portland. We waited at the front of the First Class check in line for 15 minutes or so while two agents behind the counter were doing nothing that we could identify. When one of the agents finally called us up, she told us that we couldn't fly because it was 40 minutes before the scheduled departure and there is a 45 minute cut off. Therefore, we had to book a hotel, miss a critical 8AM Monday meeting and leave the next day at 2:00 PM. Clearly, Alaska doesn't care about the customer or customer service. Only rated it a 1 because they would not accept a 0.

### "the worst is their customer service"
They cancel flights without informing passengers. Rebooking a new flight several days later without asking for any preference nor refunding the accommodation expenditure in the meantime. But the worst is their customer service. On social media, they take hours to reply and they just tell you to call their phone line. On their webchat, they tell you the wait time is 1h but it never updates, even after 12h of waiting. Their phone line has over 10h of wait time. Who can stay 10h on the phone? this is useless Never book with Alaska!

### "I’m sick and tired of flying this airline"
I’m sick and tired of flying this airline. Their staff at the ticket counter are impatient, unkind, and extremely rude. They always have a way of ruining my day even if it started out good. They’re also great at having delays, canceling flights, and overall confusion.

### "weren’t even trying to be helpful"
I had one of the worst day and experience because of Alaska airlines. I hold Canadian permanent residence card, I have travelled with it several times internationally, no issues. When I tried to get my ticket printed from Alaska airlines desk in Atlanta they were not able to print it due to travel document issues besides me providing all the documents, they dint even know what this issue in their system was that was prevent them from printing my ticket, the front desk ppl called some helpline which was totally not helpful, they were all just stalling and killing the time figuring out what was wrong and I had to eventually miss the flight because of their fault. I requested to print the ticket at least till one of the connecting airport I had (Seattle) they were not able to do that either, totally not helpful and they weren’t even trying to be helpful is what I felt. I had to be back to Canada the next day for urgent personal reasons and airlines help desk was totally waste in time of needs. I was said I’ll be given a partial refund, I dint get any confirmation for that, and how will a partial refund ever cover for all the last minute flight bookings I had to do to reach my destination? I had to spend around 1500$ extra to get back home because of Alaska Airlines system’s incompetency, I walked to delta airlines and they were able to book and print a ticket to get to Canada with my permanent residence card, they dint have any issue. So alaska airline guys were at fault and I had to bear the consequences.

### "the worst airline I have used"
Not Verified |  Horrible experience. Flight got canceled 2x and needed to stay an extra day. Alaska just went and rebooked on another flight. One of the flights was 2 days after. They never communicated to us about being reimbursed for hotels and meals. Also found out by accident that they will also rebook you on another airline. Staff at Seattle bag checkin was rude and no help. I travel about 6 to 10 times a year. By far this is the worst airline I have used.

### "cancel the flight due to flight crew shortage"
Not Verified |  Sat on the plane for two hours before they decided to cancel the flight due to flight crew shortage. Instead of paying a crew member enough to complete the fight, they cancelled a flight with 200+ passengers. Checked other airlines, only airline to cancel flights that day.

### "botched the trip at every turn"
Alaska Airlines botched the trip at every turn. After boarding, we were first told that we would be delayed for a short time. 45 minutes later, we were told we would soon be deplaning for an unknown amount of time for an unknown reason. There was no mention of when the flight would be rescheduled to or what next steps would be made. Additionally, when I attempted to contact AA help through the website phone number, I was notified that it would be a 2 hour wait before a representative would be available. I have had good experiences with Alaska in the past, but these experiences suggest that AA quality has been just as much a victim of corporate profiteering as many other airlines. I would avoid them for future travel.

### "The worst airline I have flown with"
Ridiculous delays and on top of that after we landed we stayed in the plane for an hour waiting to get a gate because Alaska Airlines is too cheap or too disorganized. No screens on board to watch anything but they promise in flight wifi that never works or works for a few people. The worst airline I have flown with.

### "has drastically gone downhill"
I'd like to know why the 2 tickets I bought on Mar 26, 2022, - Flight 746 Departing Seattle (SEA) Saturday, April 30, 07:15 am was all of sudden today, Tuesday, April 19, 2022, @ 2:05 PM changed to an overnight flight, Flight 260 Departing Seattle (SEA) at @11:05pm on Flight 260? Today 04/19 @8PM you are selling seats on my original flight for over $1700. I've tried reaching you via Phone, which no one answers, and it eventually just hangs up after a few hours of on-hold music, and Chat, which indicates 45 minutes wait, 2 hours later. You are disrupting everyone here and at my destination. I have plans, I keep them, and if I pay for a service, I expect to receive it as purchased. After the last three (3) years of overbooking, cancellations, etc. it is obvious your service has drastically gone downhill. You're not here for good customer service or your Customers.

### "they cancelled my flight back home!"
Not Verified |  I had a flight scheduled from Seattle, WA to Atlanta, Georgia for an important Business trip for 5 days, and i just get a notification that my flight was changed. I look on their website and they cancelled my flight back home! Keep in mind, I booked this flight 1-2 months ago, so I've been prepared. So if i didn't check the change, i would have been stuck in Atlanta! I've been on the phone for about half an hour and the person has been Zero help. My flight to Georgia was on Tuesday, and  I would have flown back home on Saturday, so when i talked to the lady she was going to have me fly back on Sunday, which wouldn't have worked because i have to go to another conference the following week, and we leave on Sunday to go to the other trip. They have no more flights on Saturday, only Sunday and Monday which cant work because I'm on the other trip. So I'm having her cancel all my flights with them, and the rental car, and I'm booking with a different airline because Alaska is no help. I would not recommend.

### "no sense of urgency"
Not Verified | Vancouver to Ontario via Seattle. This airline has no sense of urgency whatsoever. Caught 4 flights total round trip, and not one was in time. They just make excuses to stall till they finally cancel. If you need to get to your destination in time, I definitely don’t recommend this airline. And with each delay, you’ll be walking to a different gate like a mad man.

### "recommend flying with a different airline"
Horrible service. Got a message saying my flight had changes about 45 mins before I got to airport, go to check in and they told me my flight was canceled. I had to be back in Victoria by noon which would of gave me a few hours to spare if flight was on time. They said they could get me on the next flight to Seattle at 7pm, then I would have to figure out from there how to get back to Victoria, BC. Basically said they would leave me stranded and had to figure out how to get back to my own country. If there was any respect they would of had it figured out, but they don’t care about there customers. Would recommend flying with a different airline

### "Worst experience ever"
Not Verified | Seattle to Sacramento via San Diego. Worst experience ever. Started with a booked non-stop flight to San Diego from Seattle last-minute change to a stop in Sacramento with a 3 hour layover. Changed gates 3 different times. Supposed to board at 1108 but didn't board till almost 1230. Then had to exit the aircraft for some problem. Sat for an hour before boarding another flight. Finally left at 2pm. Hope I make my connecting flight.

### "Horrible customer service"
Horrible customer service. Flight was cancelled in the middle of the night. They automatically booked us on a flight to Portland, OR and said that’s the best we could do. Is LA close to Portland? Absolutely not. Then proceeded to call Alaska Airlines in the middle of the night for an hour, eventually a representative confirmed a new flight and sent us the receipt and confirmation. Next morning when we tried to check in, they told us it was never confirmed. She legitimately lied to us and I had to call again to get a flight. Was on the phone for 2 hours and was out on an awful connecting flight landing 12 hours later than originally booked. A whole day of vacation was missed plus countless expenses. This is absolutely the worst airline ever and it isn’t even advertised as a discount airline. Company will be out of business soon.

### "airline is terrible"
Not Verified | Las Vegas to Portland. This airline is terrible. The weather was horrible in Portland. Snow in April which is not normal. We landed at 927am. We have had to wait on the runway for 2 hours. 45 min in to waiting on the runway we were 2nd inline. By 115 hours we were 3rd. This is garbage. Also one of their flight attendants was rude.

### "Single handedly the worst airline"
Single handedly the worst airline I have ever "flown". I put it in quotes because this airline cancelled my flight but never communicated a single thing with me. The only thing I've ever received from them is the confirmation after booking. When I came to their booth to ask about the flight, the staff shouted at me and kept passing me around to different booths and each other. Incompetent, unprofessional, rude, job-hating bunch. Turned out they put me on a United flight. Well thanks to the great service and wasted time being passed around like a ball for help with my trivial matters, I missed that flight. Hey but don't you have to see the bright side in everything? Well, at least Alaska really makes me appreciate United airlines.

### "Will never fly Alaska again!"
Absolutely the worst. Flights to LA from DCA and flight back. Both planes were extremely old with parts and pieces falling off or glued on. Our seat was row 6 which is supposedly “premium!” Nothing premium about it. Slightly more leg room but far less hip room than a regular seat. Two bathrooms on the plane and the flight attendants were forcing 150+ people to use the one in the back so that the 20 people in rows 1-5 can use the one in the front!? Lousy snack and cabin service. The flight attendant refused to even serve water when we asked for water for my kids! Overall Alaska has taken the Virgin brand and destroyed it. Virgin America used to have the best domestic planes. Alaska’s 737 planes should be in a junkyard! Will never fly Alaska again!

### "has given up on its customers"
Alaska Airlines has given up on its customers. They do not communicate with their sister airlines (like American Airlines). One of my Alaskan Airline flights was canceled, they put me on an American Airlines flight from Austin, Tx to my final destination. This was fine until when I flew into my destination and my bag had not arrived with me. I went to American Airline’s customer service booth and they told me Alaska airlines had not even put my luggage on their flight from Seattle to Austin. My bag was half way across the continent and American Airlines told me there was little they could do, because I booked with Alaskan. This is just one instance of Alaska Airlines failing their customers. The Alaska Airlines customer service booth is always closed, no matter what state/airport I fly into. They have turned into an awful company, why is it so hard to communicate between the two sister companies? If you cannot communicate, do no book people to fly with another airlines. They do not care if they lose your bag, they did not offer any compensations, they really could not care less.

### "don’t enforce the federal mandate for masking"
Not Verified |  Flight attendants don’t enforce the federal mandate for masking. Announcement described full mouth and nose covering. Yet the couple next to me didn’t cover their noses and mostly had their masks below their mouths. During de boarding their masks weren’t even on their faces, packed away. Not a single flight attendant said a thing nor the entire crew as they said goodbye at the door. It’s one thing to provide bad service or inconvenience by rescheduling without consent, which Alaska is also guilty of but this is a matter of safety.

### "unprofessional and unsympathetic"
I didn’t get any emails or messages about my flight being canceled just a text message about a different flight. I get to the airport and they tell me I wouldn’t be arriving home until the next day at 12am. Mind you I’ve been at the airport since 4 to catch a 7am flight. Make a long story short, I had to book through Delta paying $1,600 for a last minute ticket and I paid them $991 for the original ticket. So unprofessional and unsympathetic. This is my fault because I should’ve known better - not one of my flights been successful with this airlines.

### "Alaskan Airline does not care about its passengers"
The flight home from Vegas to Seattle and the “customer service” that followed is when it all went to hell. We arrived for our flight nearly 3 hours early. I hate to be late. Our flight was at 11.35 Sunday morning. We arrived at 7.10 am. We grabbed breakfast and everything seemed in order. The flight before ours to Portland left 15 minutes early with no warning and stranded about five people. Our plane to Seattle pulled in and things seemed in order: they loaded the first class and then they made an announcement about the door of the plane not staying open. So there was a delay. But then we noticed them offload the first class, then we noticed them unload our luggage from the plane, they made an announcement that the delay would be an hour, in an hour they delayed it another hour, then another hour, after that they finally announced the cancellation of our flight altogether. It was 5pm at that time. The desk agents were yelling at the passengers over the intercom to stop yelling at them, which I understand but they were not helpful at all. That seems to be the standard with Alaskan Airlines. We made several calls to a customer service only to be transferred so many time until someone pretended not to hear us and hung up on us. They gave us vouchers for taxi to/from the airport to the lodging they set up for us. Firstly, they sent us to the Travelodge in Vegas. Even the taxi driver didn’t want to pull into the parking lot. It was such an unsafe environment (that’s putting it kindly). The desk agent at the motel was so rude. We were exhausted at that point and weren’t even mean to her at all. But she basically threw the room key at us. We went to our room where I slept sitting upright in a chair in front of the door after piling all the luggage in front of the door because door wouldn’t close right. You could see the parking lot through a large gap between the door handle/lock base and the door itself. The door didn’t even lock correctly. There were insects in the tub and running along walls. I cried so hard because I felt so abused by this airline. We paid so much money for our tickets. I will never again fly with them. I am currently on hold with their customer service (right as I write this review) just so I can tell them not to send people to that motel. I have been on hold with them for four hours. Alaskan Airline does not care about its passengers. They’ll take your money and treat you like garbage. Shame on them. Seriously, the worst  experience I have ever had. I’m thankful I made it home. They did stick us in the very last row of the plane where I threw up from all the turbulence. They didn’t even give me a bag to throw up in. Thankfully, I had one in my purse. Truly my worst airline experience.

### "full fare paying customer lower than an upgrade"
I buy a seat in First Class, 2F, on Alaska Airlines for my wife to travel back and forth between Seattle and Phoenix so she can escort her 90 year grandmother. When she goes to board the plane they moved her from row 2 to row 20 in coach. Why? Because a seat in row 1 broke. What you say, that was not her seat, your right. They moved the person from row 1 to row 2 and moved my wife to row 20. Her reservation was not an upgrade from my MVP Gold 75K account, it was a full fare cash purchase. Apparently, per the gate agent, they rank first class customers and she was the lowest ranked customer so she gets coach. Really, there was no one in the other 15 first class seats that was an upgrade. No one purchased a seat after hers was purchased nearly eight weeks ago. You are going to tell me there was no last minute seat purchases or 48 hour upgrades. Ranking a full fare paying customer lower than an upgrade? Over the years the treatment from Alaska Airlines has deteriorated more and more. My mileage account is over 20 years old, Gold or higher for five years, over a millions miles in our combined accounts. I remember what a treat it was to fly Alaska versus United or American, that does not seem to be the case anymore. All my friends tell me I should move over to Delta now that they have made Seattle a hub, maybe they’re right. Might be time to try Delta for the next few years! What does Alaska Airlines say, sorry.

### "a great flight with Alaska"
Alaska's new lounge in SFO was great. Boarding commenced early and I flew on one of Alaska's beautiful "more to love" special livery A321s. Seat was very comfortable and A321 Neo is a great aircraft to travel : less engine noise, better cabin pressure etc. Our purser Becky was one of the best I've met in the skies: passionate and always attentive and always remembering the need of her guests. Wifi was a bit expensive, but worth the price, with streaming videos possible at 38000 feet. IFE was delivered through the onboard network and free messaging was available, which many passengers took the advantage of. Overall a great flight with Alaska.

### "purser in charge was super attentive"
I flew from New York to San Francisco to conclude my spring break trip. Terminal 7 at JFK should be demolished: outdated, and unpleasant. No expedited security lines were available for first class passengers. The lounge was nice, staff was attentive and it was a welcoming environment. Our flight started boarding early and it was a nice new 737 Max 9 flying us across the country for the 6 hour flight. The captain was informative, letting the passengers know that they had problem get the wifi working and apologized several times for it, which the purser did as well, later on in the flight. Flight deck crew also informed us estimated take off time when we were in line, and every time there were turbulences they would make a quick announcement asking the passengers to wear their seat belts. The purser in charge was also the first class dedicated FA and he was super attentive, went by numerous times to check on us to see if there were any requests, and even gave me his stash when we were short on sanitizing wipes onboard. Food was perfect onboard, especially the dessert, and the flight concluded with a 30 minute early arrival at SFO.

### "they were super unfriendly"
My Alaska Airlines flight was cancelled due to a pilot strike and the notifying email I received the night before framed the whole thing as a ‘change in my itinerary’ and that they would ‘help me by providing me with a new flight 24 hours later’. I went to the airport anyway, in hopes I would be able to get on an earlier flight, but they were super unfriendly and declined me any help, despite tickets still being available for the earlier flights. Alaska Airlines is purely profit driven and does not care for its consumers, nor workers apparently. This whole ordeal cost me more than $1000, because all my plans and hotels that day fell through, and they did not compensate in any way. I could not recommend this airline less.

### "Alaska has not been proactive"
Lost bags cancelled flights, delayed departures and now a strike. As demand has increased Alaska has not been proactive. Pay your pilots, hire more staff and remember your customers have other options. Gold member for 20 years and I'm now moving to Delta. Their skymile program is every bit as good and service is currently superior.

### "Worst cancelation policy"
Not Verified |  Worst cancelation policy ever. My flights is in 5 months, I booked it less than 48 hours ago and found out the flight time needed to be changed. With Alaska this is not possible. No customer support, hold time states 4-5 hours to talk with someone. Fighting the change on my CC since i have no other way to resolve. I would have gladly changed to the earlier flight but instead have to go through this nonsense. I will never again give them business

### "I will never fly Alaska again"
This morning my parked car was hit and we ended up missing our flight from LAX to SFO. I called Alaska to notify them we would probably miss our flight and couldn’t get through to an actual human. We arrived at the airport to speak with the front desk and they couldn’t find our original reservation, it took the woman 40 minutes to figure out our original flight details. Then the woman made a call and informed us she couldn’t put us on the next flight or any flight. That we had to book a new reservation. I originally paid $107 for a round trip flight and she wanted me to pay $240 for a one way ticket from LA to SF. $240 per person for a one way flight to travel 380 miles. We didn’t have the money for that. I will never fly Alaska again.

### "The worst experience ever"
The worst experience ever. Our direct flight had been cancelled and alternative flight was booked with over night stay, had to call customer service to get a better flight, didn’t have any suitable options. The best one was to fly from San Francisco and have a change in Seattle to go to Las Vegas. At Seattle had to wait for 30min for one of the crew members as she was running late, unacceptable! Ruined our first day plans in Las Vegas.

### "I'm really grateful to them"
I see a lot of bad reviews but I can say that I made it about 10 minutes after boarding, and the staff was nice enough to print my boarding pass at the gate instead of giving me a run around so I could make it onto my flight! They understood I'm human and in a rush so I'm really grateful to them. They dimmed the lights since it was early morning and the attendants made sure to keep their volume down and came by to collect trash twice. I saw nothing wrong with Alaska Airlines.

### "seats most uncomfortable"
Not Verified | Anchorage to Seattle. Our last flights to and from Anchorage were horrible. I have never flown Alaska Airlines and never will again. The staff was rude, the seats were the smallest and most uncomfortable ever. We travel often and this is by far the worst airline I have ever been on.

### "Don’t waste your time"
Alaska Airlines is bottom tier for flying. I have been flying back and forth from TPA/SFO frequently the last two years and this company just takes the cake for the worst! I paid extra for a direct flight for it to be changed to the most inconvenient times to cater to their needs with no concern or condolence to myself and my family. When you pay extra for a direct you would expect it to be direct not a 10 hour flight stopping at Seattle to then go to SFO. We now come in a day late and leave a day late leading to me missing work and they simply “couldn’t do anything for me”. This company is strictly about the money and doesn’t care if you’re satisfied, I’m writing this review for others. Don’t waste your time.

### "dissatisfied with the treatment by them"
This is the most disappointing flight I have ever flown. I’ve always thought Alaska was decent with customer service but not after this flight. I was asked twice to put my mask on and both times I was greeted by utter anger and disgust. I’ve complied both times because I understand the rules. The problem wasn’t that I had to comply. The problem was that the way they go about accomplishing this is not even remotely nice or courteous in the slightest. For this reason I’m writing this review and I have to say not all flight attendants on the flight were bad or behaved wrongly. Just the two that were looking for someone to argue with. I’m not even a contentious person by nature! Very dissatisfied with the treatment by them to others on the plane as well.

### "massively disappointing the past year"
Alaska has been massively disappointing the past year, I have been re-routed, lost baggage and once even had to exchange seats with a woman so I could sit with my 10 year old child. I run my business through their credit card and even as an "elite MVP" I still get horrible service. I would suggest Delta if you are a frequent flyer. I have never had issues with this airline and they have great customer service.

### "Worst service delay"
Worst service delay due to technical reasons. Wait for 12 hours with a 3 years old. Autistic. Baggage get lost. Going back and for to airport. And I don’t find any help. 2 days waiting for my luggage. And no answers.

### "This flight never happened"
Not Verified |  This flight never happened. I was on my way to Alaska from phoenix for a funeral. After being texted about a delay which would make me miss my connecting flight to Anchorage form Seattle, I called customer service. they found a flight that left at 7:54 pm (current time 6pm) I was still at work but was able to get off work early to make this flight. Customer service mistakenly told me terminal 4 when it was actually terminal 3. by the time I found my way to the check in area I was 9 minutes late to check in. Mind you the flight still had over 40 minutes before it took off, they refused to do anything to help me. After refunding my, only the airline miles part of my ticket they said they could have re booked me if I hadn't gotten a refund. Mind you they said there were no flights and nothing they could do before I asked for the refund. I got home and checked every other airline and there was nothing available of course. This morning I called customer service to make sure they refunded the cash portion of my trip and they hadn't. I finally got all but the travel insurance refunded. I wouldn't recommend  trusting Alaska airlines with anything important.

### "Horrible horrible service"
I purchased a ticket last year then had to stay home due to a death. I was only given the option of a wallet refund and did not read the fine print. My $900 has expired and these were cash funds. This is horrible and in my mind theft. If it was some sort of credit I’d understand but this was cash. I then sat on hold for 2 hours with no answer. Horrible horrible service.

### "couldn’t believe how slow the line was"
Not Verified |  Back in September 2021, my wife and I bought a round trip flight to Seattle, WA from Atlanta, GA with our 1 year-old son for Christmas with my family. Our flight details got changed a few times, but it wasn’t a big deal. Our experience at the Atlanta airport was smooth and virtually frustration-free. After we boarded our plane for Seattle, we had to wait about an hour to take off, but it wasn’t a big deal. Our stay in Washington was great, but it was record-cold and we had 10 inches of snow come down. The night before our flight, we tried to change our tickets because we knew we wouldn’t be able to make it to the airport with the snow and black ice. We tried changing them online, but it wouldn’t let us confirm our change of flight. We had Saver tickets, so normally Alaska doesn’t allow those with Saver tickets to change their flights, but they had a flexible travel policy established for the holiday season. Apparently that doesn’t apply to Saver tickets? It was incredibly frustrating. We stayed up nearly all night trying to get a hold of a customer service agent to talk about our situation, but after being on hold for two hours the line automatically hung up on us. So we canceled the flight. What else were we supposed to do? We were given refunds, so we used the money towards tickets a week from our initial return date, but the tickets were twice the price as the originals. Turns out that Alaska canceled our flight only a few hours after we had canceled our tickets. We figured we could call Alaska after the holiday season and get a refund for the extra charge, considering the extenuating circumstances. Anyway, we scheduled our flight for the morning so that it wouldn’t interfere with our 1 year-old son’s bedtime. The day of the flight comes and our morning flight for 9:15am is canceled and we get stuck on a 3:35pm flight. With a 5 hour flight, and a 3 hour time difference, that would put us in Atlanta at 11:15pm or so. This was incredibly frustrating. We got to the airport about 2 hours before our flight was supposed to leave and went to go get our bags checked. We had checked them online, like the email told us to do, so we figured we could print our bag tags from one of the kiosks and be on our merry way. However, it turns out that if you check your bags from home, you can’t use the kiosks to print your tags and you must wait in line to see an agent who can help you check them. We only figured this out after 30 minutes of trying to print our tags at different kiosks and decided to flag down an agent who told us we had to wait in line. Which line? Well, they never told us, so that was fun to figure out. (Side note: Seattle airport is the hub for Alaska Airlines. You would think that it would be a smooth check-in process). We had to wait an hour in that line to get our bags checked. We figure at this point, we’re going to miss our flight because there’s no way we’re going to make it through security in 30 minutes. We couldn’t believe how slow the line was. It took each agent an unholy amount of time to check bags for a single person. It was ludicrous. Fortunately, they did let us skip a big portion of the security line because we had a baby and a stroller. We rush through security and get stopped because of the baby butt paste we had in our son’s diaper bag. Weirdly, this was the most pleasant part of the airport experience.

### "would not stand behind their sales"
In January, 2022, I booked a flight on Alaska Airlines site, then booked a hotel on Alaska Airlines site. Alaska Airlines later cancelled the flight at the last minute resulting in me not being able to get to the hotel of my destination, I had to pay another hotel fee in a city I was re-routed to and Alaska would not refund me the missing hotel night because of their cancellation, citing it was the hotel policy. I found that to be unacceptably deceiving and dishonest. I did not have any interaction with the hotel, my transaction was with Alaska Airlines  I did not cancel Alaska nor the hotel, Alaska Airlines took both money from me then failed me on both fronts, yet it did not take any responsibility for the consequences, let me take the missing hotel financial loss, in addition to the total disruption of my schedule. The lesson learned is that Alaska Airlines would not stand behind their sales.

### "too late and the doors were closed"
No gate info posted online or at airport (checked every 30 min all afternoon). Got through security with 1.5 hours to spare. No gate listed on displays. Continue checking phone and signs every 30 minutes. When it was only 30 minutes left until gate closing, I started checking every 10 minutes on my phone. With 10 minutes left, it finally showed the correct gate. I went directly to the gate which was less than 100 feet away from where I was. They said it was too late and the doors were closed, despite there being 10 minutes left until gate closing on boardIng pass. Extremely combative and rude: I had three agents arguing with me, one of them mocking me by speaking into a microphone and asking if I could hear it, and saying it was my fault for not going up to the gate and asking (when there was no gate given). Another told me it was impossible to seat me and the plane had already left, which was a clear lie (10 min before gate closed). A third said, “You just showed a screenshot of your boarding pass, do you have the app? ?” as if I were a liar and had faked my boarding pass. There were additional insane arguments, but I’ll spare you. I believe they gave my seat away because they had asked for volunteers to give up seats in a previous email, which I did NOT agree to. Took no responsibility for the lack of gate information. No matter what the prices look like, it’s not worth dealing with these horrible people.

### "getting treated like garbage"
I was flying to make final arrangements for my mother's funeral. When my first flight landed it was on time but they would not allow us off the plane for over a half hour which caused me to miss my connecting flight. When I tried to get them to get me on a new flight the lady in Seattle told me she couldn't get me to Tampa until after my mothers funeral. I told her the circle and she got an attitude with me, rolled her eyes and said she didn't have any other flights. At that point luckily someone with an ounce of compassion came along and got me a flight getting me to Tampa 7 hours late (at 11:40pm) They switched me to United and said they'd have my bags switched too. Well when I arrive to Tampa no bags. I went to their office and it was dark, locked and I could see my bag inside. It has my outfit for the funeral and shoes. I tried to call and it was a 2 hour wait to get a call back by yet another rude representative. Never fly Alaska Airlines unless you enjoy getting treated like garbage

### "don't expect any support if you miss your flight"
Worst flight experience of my life (and I travel for work!). I was traveling SBP-SLO with a flight at 10.45am. Since I had no checked bags (despite traveling with a 1-year-old!) and already had my seat and boarding pass on my phone I arrived at airport an hour ahead of time. Waited in a long security line. Once at front was told I had to go to the check-in counter to print my pass and the printer was broken so I had to wait for some time. Once printed I was told to go back through security. There was a very long line but I made it to the gate 15min ahead of departure time. However, no one was there and once someone was retrieved I was told the door was just closed and they would not reopen. There was only 1x flight on this route per day and the next flight was not until the same time next day. My complaints: No announcement about the flight was heard (or even made?) in the security area. No attempt at all was made to ensure those who had checked in at the airport made the flight (I was not the only one to miss the flight). No apology was made - I was told to either rent a car and drive to Santa Barbara or wait for a flight the next day, which they made sound like I should be thankful they booked for me. No acknowledgement of the airline being at fault for any of this or desire to improve. I called to request a full refund given that I had to rent a car to drive to San Diego that night. They told me I should have canceled the flight that they had rebooked for me 24hr in advance, you mean before the flight was even re-booked? And that booking was made under the pressure of the moment with a screaming 1-year old in my arms while I was trying to consider how to make work the next day? And responsibility ultimately lay with me. I had to be back home for work which is why I had to rent a car and drive, but more than that, this is a flight I was hoping to take monthly in the future. If traveling with Alaska arrive well ahead of time and even then don't expect any support if you miss your flight due to airport - or airline-related failures. I have never had such an unpleasant experience with any airline and I'm frankly shocked that zero effort was made to account for paying passengers who were checked-in at the airport before a flight even began boarding.

### "staff at their guest services were no help"
My flight due to inclement weather on 2/3/22. Got rescheduled to 2/4. Got put on a stand by list for an earlier flight for today 2/4. And my name got shifted to number to 22 compared to 21 previously. Number 1-21 Got to fly. Now I have missed a family death. Thanks Alaska. My first time flying with them results in my last. The staff at their guest services were no help. I was told to call customer care. I waited on hold for 3 hours only to be belittled by the representative because I didn't call the insurance company due to my issue. Even though every rep in the airport didn't mention that and said my issue needs to be resolved by customer care.

### "I am never booking Alaska Airlines"
Not Verified | It’s been weeks and I still have not heard back from anyone! I have been attempting to call about my expired credits since before they even expired. $1374.40 is a lot of money to me and my family I have attempted several time before and after Dec.31. I was attempting to used my credits to book a trip to Hawaii for Valentines Day for my wedding Anniversary. I sat in queue for a callback yesterday and several other times during the month of December. For example I made my call at around 4 o’clock yesterday I wasn’t called back until 2 am. I was told in December if my need was not immediate then to call back do to inclement weather. After this experience I am never booking Alaska Airlines.

### "don't give Alaska Airlines your money in any way"
Not Verified |  I've been an Alaska Airline member for twenty-three years. I signed up for their credit card with one thought in mind - getting to Australia first-class for a prolonged vacation. My wife and I booked cruise tickets for 2020. Six months beforehand, I tried to get tickets but there were no FC tickets available. I was told I waited too long. So, we delayed the trip (probably a good thing thinking about it) so as to get tickets the day they opened. Lo and behold, no first-class tickets on the very first day I could book travel. This time I was told that I was too early and that they could only release tickets that they were given by partner airlines (eg none). I complained and was politely told that they only had to honor the mile for tickets that were "available" which they defined as those given to them. Now, having waited for my grievance to be heard, there are no more coach tickets available. And only on the days that my wife and I want to fly and two days on either side (what a coincidence). What I've been able to glean from case law, the airlines can promise whatever they want and change the rules whenever they want (and the courts back them up). That is almost the textbook definition of bait and switch. Don't get reeled into this insanity, and don't give Alaska Airlines your money in any way.

### "The absolute worst accommodations for customers"
The absolute worst accommodations for customers. We had a flight from Honolulu-NYC with a stop in Seattle. They did not serve tea or coffee, entire flight they just gave us a biscuit. Total of 11.5 hours of flights and they only served biscuits. Shameful and inhumane accommodations, then when we finally arrived in NYC they mishandled my luggage. As I am writing this review, it has been 12 hrs since we arrived and I was just informed that my luggage will arrive at 11pm today (amazing delivery time). I will never fly this ridiculous inhumane airlines ever again.

### "the wifi is so slow that it is a waste of money"
Not Verified |  Staff were great and friendly. However, you have to pay $20 for wifi, and the wifi is so slow that it is a waste of money, so I couldn't do any work on the plane. This is one of the only airlines without a monitor. I would recommend this airline for short plane rides, but long ones are rough. Also, not a lot of legroom.

### "the second and last time I use them"
Sadly I have to say the worst airline I have flown on. I'm from Alaska an they do not represent us, I don't know where to start, everything that can go wrong did. And good luck getting them on the phone or even at the airport for that matter, 7 hrs on the phone, I finally gave up and waited for a call back. They did not help or fix any of the problems! Made no effort to even try to act like they cared, even the other airline had nothing but disappointing things to say about the the invisible staff nowhere to be found. When on the phone they said they had staff at the booking counter but I was standing there. So disappointing, this is now the second and last time I use them. If you fly Alaska you know what I'm saying is unfortunately the truth. I should have learnt the 1st time. Best of luck to any one that makes the same mistakes I did. Just for fun try calling and see for yourself.

### "threaten not to allow us to board"
Our seats in first class had been given away. I told her we were checked in at SFO and this was completely unacceptable. She said she only had two seats available at the back of the plane and they were not together. I then asked for a supervisor. The gate manager came over looked at our reservation and attempted to put us on a 10pm flight with another airline she stated “It’s first class and you can be seated together but we can’t guarantee that flight won’t cancel so your other option is to take the seats we assigned then, call the 800 number to discuss a refund and good luck because this is happening with all the airlines”. At this point I became very upset and loudly told her this was not ok and expressed how I felt”. In hindsight I am sorry for my behavior and should not have taken my frustration out on her. She was doing the best she could given the circumstances. In a normal situation I would have cancelled our trip but unfortunately my husband had appointments schedule for the next two weeks in Costa Rica that we could not reschedule. We accepted the seat assignment but we’re not happy. As we were waiting to board I told my husband I was cancelling my credit card. The person who was boarding the passengers very loudly and extremely rudely told me to calm down (I wasn’t talking loudly nor was I even looking or talking to or at her)and would not allow us to board until I calmed down (I again was not showing any signs of anger or frustration).At this point I was near tears and did not reply. I simply walked away. My husband attempted to talk to her and she rudely told him no one is boarding. When I heard this I asked for her supervisor. The supervisor walked over and started reprimanding me about how they have been up since three o’clock that morning, they don’t have to put up with this (again at this time I was not even acknowledging her, was not even talking) and told my husband (again I was not talking or even acknowledging her or anyone else) she would take our bags off the plane and refund our tickets if I was going to cancel my credit card. I refused to even look engage in conversation with her. This action seemed to infuriate her and she demanded I “look at her while she was talking to me” then a proceeded to threaten not to allow us to board. At this point I was in tears but this did not seem to stop her barrage of unkindness. She stated “We are here to provide customer service and I obviously had no idea what that meant.! After we finished groveling and practically kissed her feet she then told the gate agent to open the door and let us board. She then checked my QR scan for Costa Rica (she was the third employee at this gate that had checked this) and said my passport number on the scan was 1 number wrong and she could not let me on the plane. At this point with tears streaming down my face she told the gate person to shut the door (it was on the plane 15 minutes later we found out we were being delayed because a crew member was not on the plane yet). She told me I had to fill out the form again. I was half way through when she said “Just take care of it in Costa Rica” at this point she told my husband she would allow us to board.

### "Alaska is still my airline of choice!"
Not Verified |  Flight to Austin on Dec 24 was uneventful. We received email notification that our return flight on the 27th was cancelled, and we were automatically rebooked for a flight on the 29th. That flight was delayed for 1 hour in Austin, and the SFO/Palm Springs leg by about 25 minutes. I must say that with all the cancellations that happened that week, we were lucky! I appreciated that auto rebooking, instead of having to spend hours on the phone. Alaska is still my airline of choice!

### "Worst airline ever"
Worst airline ever. I know I am just one person and the airline is big with many resources, but if this post helps just one other unsuspecting and trusting customer, then this effort would not have been in vain. We were going on a cruise, the ship leaving from LA. Our original air booking was a direct flight to LA (LAX) (07:00am - 9:50 am). However, Alaska reschedule this flight to two separate flights: a flight to Portland and a second flight from Portland to LA. The first flight was on time, but the second flight was delay long enough at Portland to result in us being too late to board our ship at 3:00pm(!!) - a cruise that we planned for more than year! Furthermore, when we rescheduled to return home the following day, we were told there were no more 1st class seats available and we will not be refunded the difference - yet when we boarded the plane, there were only two 1st class passengers on the plane! And, this flight too was delayed for more than 2 hours. Believe me, I will never fly Alaska again. We came all way, all excited, but all we got was just a look at the cruise ship.

### "airline is unprofessional"
Honolulu to Salt Lake City via Seattle. The airlines desk does not open in Honolulu until 8pm. Our flight was at 10:10 pm which you think would be ample time. Your checked baggage has to be looked through which took 45 minutes to get through. Their ticketing process as we timed it took about 20 minutes per customer! We had to still go through security! They were so slow that we barely made our flight. Once we got to the gate we were relieved until the flight attendants came and heard my 9 month old grand daughter coughing she had croup, which is not a sign of Covid. One of the flight attendants that had a power complex decided to tell my daughter that the baby could not get on the plane. Panicking the mother (who has been a flight attendant for 15 years), into tears. When they called the doctor at the airport he listened to her and said she was fine. Half of the people on the plane were coughing much harder. As we boarded the same flight attendant asked how the baby was I said she's fine - she turned to her fellow flight attendant and mimicked me while pulling a face. After we boarded she was not very professional the whole flight. This airline is unprofessional, unorganized and does not seem to care. If you do after reading this you get what you deserve!

### "website does not allow to select refund"
Two flights delayed this week. They automatically rebooked my trip for Sacramento for a time after my meeting in Sacramento, and then delayed the rebooked flight as well. I went to cancel and their website does not allow to select refund. Tried to call- 4hr wait. Tried to chat and 6hrs later still no reply. I received a credit I would very much not like to use. Nothing but issues last 4 months. Communication and reliability have gone down hill.

### "worst airline I have ever used"
Alaska Airlines is the worst airline I have ever used. I paid $890 to go from CA to Vegas and arrive the same day. Due to delays and cancellations, I did not arrive at my destination for 28 hours. I could have paid $200 to go the next day, but I wanted to arrive the same day. Instead, I spent 24 hours in the Seattle airport waiting for a “delayed” flight that never took place. After 24 hours in the airport, I did finally get a different flight to Vegas. When I attempted to get the difference of the same day flight and the next day flight ($690) they told me they are under no obligation to reimburse me since I did, eventually, arrive at my destination. Also, when calling customer service, I was told that the wait time before my call would be answered was 42 hours, 40 hours, and 46 hours. I eventually was given the option of having customer service return my call, which took over 10 hours. During that call, I was on hold over an hour waiting to talk to a supervisor. I advise anyone looking for an airline to avoid Alaska Airlines at all cost!

### "avoid flying Alaska Airlines at all costs"
Alaska airlines ruined or vacation. We spent 4 days dealing with cancelled and delayed flights (I could go on for days with all we had to deal with) and the worst part is that Alaska Airlines didn’t have the staff capacity for us to get all our cancelled flights rebooked. We waited in lines for hours to rebook several flights because they only had 2-3 people working at the customer service desk and when we tried to call to rebook, we never received a call back from them. Some of the employees were helpful and kind but some were extremely rude and clearly stressed. The cherry on top was that they lost our bag with our ski gear in it (the whole point of the trip was to ski) and we still haven’t heard anything back from them about our lost bag (they lost our bag a week and a half ago). Also when we did finally get on a flight is was SO dirty. They clearly do not clean their planes at all.. which is pretty concerning during a pandemic. Attached is a picture of the Lysol wipe I used to clean only my seat. So long story short, we ended up paying an extra $700+ because of hotel rooms needed due to cancelled flights and also items purchased due to lost luggage (they couldn’t find any of our bags after the first cancelled flight). Alaska won’t get back to us but when we do finally get a chance to talk to someone, I’m sure they won’t deem it’s us for any of that. Just take it from me, please avoid flying Alaska Airlines at all costs. I don’t want want one to have to go through what we went through.

### "Worst time management I've seen from anyone"
Not Verified |  Never ever will I spend a single cent on Alaska Airlines again. They delayed the flight 15 minutes from its original time which I can live with. Departure was 6.35 and Boarding started at 5.40. However they didn't start boarding the plane until it was supposed to be taking off. We had to wait an additional hour for them to load the luggage on the plane. The flight was supposed to get in at 9.14 but didn't get in til 10.05. Worst time management I've seen from anyone.

### "good flight and service"
Not Verified | Overall good flight and service. I can't complain The flight from Atlanta was late leaving for fueling but it was s good flight. The return flight also left late but the staff were courteous

### "the worst airline ever"
Not Verified | This is the worst airline ever, I can't even begin to say how inconvenient. After delaying my flight, "undelaying" my flight, delaying it again, they cancelled it and where not able to book me another flight in a reasonable time. If you are going to cancel a flight due to weather, there is no reason you can't simply delay it 24/48 hours instead of all out cancelling. I have also flown with them multiple times and always sign up for text or email updates on flight status and they've never sent me an email on flight status.

### "has poor customer service"
Alaska Airlines has poor customer service. Overbook their flights over sales, ensures that every plane requires people to check luggage because they overbook. Out of 8 round trip flights every flight has been delayed except for 1. They could care less, they are always delayed. I’d suggest to book with a different airline and save yourself a headache.

### "will never fly Alaska airlines again"
Not Verified | The airplane was 2 hours late to Sacramento for a flight to Seattle and then a transfer to another Alaska flight to Vancouver. I missed my transfer flight, my covid 72 hour test expired because of the flight to Vancouver delay. I was forced to stay overnight in Seattle and take a $250 covid test the next morning. The plane to Vancouver had scraped paint on it and looked like it was falling apart. I will never fly Alaska airlines again if I can help it. Very narrow isles.

### "never ever again Alaska"
This airline is a joke. I’ll never book a flight with them again. We had a flight from lax to Newark and we waited on taxi mode for 1h20 min. Now that we’re trying to go back home they just postpone take off the time. Also, i asked the girl at the gate to change my son’s seat because we had a car seat and didn’t want to be separated. And without asking if that was ok, she moved us from row 18 to row 32. She did that without asking. This is not ok. As I’m writing this, the plane is two hours late. As i said, never ever again Alaska. And ps: they don’t have any screens on their planes for flights longer than 5hours.

### "Alaska you are the worst"
Not Verified |  Promised early boarding if they checked some of our carry-on luggage. Against my better judgment and gut feeling, and being assured it would arrive with me. Nearly 2 hours later at IAH they are trying to find my and others luggage. Ticketing agent was extremely rude, to me and everyone who was there. Someone is on the way, yea right. So no luggage, rude people, having to walk out on the tarmac to board an airplane like eons ago. I will never fly Alaska again. Full Stop! Another place will describe the very dirty dysfunction IAH Airport. Bathrooms down right nasty. I needed my carry on. Going to a hospital here. Need my things for my stay. Alaska you are the worst.

### "extremely patient and helpful"
Review is for customer service person, Rafael. Four friends and I needed extensive help to use credit we had from a cancelled 2020 reservation. Rafael from customer service office was extremely patient and helpful. He walked me through multiple steps (including registering for a mileage plan, finding each icon on the website I needed to click on in order to enter credit data and reservation data. He explained the difference between a confirmation number, a certificate code, a certificate pin number, etc. He never lost his temper even though he needed to repeat himself multiple times, and waited for me to complete each step to ensure I was inputting everything properly and navigating to the next step successfully. This took a considerable amount of time, but in the end I was able to rebook our flight for the 5 of us for April 4th from LAX to Portland and return April 10 (on first class) which would not have been possible without Rafael's assistance. No wonder you have him in customer service. He promotes excellence, efficiency and customer-centered service for Alaska Airlines. We are grateful for Rafael. I hope you feel the same way from your excellent employee.

### "terrible customer service"
Baggage service misplaced our bags, no apologies just jokes. Took one and a half hours to rectify. Agent in Baggage services has no business being a supervisor anywhere. The customer service rep just sat and ignored me, terrible customer service.

### "they wouldn’t help us in any sort of way"
Not Verified |  The worst costumer service I have experienced flying, we had a horrible experience with our flights. First they changed our flight dates and times 20 times, without a warning or a call. Then on our last flight returning home, we arrive to check-in our bag 1 minute late and they wouldn’t late us get checked in and they made us miss our flight. It’s a policy of the airline so we sort of understood. However the person behind the counter + the manager treated us so badly, they spoke to us in a loud and sassy tone that it was unacceptable. Not only they spoke rudely to us, they wouldn’t help us in any sort of way. We had to wait +10 hours to try to get into another flight which they couldn’t even guarantee until the last minute of the flight boarding. When we went to ask the people on the desk about information on the flight they where even more rude than the ones in the morning. They brushed us off several times, and they even told me not to bother them again with any questions, when of course we were worried it was 1 am with nowhere to stay to sleep if we weren’t able to catch the flight. Not only that, after they kept us with the intrigue of waiting we where finally able to get in the flight. The pilot was horrible, the flight moved like a blender and a lot of passengers were scared, I have been in other flights where the pilot apologizes for the movement and warned in advance for what was coming, everything was taken by a surprise. Also if you ever fly with this airline on a 7 hour flight they won’t pass anything more than a cracker and sell you a cold nasty plate of fruit and cheese so be ready to bring snacks and food. On our flight to Alaska we did 7 hours from Miami to Seattle without any food then when we arrived to Seattle it was 11pm and everything was closed. Then we had to take a 4h flight to anchorage and arrive at 2 am with everything closed.

### "an unacceptable way to treat people"
Not Verified |  I will never fly this airline again. This was the worst flying experience I ever had. They made us wait at the gate for 2 hours. Then at midnight cancelled our flight. They had 2 people at the desk to help about 300. I called customer service as I waited and after holding for an hour I got someone to help me on the phone. She advised that I can either let them rebook me in the airport or she can issue a refund and I can rebook my own travel. Since there were several hundred people in front of me I asked if I could rebook my own travel and have AA put me in a hotel foe the night since at this point it was 2am. She said she can refund me and I need to continue to wait on the line and will receive a hotel voucher. I waited till my turn at 3.30am. When I was helped the agent issued my hotel voucher. Then I asked about my refund and she proceeded to cancel my hotel reservation telling me they don’t give vouchers if you received a refund. When I explained I followed exactly what the customer service agent told me to do she ignored me and continued to repeat the same thing. I had to find and pay for my own hotel and taxis. This is offensive and an unacceptable way to treat people. If you cancel a flight at midnight thereby leaving you clearly stranded, the airline who stranded you and then advised you to get a refund should put you in a hotel. This is basic human decency.

### "Horrible experience with customer service"
Not Verified |  What a joke of an airline. I showed up to my flight and the flight was cancelled with no notification and no one at the counter to talk to. Horrible experience with customer service from start to finish. Go elsewhere.

### "cancel the service you paid for"
Not Verified |  We booked a flight for 2:55pm, then we changed it to a refundable 1st class ticket for 9:00am. Later, Alaska airlines cancelled that flight and tried to move us to a flight that wouldn't put us at our destination in time. so we had to cancel the flight outright however, Alaska Airlines only refunded $80.00 per ticket and put the remaining $1100.00 in a "wallet" which we wont be able to use before it expires. So they offer a service, then cancel the service you paid for, then keep your money. this was going to be our first time flying Alaska but to be treated like this? We will never fly Alaska Airlines.

### "not be using Alaska Airlines again"
Stewardesses have been extremely rude to myself, the persons in the seats next to me, & a person in front of me in seat 6a. I am in seat 7C. The stewardess shoved the persons arm away in seat 7b when he was attempting to toss garbage out. The stewardess had a tag on her back & when I told her about it & tried to remove for her she “snapped” at me for trying to remove it. Also a 6 hour flight with no entertainment? I paid for internet service which was an inconvenience considering there should be in-flight entertainment which when booking my tickets it stated there would be. I will more than likely not be using Alaska Airlines again because of the rude service.

### "flight arrived very late and we nearly missed our next flight"
Our flight arrived very late and we nearly missed our next flight. Then our bags didn't show up. I shudder to think what would've happened if we missed our next flight as we had the last flight to our destination for the day. Would a hotel and meals have been paid for by Alaska or would we be out of luck? Also, the baggage fee was an unpleasant surprise. We had flight credit which should've taken care of this fee but nope!

### "Punctual, Professional and Passionate"
Punctual, Professional and Passionate. This best describes the flight crew. Alaska brings civility back to flying. The seats are comfortable with excellent legroom. The interior including Lavs are extremely clean. The drink selection is excellent. Yes, they serve alcohol. The IFEE is top-notch. Plus, there is complimentary WiFi for texting, Facebook and WhatsApp. Fly Alaska, and experience the difference.

### "Alaska, you are the absolute worst"
Not Verified |  I have been an Alaska Airlines member and consumer using the Bank of America Alaska Rewards card for many years now. Each year I have paid an annual fee for benefits I've never been able to utilize. In all these years, I paid more than the going rate (comparing similar flights/dates/times on Travelocity/Priceline/Kayak) to fly many times just to use miles or what they call their companion fare. Every time it's worked out to be more expensive. Every time I feel cheated. This company tricks you into believing that there is some benefit to membership, but there is none. I have booked flights and had them cancelled due to COVID, but then they would not refund the money back. During this same pandemic, United and Southwest Airlines refunded my flights without question. They have held hostage hundreds of dollars of funds in what they call my wallet, which expires somehow, without any decency to refund it. I believe through my interactions that this company falsely advertises their services and their rates. Almost every representative I've worked with have had an attitude that really does represent this company exactly as I understand them, disgracefully arrogant and insulting! I despise very few companies, but Alaska, you are the absolute worst! Save your money, your time, your patience and do not ever do business with this company.

### "Great flight, flight crew was kind"
Not Verified |  Great flight, short and quick flight, the landing and takeoffs were smooth and the flight crew was kind. Took quite a while to get off the gate, boarding was fast though. Legroom was great and the seat comfort was ok but for being premium economy, I was quite impressed!

### "refusing to reimbursee us"
Not Verified |  So beyond disappointed with Alaska. We flew Oct 7th to Mexico. 5 families (1-2 individuals from each group) that we know about missed their flight that day. We were originally told it was due to kiosk issues (that is why their lines were not moving and people's tickets were being flagged) We had to spend 24 hrs in the airport and take 3 flights to get to our families (husband and 3yo and 5yo) in Mexico without us with no clothes) . We were told by customer service to purchase anything we may need to get us through the 24 hrs. Now Alaska management and customer service is telling us food, blanket, shuttle, pillow and medication were not necessities and refusing to reimbursee us. I did buy head phones and I guess it depends on who you ask if those are a necessity. It has been nothing but a fight the entire time trying to get compensation for the trouble. I have been a avid Alaska flyer for over 10years. And I am beyond upset with how we have been treated by management and customer service. I do not recommend them any longer.

### "I completely missed my connecting flight"
Pilot was 1.5 hours late, making the flight over 2 hours late to arrive in Anchorage from Seattle. The flight had to get a "rescue pilot". This made me completely miss my flight through Ravn Airlines to Kenai Alaska, so my father had to drive 3.5 hours one way to pick me up in Anchorage. Going back home, the flight was 45 mins late leaving Anchorage, so I completely missed my connecting Alaska flight from Seattle to Omaha. The customer service lady had to book me on a flight through Delta 2 hours later. I would have made the flight if she has just called over to the other terminal to let them know the plane just landed and I was on my way but she refused to do so.

### "the worst experience I’ve had with any airline"
Not Verified |  This is the worst experience I’ve had with any airline. We have deplaned two airplanes already. Literally need to give all passengers on this flight a refund. It’s Halloween and I guess the tricks is on us. I’m sure everyone on here agrees flight 475 is a pure disaster. I will never book them again, I don’t care if I have to drive from Atlanta to California that would be much better than this horrible experience. This airline needs to be closed and sold to Delta.

### "pure torture with this airline"
My family of four was returning from a trip to Seattle (Tuesday) with five checked in bags. Only three made it. That stuff happens in the industry and that is not my complaint. What occurred over the next 36 hours was pure torture with this airline. It started with no one being present to help us report the missing bags. So I used the telephone number and engaged with a very pleasant person who took down all of the information and assigned me an incident number, sending me an email with a portal connection that I could check on the status of the bags. No one contacted me whatsoever during the day and only later at 7:30 PM (Wednesday) did I call them and ask what the status was. It was clear to me that the person that I was speaking with, who was again very pleasant on the phone, was simply a part-time person obviously working from home and had a real disconnect with anyone in the baggage department at Alaska in EWR. In fact, there is no baggage department at Newark Airport for Alaska. They only come on a few minutes before a flight arrival and leave within 10 minutes after the last bag is discharged. All I received were promises that they would reach out to the baggage people when they reported for duty and make sure that the bags were delivered to my home. Every time I spoke with anyone I received the same story. At 1130 the next day (Thursday) I finally was able to reach a manager. I told her that we were now going on 36 hours and I did not see any effort whatsoever by the airline to get the bags back to me. The bags were placed on a later flight and at least I had comfort in knowing that they were in the airport. The manager promised me that she would call when persons were present in the baggage room at 1 o'clock. I did not hear from her and called her at just before 2 o'clock. She admitted that she had not had a chance to call but asked me to be placed on hold and she would call down there right away. After a few minutes she got back on and told me that no one was in the baggage room to pick up the phone. This was standard procedure amongst all personnel. This included a real estate broker working out of Putnam County, New York who apparently is doing customer relations part-time for this airline who sent me an email advising me that they were not responsible for the bags since they were now being held by another airline. I sent her an email asking her to call me but I never did receive a call. She was probably out showing a new listing for a booming real estate business here in the Northeast. All of these people had a chance to make a difference in an individual's life. All of them failed and it is a reflection on this airline that there is no connection between their baggage customer staff and the actual key people that are there 20 minutes before and airline lands and 10 minutes after to work together. It is a major disconnect. I doubt their new CEO will be aware of this. I know that he only took the position as of March of this year. Unfortunately for him, this was my first experience with Alaska Airlines. It will be my last. I will say that the individuals that I spoke to by telephone were all very pleasant but they had absolutely no ability to help me because of the clear disconnect between what they can do and their need to speak with people on the ground that are the real individuals that can help out. In the end, I took the 1 Hour drive back to the airport to get the two bags and will drive the hour back.

### "treated my elderly parents horribly"
I was a long time business customer of Alaska and an MVP until they they treated my elderly parents horribly and it makes me sick to my stomach that a company can do this to the elderly and those who need assistance in language and disability as indicated on their ticket. On 9/19/21 my parents were removed from a flight and forced to sleep on the airport floor until I could get them a flight the next morning. My mother was taking a drink for her blood pressure medication and was immediately removed from the flight. She did not in any way refuse to wear a face mask. As a matter of fact she showed it to the flight attendant and told her she was taking medicine (drinking water is allowed). Alaska says the staff was “tired”. Their tickets indicated they needed language and disability assistance. Alaska’s treatment of the elderly and disabled is horrible and I will not stand by it. I’ve cancelled my business and personal credit cards with them.

### "I would never intrust Alaskan Airlines with the safety of my family again"
We boarded a plane home from Costa Rica. When getting in our seats my husband pulled down his mask to communicate to our children where to sit. The flight attendant immediately told my husband to put his mask on, which my husband did. My husband explained he was trying to help our children. The flight attendant then told us we were going to be a problem. This made us uneasy. Right after this another flight attendant started yelling at another passenger about their mask and threatened to extradite the man. At this point I had the worst feeling about the flight. We settled into the flight. My children were doing great and were behaving the best they had on any flight. My son's mask was a little loose. I had given him the 32 degree masks from Costco and they slip. The flight attendant reminded my son to pull up his mask, which he did. Not too long after the flight attendant came to me and told me he had reminded us a lot to put up our masks. My husband told him it had only been two times. The steward began to argue with my husband. I told the steward a firm thank you and he left. At this point I didn't dare rest my eyes. I kept checking my children's masks. My oldest sons mask did slip down again but I would hurry and make sure he had it up. Not once did we ever refuse to wear our masks. Not once were we unruly or trying to be a problem on the flight. We were in the last row of the plane right next to the flight attendant cabin. We could hear them talking bad about the passengers and how awful they were. They seemed really worked up. I then heard the steward say they might have law enforcement waiting for someone at the end of the flight. I heard another female flight attendant say, " I didn't ask for that to happen. He responded, "Well it's done! In the back of my mind I was thinking is he talking about us? I quieted my fears and thought it must be the man they had threatened to extradite. By the conversations I was picking up in the back from the flight attendants it seemed like this particular flight attendant really enjoyed the power and was excited to watch seeing someone get kicked off. It was like he could use it at his next gathering of flight attendants where they could tell the crazy stories of what had happened to them. Not okay at the expense of a family just trying to get home with as little problems as possible. Well luckily it wasn't law enforcement, but it was Alaska Airlines employees who handed us a letter that said our connecting flight had been canceled and we are now banned from flying with Alaska Airlines. We tried to tell them that we had tried to comply and that it had been exaggerated, but they wouldn't even let us talk. So here we are a young family of 5, stranded in LA. The same day flights were all $1000 for each family member. We rode a bus to Enterprise who was all out of one way cars. Luckily, there was an amazing employee there. We told him what happened. He got us a van even though he knew he might get in trouble. Honestly, it healed my heart to see someone care after we were treated so badly. We then drove home and arrived safely the next day. All is well that ends well, except I thought this should be shared. I would never intrust Alaskan Airlines with the safety of my family again.

### "it was a fantastic flight"
We just flew on flight number 2071 Alaska airlines and wanted to say it was a fantastic flight. I want to give special props to the flight attendant Ralph who really made that flight pleasant. He made everyone smile and feel at ease about the flight and his personality really shined. Thank you Ralph it was a great way to start our day.

### "Disappointing airline"
Not Verified |  Disappointing airline. I’m MVP Gold. Constantly attempt to redeem all my complementary upgrade codes only to be continually told “there are no available seats for upgrade.” Need to wait until the end of the year and find a new airline to commit to.

### "be the last time I fly with Alaska"
Not Verified |  I take this flight because it’s the only direct flight from OKC to SEA. Recently my husband left for boot camp and I bought tickets back in July for November since they’re cheaper then. Called today to ask to change my husbands name to mine so our 6 year old is not flying alone and they said we will refund a portion of his and you can rebuy your ticket; but you’re tickets will not be together. So my daughter will possibly fly alone? This will be the last time I fly with Alaska and we will be using other airlines to go back to see family from now on.

### "they stuff me in a middle seat "
Every time I fly with Alaska Airlines they stuff me in a middle seat between large, rude people, who give me no space, trigger severe anxiety attacks, and make my flights uncomfortable. This time, I followed a friend's advice, and asked about changing seats or upgrading, and was refused. Covid is still real, quit stuffing people in these planes like sardines, or you are just contributing to the spread of the virus.

### "Treatment of customers has gone way down"
Not Verified |  Treatment of customers has gone way down. If you want to pay a high price to be treated like a hostage go ahead and book with Alaska Airlines. Stewardesses are just shy of blatantly rude and customer service at the gate couldn't be bothered to ask a question. Her rolling eyes and sarcasm spoke volumes about her career satisfaction. I will not fly with this airline again.

### "Alaska seems to have lost a little quality"
Alaska seems to have lost a little quality, going from very good/excellent to good/very good. Not a huge slip in quality, but still noticeable when my prior experiences flying on Alaska have been excellent. The check-in agents in Houston were grumpy and discourteous, not only did not exchange pleasantries with passengers, they just weren't pleasant. On the flight from Houston Bush to Seattle-Tacoma, the jet was dirty and looked like it hadn't been cleaned in a couple of days. I say it was the second or third dirtiest jet I've ever flown on. The catering in Houston had dropped the ball on some meals that passengers had ordered, including mine, but the crew offered for me to have another available meal that cost the same, which I accepted - and which was tasty. The crew were polite, focused and professional, but not very friendly. Just robotic. They weren't rude, but they seemed kind of intense, which is something I didn't expect from Alaska. I also purchased in-flight WiFi, which turned out to be slow, it didn't stream the videos I wanted and didn't let me even go a simple Google search. I'm still not happy about that. Now, the flight from Seattle-Tacoma to Portland was better, quicker boarding, much nicer and cleaner plane, much more cheerful and appreciative flight attendants. So, for now, I will continue to fly them when I can and be a Mileage Plus member for the foreseeable future, but Alaska may sadly have lost a slight bit of its way during a pandemic which has required them to reduce service and cut costs otherwise, and it's really a shame. Even so, as of now, I'd still rather fly with Alaska than American, Southwest, or any US budget carrier.

### "The staff were so rude and condescending"
Not Verified |  Will never take Alaska Airlines again, ever! The staff were so rude and condescending to one poor lady who seemed confused about her seating arrangement! I was warned prior to booking my flight not to take Alaska Airlines due to many issues with them but had miles to use and they had the better rate. Never again! In this day and age, when cost is vital, I will gladly pay any amount extra to avoid using Alaska Airlines. Due to their treatment of others I have also informed my employer to never book me flights using Alaska Airlines in the future.

### "staff were very rude and belligerent to those around them"
Not Verified |  I was met with the worst customer service I’ve ever encountered. I do not recommend anyone fly this airline. You’d be better off driving. The staff were very rude and belligerent to those around them. The airline also will make it known how political they are and will attack you if you do not agree with them. I thought flying on an airline was supposed to be pleasant? Not this one.

### "worst experience I’ve ever had"
The customer service lady was a nightmare. I’m disabled and have certified service dog. I had made arrangements for assistance (wheelchair door to plane) before flight. When I went to get my ticket the clerk was rude and disrespectful. She refused to assist me and wasn’t going to let my service dog on the plane with me. She wouldn’t even let me talk or explain anything to me. My trip started with my flight from Houston Texas to Los Angeles California on United. All my flights have always been on United (great experience each time). Somewhere along the way my return flight was changed (American Airlines bought my ticket). I excepted the change, after all I need to get home. That’s why I contacted Alaska Airlines in advance to setup assistance and my service dog information. It was the worst experience I’ve ever had. I had to walk from Alaska to American and then catch shuttle to broad my flight. At which time a fight broke out over the company gave away a guys seat. I can’t wait to get home and never fly any American Airline owned plane again. Best of luck to those who do. I thank God for helping me get home safe.

### "Sat waiting for the pilot"
Terrible! Sat waiting for the pilot who just had flown in from Anchorage. Had a small carton of water for us- no offer of anything else while we waited and waited. Plane kept getting hotter and hotter. How in the world are you going to schedule flights weeks in advance and not have a pilot scheduled!? This was a ridiculous. No wifi while we waited and no apology.

### "Great customer service and helpful support"
Not Verified |  I accidentally booked the wrong flight. Alaska was able to switch me from a Sunday return to a Monday return on short notice. Great customer service and helpful support. Recommend to everyone.

### "never fly this airline again"
Worst Flight ever. The plane turned around on the runway, right before take off. A passenger pushed the call button and wanted off the plane. So they made the decision to go back to to the gate and inconvenience the whole flight for 2 hours! We took off two hours later. They have really bad customer service! We will never fly this airline again.

### "They had no compassion and no options"
Not Verified |  I had the worst experience yesterday at the Pasco Washington airport. The Alaska Airlines representative was so rude and no help after he told me I can't check my bag, that I missed the window to check in my bag after I had waited in line for almost an hour. I had my toddler and infant with me. Seeing I was clearly agitated from waiting all that time and had people cutting in line and being able to check their bags and catching the flight he was smirking and offered no help other than to call customer service. After this I went to speak to Delta and they even offered to try to help me. I purchased a two-way flight originally and then had to purchase another ticket one way for missing the flight the day before, totalling $1500. They had no compassion and no options. Finally got a hold of customer service and ranted and finally got a way home for the next morning. I will never fly with Alaska Airlines again. I recommend Delta or United.

### "this was a good experience"
Overall this was a good experience. Though they had absolutely no desire to adhere to mask mandates at the gate, they almost kicked someone of the plane for their inappropriate behavior prior. This person was absolutely obnoxious, acting like a 12 year old (despite being at least 35). Being outspoken about his opinions, like a broken record. Everyone got to suffer. They should have kicked him off, but at least they pretended to care while on the plane. Everything else was on point for the most part

### "the best flight experience"
Not Verified |  I had the best flight experience ever on June 24, 2021 from Kona to San Diego. The flight attendants were caring and made the flight easy and enjoyable. I am a runner so I needed to stretch a little in the back near the lavatories and the flight attendant I spoke with was extremely affable and understanding. I hadn't planned on any more than 5 mins but I struck a conversation with the attendant sitting in back and I was particularly impressed with her demeanor. Thank you amazing flight attendant!

### "This airline will take any opportunity to rob you in daylight"
Due to a covid restriction, flight could not be taken. AA did not even refund or give the decency of a credit - even if I had bought the basic ticket, they simply did not care. Daylight robbery with dreadful customer service to help find a resolution. This airline will take any opportunity to rob you in daylight.

### "trip has been so disrespectful"
In the past I have mainly booked flights through United and American. This past week I booked a trip with Alaska from Tulum to Washington DC and then today form Washington to Los Angeles. My experience on this trip has been so disrespectful that I could not wait to land in order to write this review. My friend and I are sitting by side in aisle seats and were clearly eating and literally saying few words in between. The flight attendant says “you guys need to out your masks on between Your bites.” As well start to comply, he adds with a nastier attitude “You’ve had them on way too long.” We complied and didn’t say anything back. Shortly after he is going down the aisle to pass out beverages. He approached our aisle and started in the side he has been starting on (based in the sequence he kept coming down the aisle towards us.) He asked my friend/co-traveler what he would like to drink and he literally did not wait for a response. He turned away before he can answer then asked the people beside me against the window what they would like to drink. His attitude is clearly intentional and offensive. He finally asked me what u would like to drink. I responded asking for a water. He then gives me the water and with an attitude says “you're welcome” and continued on.

### "we should have been given direction"
My wife was flying out of Seattle to Moscow with Alaska Airlines so we got to the airport early because it was an international flight. As soon as we walk into the airport we went straight to the check-in where there was a big line. We waited in line for about 20 minutes only to find out by the customer service lady that we had to go to the self-check-in machines and add tags to our luggage and then return at the end of the line! When I complained and said that we should have been given direction when first joining the line, not at the end she said 'oh well there's nothing I can do about it". We then tried to get tags for the luggage, the machine couldn't find my wife's name on the flight so I went back and asked the customer service lady why? and she said to go to the 'Customer Assistance" booth. At the CA booth, they said, "oh, it's because it's an international final destination you should have come to this booth from the beginning!

### "Alaska Airlines is the worst"
Alaska Airlines is the worst! They sold us a ticket, changed the flight over to an American Airlines flight without giving us any notification, had no one at the airport to tell us why our flight had been cancelled and that it had been changed and then would not answer their phone for several hours! We wasted all day at the airport and then had to pay a fee to American Airlines to change to a flight the next day because we "missed our flight" even though we were at the airport 2 hours before the flight but could not find anyone from Alaska Airlines to tell what was going on! Had to pay for another night in New Orleans, had to miss work the following day and had the most miserable stressful experience ever! I have written to (and called several times!) Alaska Airlines customer service to try to get them to contact me about this and they don't even respond.

### "I asked to speak to a manager and was denied"
Not Verified |  I was planning a trip with my wife and 2 daughters. I thought we had the perfect trip planned until there was a flight change. Instead of departing at 7.50 am, I received notification that it would be changed to 7 am. This caused an overlap in our scheduled and changed out the whole trip. I spoke to the Supervisor out of the call center in Boise, and she stated that the policy was that since it was only a 50-minute difference and not a 60-minute change per policy, they could not refund the amount. They should be able to make exceptions when it's it's close to their refund requirements. I asked to speak to a manager and was denied. I'm more than disappointed in Alaska Airlines, and I would not recommend them for travel.

### "some of the poorest customer service"
Not Verified |  Family members flew from Seattle to Helena on 7/16/2021 for a weekend with family. Their return flight was to leave Helena on 7/18/2021 at 2:55 pm. My family members arrived on time, checked in, printed boarding passes and passed through security. After waiting past scheduled boarding time, they were told by Alaska Airlines employees, there would be a delay and the flight would not leave until 4:15 pm. After that time came and went, they were told the flight was cancelled. Alaska Airlines offered no assistance in booking another flight and ultimately told them their flight was rescheduled to 7/20/2021, two days later. This puts the working person in a very awkward position; missing work, losing pay and the cost of a local motel room, just to mention a few. My family members were able to find another flight with another airline, completely without the help of Alaska Airlines. They were also told there would be no refund. I would gladly have my flight information verified but since I did not pay for the flight I do not have such information but trust me, Alaska Airlines has some of the poorest customer service I have ever seen and display a total lack of regard for their customers. I would not recommend flying Alaska Airlines if it can be avoided.

### "Everything seemed to be everyone else's department"
Not Verified |  Alaska cancelled our connecting flight without notice. Added hours to our layover with a 10 month old. Staff were at best completely useless, at worst insulting with their placations. Alaska must have a lot of people with an unofficial title of "Professional Useless Person" given the enormous number of Alaska staff walking around. Everything seemed to be everyone else's department. It's amazing how many employees you need to tell someone to call customer service. This used to be a great airline. Now it is my last choice.

### "refused to reimburse for the full amount"
Flying back from San Francisco to Los Angeles on a Saturday after a one day work trip, I received an email when I awoke offering me a $250 voucher to change my flight to another day -- I was supposed to fly out at 1030pm after a day of work to get home to see my family and we had plans the following morning. So I naturally ignored the email. Cut to 6pm, when I am informed the 1030pm flight has been canceled and I am flying out the next day at 530pm. After getting on with reservations to change my flight out to 930am the following morning and maybe salvage some of my plans (I couldn't ultimately), I didn't receive a confirmation email about my itinerary. I called back a few hours later and requested it again. Still did not receive an email. Had to call a third time -- it's 1130pm by this point -- and demand an email to be sent while I sat on the phone. However, all that was sent was a receipt, but I was assured I was on the flight. Cut to 8am Sunday, the following morning at SFO and I can't check in at a kiosk. After an hour of standing in line at the zoo in front of the Alaska Air check in stations, I get my boarding passes and am told to call Customer Care (closed till Monday) about being reimbursed for everything I spent while having to stay the extra night in San Francisco. This is important -- I asked how to deal with reimbursement. They told me just to call customer care with no instruction -- all operators, all people I talked to in Alaska air outfits at the airport. So I call customer care. They honor the vouchers they suspiciously sent me earlier in the day on Saturday -- though the operator gets super defensive when I ask why the flight was canceled, she said crew issues, and I ask if they knew that was going to happen with the voucher email -- but demand ALL reimbursements have ITEMIZED receipts. NO ONE told me to do this -- I had receipts for everything but not all of them were itemized. Finally the operator admitted to me that Alaska had limited staff, tons of layoffs, tons of people retiring, etc and it becomes a domino effect down to the customers. However, they still refused to reimburse for the full amount. Despite them canceling the flight. Despite giving zero instruction about how to properly get reimbursed. Despite wasting hours of my time just to get myself home. Dont fly with them until they get their house is in order (that will probably be a while). And if you do, there's a good chance your flight will be canceled -- I'd actually flown with them a month before and they did the same thing, only booked my family on a flight just a few hours later, so it was not a big deal. And if they do cancel your flight, itemize your receipts and stay in the most expensive hotel you can possibly find a room in.

### "were absolutely unwilling to help us"
First leg of the trip we paid hundreds of dollars to choose our seats and make sure our family was together since we have two kids. Well, they "couldn't find" our seats even though I had a very detailed receipt in my email, when I showed them the email they were like "ooohhh not sure why that didn't come up in our system. Well, we already gave those seats away so we will have to split up your family. To make matters even more laughable, even though I paid hundreds to have specific seats, 3 of us were seated in the very back row against the bathroom. We had a 45 minute layover, I let them know that before boarding and I was told that "45 minutes was plenty of time", it wasn't. The flight released us late because no one was at the gate to get us off so we sat on the tarmac for about a half hour making us late for our next flight. But that didn't matter because our next flight was delayed 3.5 hours due to mechanical malfunction. I begged to be put on a flight to another airport in the DC area (there were two leaving shortly, one to BWI and one to Dulles), they had enough seats for my family but the employees I spoke to complained that the paperwork would "take 5 minutes" and were absolutely unwilling to help us. I guess they already had our money so didn't care if we were happy or not. Both planes were old and beat up, totally uncomfortable. I fly quite often and have never had so many problems. Never again, Alaska Airlines.

### "flight got delayed 2h+"
These people are utterly incompetent. The flight got delayed 2h+ by incremental delays of 30 minutes. The company doesn't know how to plan, estimate or manage itself.

### "Horrible customer service"
Horrible customer service. Tried to get on an earlier flight since they said there was a “ton of empty seats”. We were told to call reservations to switch, they told us since we bought “the cheap seats” they weren’t going to do anything. I asked if if I could speak to a supervisor, after 10 mins she came on and said that they won’t do anything if you buy the “cheapest seats”. If this is how you treat people, just because we bought the “cheap” seats, I don’t want to do business with you!! We purchased the WiFi in flight on way to Juneau and it didn’t work at all. So we wasted $10. Very frustrating and annoying when they have such long layovers! !

### "An excellent experience"
An excellent experience. Unlike other carriers Alaska is back to full service with a smile. Excellent light lunch (can be pre ordered) plus snacks offered. Great service.

### "She was the best of the best!"
Not Verified |  I flew with Heyka as our first class flight attendant! She was out of this world next level amazing! She made you feel so comfortable and taken care of. We never wanted or needed for anything! She was the best of the best! Flight 196, July 3rd.

### "told I needed to go get another test"
When I booked my trip to Hawaii I went to Alaska Airlines and I read through the Alaska Airlines travel guidelines. I was told that I would need to provide a printed out lab result showing a negative COVID, so three days prior and that’s what I did. There was no mention when they took my money for the ticket or even when I took my flight to LA that there was specific trusted locations that Hawaii would only accept. It is only mentioned if you go to a specific link within the site. I was told I could go to Hawaii but I’d be sent home at my own expense or id be forced to quarantine and pay for a hotel for ten days. The manager refused to talk to me when I asked why the information wasn’t more clear on Alaskans website. She said “ there is nothing to discuss and with you.” She turned and mocked me to her employee in front of a group full of people and refused to give me any information on who above her I could speak with. She also said “it’s on me to do my diligence and it rarely happens to other people” even though the website gives you only half the information and is vague I believe on purpose. I was then told I needed to go get another test. The testing site is conveniently right outside the airport and $125.00 on top of that I will need transportation and to stay in a near by hotel without my things and has to rebook my flight for tomorrow. I’ve been told by someone who works for the company that these testing centers are giving 50% or the proceeds back to the airlines and I can only speculate near by hotels and transportation places are also giving a nice kick back or are at least benefiting from the dishonesty. Alaska Airlines during a time when people are struggling and situations are new I’m appalled with the way you’re manager spoke to me and the lack of compassion your employees have for people. You should really consider how you treat people and not just how you can put more money in your pocket and benefit from a pandemic where people are suffering. May I mention there are nearly 100 people in line right along with me so obviously I am not the only one.

### "Don't be rude to your frequent flyers"
I fell asleep before take off in my window seat. Towards end of flight I was asked to move a bag that had been in the same spot all of the flight. My bag was under my feet under the seat. I was told my bag was blocking the isle. How? I'm in a window seat. Why was it an issue suddenly. The flight attendants were rude even after placing the bag more so in the way, in front of my seat? (where I was asked to move it) That makes more sense! Lets move the bag to where it's more in the way, to where it's more of a tripping hazard. Don't be rude to your frequent flyers.

### "didn’t even give me my original seat"
Not Verified |  This airline is ridiculous. I checked in and chose a window seat specifically because it’s a 7 hour flight and they changed airplanes and didn’t even give me my original seat that I chose back. Also chose to be closer to the front of the plane because my last flight I was in the back and the bathroom stunk so bad and my new seat is all the way in the back. I also think it is ridiculous to not have snacks for every single passenger on board a 7 hour flight and tell them 10 minutes before boarding to go get something.

### "there are no available flights until 2 days from now"
Not Verified |  I purchased a ticket 1 month in advance and after spending over 1 grand in hotels, ubers and so on while about 40+ people including myself were at the airport waiting to board they tell us the flight was canceled and there are no available flights until 2 days from now! I lost a lot of money on this trip, horrible experience, will never fly Alaska Airlines again.

### "The customer service has been horrific"
Not Verified |  I do not plan to fly Alaska again. The customer service has been horrific. How is this the only industry where “customer service” employees are (as a norm) allowed to treat the customer horrible for no reason? As a business owner, I would be horrified by how the employees treat paying customers. They should hire secret shoppers to evaluate how they are treating people. I used to love flying but I have hated the past few flights this year. The mask nazis at the Seattle gate yelled at me for having my nose showing while I was speaking to another one at the desk. After I complied (I said nothing, just pulled it up), the lady got on the loud speaker and made an announcement while glaring at me while she said it. In addition to that, we were notified at 11.30pm last night that our flight was rerouted 2 hours the opposite direction of where we were going. It was not an easy morning finding that message at 3am when we woke up to leave. At the rerouted airport (Seattle) we were moved from our premium seats to the very last seats on the plane. Also, there are no options to purchase alcohol in the non-premium seats that we already paid for. It’s going to be a horrible 4 hour flight squeezed in a tiny seat next to a stranger (I was supposed to be next to my husband) who is overflowing their seat without a cocktail to chill out. And the mask Nazi’s on the plane keep coming around whenever it slips below my nose.

### "They are not a great company"
Not Verified |  They cancelled my flight an hour before departure and did not even send me an email at least before I get to the airport. This caused me to miss my international flight and had to pay for hotel and meals out of pocket and ruin my anniversary celebration and my daughter's graduation. They are not a great company. Do not waste your money or energy on them. If I could give them negative stars, I would have.

### "This has happened to me twice within 6 months time frame"
Alaskan Airlines offer direct flights from east-to-west coasts, but then, will completely eliminate these flights with 1-2 months ahead of time. They re-book you on a flight that takes twice as long (5 vs 10 hours in length), as the plane travels through 3 corners of the country. This has happened to me twice within 6 months time frame. As the notification of flight changes occur so close to the travel date, it is impossible to find a decent flight elsewhere. Most other airlines no longer have direct flights and the available 1-stop flights are expensive due to late booking. They offer to refund your money, but the time/effort/expense to book another flight is not accounted for. Covid has changed the way airlines do business, but this practice has caused me to re-consider ever flying with them again, despite the fact that I have been a loyal customer for years, and use their credit card for mileage points.

### "a good flight with Alaska"
It was a good flight with Alaska, although Drinks came near the end of the flight and my ears were hurting during landing. The flight seemed quick, mainly because I was watching Netflix on my device. I will go with Alaska Airlines again.

### "they decided to cram economy class together"
Not Verified |  Completely empty flight but they decided to cram economy class together in the back of the plane. I’m canceling my Alaska card and will never fly with them again.

### "said that the markings were wrong"
Not Verified |  On Monday morning (05/03/21) I checked my baggage in at Spokane International airport. Alaska Airlines (ASA) accepted my checked baggage and TSA screened and accepted my baggage for airline transportation. One of these items was a box of factory sealed ammunition that weighed approximately 25 pounds. My baggage was transferred to another ASA airplane in Seattle and transported to Juneau where I had a three hour layover after which I would board another ASA flight to my final destination in Sitka. During the boarding process in Sitka, I was called to the ASA customer service desk in the departure lounge. Once at the customer service desk a rather rude customer service agent informed me that my ammunition would not be allowed to travel to Sitka. When I asked why, she stated that the box (baggage) "had the wrong markings on it". When I inquired as to what the wrong markings were, she couldn't give me an answer, stating only that an airline baggage handler had said that the markings were wrong. I then assured her that I was well aware of FAA, TSA, and ASA regulations regarding the transportation of ammunition and that my baggage met all of those requirements. About that time she started to become very rude and, with a raised voice, informed me that my baggage didn't meet the requirements. I then asked her to explain to me how it was that both the TSA agents and the ASA customer service agents in Spokane cleared my ammunition for transportation on ASA earlier the same day. She defiantly stated that the people in Spokane were wrong. Following that comment, she stated that I needed to pull my face mask up over my nose, which had slipped down during our conversation. Since the municipality of Juneau owns the airport, it really wasn't her place to try and assert authority over my mask. When questioned further, she stated that I was welcome to exit security, repackage my ammunition and then check it in again for transportation with ASA. I stated that since the flight was already boarding and there was only one flight a day to my residence, that was not a feasible option. After I boarded the plane I placed a call to someone in Juneau to attempt to pick up my ammunition so at least the ASA baggage handler wouldn't get to keep it. The most logical conclusion I can come to is that someone at ASA in Juneau wanted my ammunition and timed the notification to me that it wouldn't be allowed on the flight so that I wouldn't have time to deal with retrieving it. It would be nice if Alaska Air would compensate me for my troubles and $1,000 loss but I won't hold my breath. If they don't I will go out of my way to give my business to small regional airlines and other major airlines, even if they cost more!

### "I'll never use you again"
I used to like Alaska, but after last weekend I'll never use it again! I flew on orders to serve my country and what I've got from Alaska is beyond any level of acceptance! I came to the airport 37 min before my flight (cut off for check in suppose to be 40) and they didn't let me in on my flight (I was flying with my toddler). They told me no and somehow that felt very personal and that I have to wait 3 hrs for the next flight! I told them I have to work the next morning, my kid was exhausted and they just mistreated me like I was nothing. Thank you for your service Alaska, I'll never use you again and I fly a lot!

### "Alaska has gone downhill"
They offer no food, unless you prepay for fruit and cheese 8.50, allergic to cheese, so not much of a choice. Then only 1 offer of beverage, no alcohol served unless in first class, isn't this discrimination against those that can't afford first class. Alaska has gone downhill, flight attendants seem a bit crabby and not overly pleasant to have their jobs. Will be looking for other airlines to fly in future! Paid 20.00 for wifi and was not that great, rip off!

### "I will fly other airlines from now on"
After flying from DC to Spokane with a layover in Seattle I was on my way back home to DC. After flying from Spokane to Seattle I had a horrible experience at gate N20 while waiting to board my final flight to DC. I had a employee who was working the gate tell me that my mask was unacceptable and she handed me a typical blue one. I put it on but mentioned to her that I had worn my mask from DC to Seattle to Spokane and then back to Seattle. She looked at me and asked "are you going to comply or not?". I said, pointing to my face "I already put the mask you gave me on". She raised her voice and asked again "are you going to comply or not?". I said again, "I already have the mask you gave me on" while I pointed to my face. This time she yelled, "are you going to comply or not, yes or no? I said "yes". I just wish you had a standard policy at all your counters and airports. Then she went and called a supervisor. Luckily, the supervisor had an ounce of common sense and left when she saw I was already wearing the mask that they had provided me. I have never had an employee at any establishment work so hard to start a fight. I will fly other airlines from now on.

### "Very professional in all aspects"
I wanted to say I'm grateful for the staff provided for me upon landing in Seattle on April 20 2021 from flight 201, my seat was 31F. I was unable to walk and your staff helped me with a isle seat and rolled me out of the plane where this wonderful angel was waiting for me to depart from the aircraft. Her name was Selam. She helped me a lot with processing customs and getting me to my vehicle in your garage. Her dedication and care for me was paramount. Very professional in all aspects. I am blessed to have run into her. If there was a way for me to reward your staff I would send it to her. It is with employees like Selam that drives your business. It make the whole world a better place to be in. Please send my praises to your CEO. and thanks again. Thank her for me please

### "The flight attendant woke me up 4 hours into the flight"
Not Verified |  The flight attendant woke me up 4 hours into the flight to tell me I didn't have the right mask and I have to wear a different one, she gave me one then came back every 10 minutes to check on my and give me hassle about not wearing it properly and I can't eat or drink and I get a final warning. I had earbuds in and didn't hear what she said till the "final warning" never use this airline.

### "never use your service again"
San Francisco to New York connecting to Moscow. I don’t recommend Alaska Airlines to anyone. They don’t care about their customers. Due to incompetency of their employees I couldn’t fly home and spend holiday time with my family. I bought non-refundable air ticket because I was flying to the country where I had citizenship and all citizens could enter the country without any restrictions. It was in the very end of December 2020. At the check-in an employee told me I couldn`t go because to enter the country I was going required COVID test. I it was not applicable to me because I have citizenship of that country. Then she called for another employee, they talked and this time they told me I couldn`t go because for the rules of their Alaska Airline to have COVID test to go on board. At the Alaska Airlines website there was no any information that anyone was required any test to go on board. And the first leg of the flight Alaska Airline was to perform was not international, it was from San-Francisco to New-York. I was to change the airline in New-York and proceed internationally. I can`t understand what was the ground for such decision from those employees and where they got this information they didn’t tell me. Sometimes I think they did it for fun. Or it was awful incompetency and irresponsibility. I lost $600 air ticket and Airbnb reservation. My plans to spend holidays with my family were ruined. I came home and wrote a letter Alaska Airlines customer service and asked them to send me the information where it stated that passengers had to have COVID test. They sent me a link where they suggested me to find out myself if I was eligible to fly without test. Following the link I received the information that test WAS NOT necessary for me. I sent them those results. I received apologies and $100 discount for the next travel with them. This is ridiculous, Alaska Airlines! Your employees are so incompetent and your customer service is insensitive and non-caring. I will never use your service again.

### "they over pack flights"
Alaska Airlines is a major hassle and don’t know know where to begin. First they over pack flights and make you check your bags and also they are putting complete strangers next to others. It’s funny I got hassled over my mask not being completely over my nose when I was outside walking to the plane.

### "Horrible flight"
Horrible flight, this was on our return home with Delta and Southwest which was wonderful and no issues. We flew with the same bags carry-on on the way to our destination and flying back we were forced to check our bags at the last min when we saw other people with similar size bags. I was harassed about my mask while walking outside of the airplane and not even in the airport over my mask not being completely over my nose. Told my wife not to book Alaska anymore, I will find another way.

### "Thanks Charlie for helping me"
Not Verified |  I have always had good experiences with Alaska Airlines. Recently, I called to inquire about potential changes to flights for an upcoming vacation. I was extremely lucky to end up working with Charlie from the Alaska Airlines Office in Boise, Idaho. Charlie worked with me for over an hour on the phone making all the changes needed until I was satisfied. He went through multiple options and was able to personalize my situation. He was professional, prompt, solution-oriented and focused on making me a continuing satisfied customer. Sadly, we don't see this level of customer service as often as we would all like. But good to know that it's alive well with Charlie in Boise and Alaska Airlines. Thanks Charlie for helping me and making me still believe in the quality of a company's mission.

### "I don’t think I can ever go back"
A sad day today for me. Wish I wasn’t writing this review. Been an Alaska flyer for years now. Have always loved it. Great prices. Great service. Today I don’t think I can ever go back. It’s a principle thing for me. Being a businessman, I highly value how a business treats a customer. We value our customers and put them first in EVERYTHING. Today had one of the most horrendous flights I’ve ever experienced. Halfway through my flight from Honolulu to LAX the flight attendant approached me as my mask was down after just finishing eating some snacks. As if from a hawk from her nest made sure to immediately address my mask being down and almost in a commond said “Put your mask on.” Not a please. Not a “hey sir, you’re our valued customer and you help pay my bills but we have to abide by the law, can you please put your mask on.” It was a “Put your mask on now and I’m not leaving til you do.” kind of a command. Disgusted, I put my mask up, only to find her on the prowl just 3 minutes later to see if I was abiding by her commands. My mask had fell down below my nose just a touch as it does normally when you chew and breathe and sleep on a plane. And she had no problem tapping me on the shoulder to say “Mask up above your nose now. This is your second warning and if I have to come back a 3rd time I will issue a warrant.” At this point I was baffled that humanity has swooped this low. I don’t care if it’s in a pandemic, or a national crisis, when I’m a paying customer there is some degree of customer service and generosity that is expected. No matter how small it might be. I don’t even need her to like me or even act like she likes me. But commanding me to take action like I’m an obedient dog awaiting orders was another level. I don’t even know what kind of warrant she was referring to, but she surely felt good letting me know she had the authority, power, and pride to do it. Just sad. For me, this is all it takes to have me completely switch over to a different airline and never consider Alaska again. Our family has been faithful members for decades flying first class with the miles that we’ve accumulated and Alaska has finally reached it’s lowest point. I wish it wasn’t just one flight attendant. Because an hour later, yet another attendant came over, tapped me to wake ME up, and asked if the man next to me was apart of our party. I told her no and she reached across me to shake the 70 year old man fast asleep next to me awake and said “SIR, you need to put your mask above your nose.” As if I was absolutely disgusted enough, I wanted to tell this lady off so bad. COVID has caused good people to completely throw all logic out the window and abandon good manners and any sense of politeness or respect. And it’s all in the “Name of the law.” Look, I get it. You have to follow laws. But why throw out your entire sense of manners and humanity? To top off the experience, the flight attended left me with a remark that was so loaded with sarcasm and sassiness it was sick.

### "stay away from this airline and their cruel attendants"
I had just had face surgery and was returning home. When boarding the plane with my mask on the flight attendant approached me and said my mask want tight enough. It a a disposable mask and was tight as it goes. She then calls the captain and security completely embarrassing me. The second flight attendant comes up and says I got this. Goes and grabs another mask and rips the strings. She then ties it as tight as it can go on my head touching my stitches and causing extreme pain. This bought me to tears and they left me like that the whole flight. Over a hour of pain. Definitely stay away from this airline and their cruel attendants.

### "Truly disappointing experience"
Biggest storm in decades and Alaska sat on their hands, made no attempt to resolve and cost me a day of sitting in an airport. I called in advance to proactively resolve this as the storm was forming. All other major airlines had started cancelling and routing people but Alaska waited and they would not work with me to get me to my destination before the storm. Then once tickets were cancelled they would do nothing but push back my ticket instead of getting me where I needed to be (in a diff state the following evening) plus no hotel or travel voucher to accommodate. Customer service reps are no help and just read from a script instead of actively trying to resolve anything. Truly disappointing experience that deserves no return business. Used to like Alaska so very unfortunate.

### "absolutely no social distancing in place"
Not Verified |  There is absolutely no social distancing in place. I am absolutely shocked - the plane was packed, they had strangers next to strangers. Good thing there isn’t an infectious airborne disease spreading around!

### "What a ripoff!"
Not Verified |  I have had the Alaska Air Visa for many years and had accumulated quite a few points. I scheduled a flight online and went back the next day to upgrade to 1st class with my points and was told there were no upgrade seats available, though the flight was still over three and a half months in the future. They finally relented and said that they would let me upgrade but that I would have to pay $209, that I had not selected the upgrade fare when I made the reservation. So the "upgrade fare" is $209 more! I have to pay $209 to use my points? What a ripoff! Get our credit card and get points, but you have to pay to use them"?

### "awful if you get stranded somewhere"
Not Verified |  This airline is awful if you get stranded somewhere. They cancelled all flight out of Texas for an entire week and did not give vouchers for anything. We were stuck in Texas and had to pay out of pocket for places to stay for an entire week. When I asked about vouchers they stayed that they do not do vouchers for weather issues. When I checked the weather the day before my trip the estimated low was only in the forties. I think that the airline should have helped out at least a bit with housing us during the storm. I would never recommend using this airline because they do so little to help you out when they strand you somewhere.

### "I would not take a free ticket from them at this point"
Mid Flight I realized something was dripping from the ceiling from where the seam of the airplane is. The flight attendant made everyone take their bags out of the overhead compartment thinking it was a water bottle leaking, it was not, it was coming out of the plane. They had no clue what to do. My hair and jacket were wet, they offered me nothing, not a napkin or a seat change. I moved myself to stay dry and in all the confusion left a bag under the seat in front of where I was sitting. I went to fill out the lost and found form today finding they charge $40 to fill out the lost and found form. I would not take a free ticket from them at this point. Worst experience ever!

### "Worst experience of my life"
Not Verified |  Worst experience of my life. I have always supported Alaska, but never again. On our Feb 13th flight to Orlando, it was nothing but a poor show. First, the flight was boarded on time. After around 45 minutes, they deplaned and claimed there were no pilots. Then why did you board the plane? I understand delays when there is winter weather, but it was pretty odd that they boarded anyway. The pilots then arrived about two hours late. Everyone cheered and they got ready to board! Not even 30 seconds later, the Alaska Airlines app notified us the flight was cancelled? My boyfriend ran to the counter to ask to switch to a new flight and asked “is our flight really cancelled?” The flight attendant said “what? I don’t think so?” They didn’t even know before it was announced? The pilots said they were ready to fly it. Then, everyone was frantic and running to the counter. We were told it was cancelled because the pilots were too late. Okay, fair enough. We were then booked on a flight days later that had a huge layover in San Diego. We took it upon ourselves to book a new flight that night on Delta. Flash forward one week, and one of our travelers with us had their Alaska Airlines flight home to Seattle cancelled without her knowledge because she was a “no show.” What? To add insult to injury, we had to spend more than $500 extra each to get to our destination, and they offered her a $100 voucher only and claimed the original flight was cancelled for weather when that was not what we were told, that’s suspicious. I got a $12 meal voucher that only could work on the random flight that they booked me on without my approval so really I got nothing. Never flying this airline again.

### "they are cheap and understaffed"
Tennessee to Anchorage flight. Waited for 2 hours to board the plane after it landed. It took them 1.5 hours to deplane the previous passengers. We didn't board until 40+ minutes after it was supposed to leave. They claimed they were delayed because of weather but said airline crew were taking a while loading our bags. The airline was full, no open middle seat for covid. We took off 3 hours after our expected departure time when the plane had arrived 2 hours before set departure. Almost all passengers missed connecting flights and had to stay the night in the airport. The Nashville crew said they would "take care of us" who missed our connecting flight. The Seattle Alaska Air customer service refused to pay for a hotel because delay was due to "weather" and said the Nashville team had no authority to tell us they would take care of us. The entire group of people presented the facts of the flight, clearly articulating this could not be a weather delay, but it didn't matter because it was what their "computer said. Additionally, due to being on the airplane for 6 hours I asked for a few extra small bottles of water and the stewardess asked me "How many people do you have in your party? Do you have three people? My impression of this airline is that they are cheap and understaffed (hence the baggage loading delay) and stuffing their planes to max capacity during covid. They require us to wear masks but aren't taking adequate precautions on their end. I will do everything in my power not to take this airline again.

### "What a waste of time, money, dignity, and livelihood"
Not Verified |  Currently trying to sleep on the floor of the Seattle International airport with no blankets, no food, and white fluorescent light everywhere wishing that this airline had a text reminder I can sign up for that reminds me to just luck the Delta flight that costs $20 more. What a waste of time, money, dignity, and livelihood.

### "greedy, selfish airline company"
I had booked a flight just before the pandemic, only for the pandemic to hit and eliminate all flights and travel. They only allowed a credit, which was frustrating but I knew I would use it because I fly for medical appointments. Well I tried using it a handful of times and they make it impossible. They don't offer any non-stop flights but I can find any ticket desired through another website for the same airline. And now the ticket is expiring, that's $300 thrown away to a greedy, selfish airline company.

### "No beverage or snack offered"
First leg was a red eye. No beverage or snack offered at departure nor in the morning before disembarking Seattle. There was sufficient time to offer at least water or make an announcement at Kona airport that you would not offer any food or beverages. This was a 5+ hour flight. Second leg SEA to RDU, on offer of beverage and a package of cookies, did not offer a second beverage service for a 5+ hour flight. I would have asked for two waters if I would have known. I used Clorox wipes to clean my area (Prem. Econ. ), wipe was dirty when I was finished. Makes me wonder if they did a good job cleaning the plan.

### "I have yet to be disappointed in regards to flights"
Not Verified |  Great flights and crews in each direction. I went to see my uncle who turned 90 on the eleventh. He had recently lost his wife and was alone. I told him I was coming down and would fly into Springfield, MO and drive from there. He agreed and was pleased that I made the effort. The flight down was a day flight which was unusual for me as I typically do a red eye however, I decided to split up the trip and stay at a nearby hotel in Seattle. I was up early, went through the TSA checkpoint in a somewhat timely manner and grabbed a cup of coffee at the Alaska Lounge. We departed on-time as has been the case with most of my Alaska flights. I sat next to a fellow who had been an F-4 jock back in the day and we spent much of the flight swapping war stories. The flight itself was fine, the crew was great, personable, professional and pleasant to deal with. We arrived on time. I then eventually found my AA flight to Springfield. Had a great time with my uncle, celebrating his 90 years. The return trips were great. I flew in First on three of the four Alaska legs and really had no complaints other than the breakfast meal I had pre-ordered was not available, I had the fruit and cheese choice which is fine with me anytime. Again, I landed in Seattle on-time and back to the hotel to break up the long day. Off to SEATAC the next morning and spent 3 hours at the Alaska Lounge watching the airport activity and drinking some great coffee. Our flight back up to Anchorage was great for me, the fellow next to me was not a happy camper though, he did not get what he ordered for breakfast and vowed never to fly Alaska again. I tried to tell him that things are different now thanks to Covid-19 and we all need to adjust a bit in regards to changes. He was not going to change his mind though. I guess I am just lucky in regards to my flights on Alaska. I read other trip reports on this forum giving very low ratings and I cannot believe what I am reading. I have yet to be disappointed in regards to flights, crew professionalism, on time arrivals etc. Yes, they could have more food in First I guess, but if that is your only worry be thankful, the folks in back don't get any. For me, I am pleased that they provide the services that they do in a safe and professional manner.

### "you think they would be more ready for cold weather"
For an airline called Alaska Airlines you think they would be more ready for cold weather. Especially since 100% snow was forecasted in Austin over a day before my flight. Regardless had to sit in the airplane for 3 hours to wait for them to defrost the plane. This was for a 4 hour flight.

### "would not give us our original seats"
Me and my family paid extra to have premium class in row 10 and 9. We reserved these spots many months before the actual flight and a week before our plane ride they separated me, my mom, and my 4 year old brother into separate rows far apart from each other. They told us we would have to wait until we get to the airport to change our seats. So we get to the airport and the guy at our gate was so beyond rude and would not give us our original seats we paid extra for. He was able to get our family together again since my little brother can’t sit in a seat by himself, however he put us in the very last row of the plane, row 32. I’m so beyond disappointed and mad at Alaska airplanes. They always change your seats even when you pay extra however this experience was the worst I’ve ever been threw. Highly suggest you chose a different airline than Alaska.

### "she clearly didn't want to help me"
I was on an aircraft that was delayed by a headwind and upon landing due to jet bridge problems. The stewardess continually said we were still early, even though we were not and my next flight was already boarding. When I asked what gate we came into and expressed concern for my connection, she said I booked them too close together. If that was the case, why did Alaska let me book a trip with an unmakeable connection? They hadn't and it wasn't. I made it by a hair after a sprint through the Seattle Airport. The stewardess on the first flight was extremely unhelpful and offered only a rude platitude to me as "help. They should know people have tight connections and should have offered me first off the flight, as I have seen before. Instead I had to rudely ignore covid deboarding protocol and sprint to the front, then off the flight to just barely make my next one. I originally was trying to have the stewardess notify my next flight that I was coming, but I never even bothered asking since she clearly didn't want to help me.

### "The service was mediocre"
We were delayed by about two hours, so instead of following the normal procedures everyone was shuffled on board at once, besides the disabled and gold mileage members. The seats were very thin and hard, although the recline angle was comfortable and the adjustable headrest was soft. Very little storage space in the seat back pocket, ended up putting my things on the empty seat besides me. There was also no coat hook, which is common on European airlines. The service was mediocre, there was only trail mix and your average drink options, although the attendant was kind enough to pour hot water into my own cup of noodles. There was no second service, however passengers were free to pick up drinks and snacks at the back. The wifi was slower than Delta, and the texting plan only worked half the time. There was no seat back screens, and entertainment was meant to be streamed from your own device. We paid 72 for the saver tariff, as well as 30 dollars per bag. The tickets were even cheaper than Spirit Airlines, which makes it definitely worth the value.

### "we will be back"
Our flight attendants truly made an exceptional trip for us! We had to cut our honeymoon short due to complications with flights. They were able to help make it a fun and memorable night, getting us safely home. This was our first time flying with Alaska and we will be back.

### "To say I was impressed would be a huge understatement"
Not Verified |  I flew out to RDU and back in First with Alaska. The flight down to SEA was a typical redeye departing around 1:30 am. The flight was fine overall a bit bumpy but that happens. A three hour layover at the Alaska lounge made it very enjoyable, grabbed some coffee and snacks. At the gate, I enjoyed talking with a young Coastguardsman and a couple from Sterling AK. Being the chatboy that I am, I did not notice that I left my carry-on bag at the seat. I did though when I got onboard and informed the attendant. She told me I could not deplane but would send someone to get it for me. Of all people, the pilot got off the plane and found it for me. I could not believe it actually. To say I was impressed would be a huge understatement. The two attendants were fantastic individuals who certainly put customer service first. Their attitudes were exceptional. I thanked them both for their care and consideration upon my departing the aircraft in Raleigh and told them to please thank the Pilot for me. This may have been the best Alaska flight I have ever taken!

### "Alaska ignores enforcement of their facemask policy onboard"
Not Verified |  Alaska ignores enforcement of their facemask policy onboard by allowing fliers to wear mouth covering only or not at all in this case for more than 60 minutes. Their policy allows removing briefly while eating or drinking and 60 mins is not briefly. Further the limited capacity, blocked middle or on smaller aircraft aisle advertising is a crock. They announce when you are close to boarding that some will have strangers seated next to you and if you don't like it they will rebook you, great...no other flights today. All this speak about concerned for our safety is just fake news. Who knows what other safety shortcuts are taken. Bye bye Alaska for American and Delta.

### "the middle seats were not empty"
Went on a trip to San Diego with my sisters. Bought the same flights as them, only to have my return flight changed from 9:30am to 6:15am. On our flight down to San Diego, the middle seats were not empty. I was in row with two strangers. And one of my sisters was in a row with two strangers. The flight attendants came on the speaker to say “This flight is overbooked. You may be sitting 3 to a row with people not in your family. If this makes you uncomfortable we will put you on the next flight out”. Given this, I called Alaska to ask that I be put back on the 9:30 flight, since they are booking out the middle seats, I could easily sit in one row with two of my sisters. To prevent others from sitting next to strangers. They wouldn’t do that. They would rather have my sisters sit on a flight three to a row, next to strangers, than next to their own sister, who paid to be on that Flight in the first place. I then asked to be changed to the 7:30 am flight so I wouldn’t have to fly out so early. They told me I would have to pay $50 to do that. But there are no change fees on Alaska Airlines, and this 7:30 flight was going for the SAME price I paid for my original ticket (keep in mind I paid in part for the ticket using miles so I couldn’t just cancel and rebook). They said that regardless, I would have to pay the $50 same day change fee.

### "lose even the most loyal customers"
Alaska Airlines has been going downhill over the last 5 years or so, but it is actually unbearable on this trip. First, I booked a flight LAX-PAE because I really wanted to fly into Paine Field; I figured it would be nice to come into a smaller airport while Washington State was in the beginning of Phase II reopening. Received a “looking forward to the flight” that included some “what to expect details” email 3 days prior to our flight. On the evening before our flight I log in to check in and get a pop-up to call customer service, or check in at the airport. Thank God, I had time to sit on hold for an hour, because that’s when I learned no Alaska flights were going into PAE. The CSR advised me numerous times we should have gotten an email. No matter how many times I said we had not, and in fact had gotten a confirmation instead. For the record, had we waiting to check in at the airport, we wouldn’t have gotten the 1 comparable flight that day. We rebooked BUR-SEA. As we walked on, they announced the back lav sink is broken, the WiFi is broken and the stewardess did a grumpy-dad-glovebox number on two of the overhead cabinets. So, now we’re sitting at the gate, an hour past take off time, waiting for a mechanic check on something else we didn’t even see or hear about. It’s not like they own the PNW market anymore ... sure feels like they want to lose even the most loyal customers.

### "What a waste of a day"
I asked if I could get an earlier flight a day ahead of time. They said I had to come in to the airport on the day of the flight and they would try to put me on an earlier flight. Now I am at the airport from 8 am to 4 pm on my regular flight. What a waste of a day. I wish I never would have asked.

### "kindness and professionalism"
Not Verified | I regret I didn't get any names, but all of the ladies working at the Alaskan airlines terminal in Kalispell Montana on August 11th and 12 th were amazing!! I was extremely disappointed that I wasn't able to go home as planned on the 11th due to aircraft troubles, but everybody was so accommodating and set me up with a room for the night, and meal vouchers for the next day. The ladies recognized me immediately when I came in the following morning and even asked me how my stay was. I was very impressed by the kindness and professionalism that everyone displayed.

### "asked to be refunded the difference in fare"
The flight experience itself was fine. However the customer service from their reservations/customer care departments was worthless. My flight was cancelled and consolidated to a different itinerary. When I had booked my flight I had considered the other itinerary, but chose a more expensive one because it was more convenient for my schedule. When my flight was rescheduled I asked to be refunded the difference in fare. It was only $31 difference per passenger, but it was still cheaper. They refused to refund me the difference in fare. If I had known I was going to have to fly the cheaper itinerary I would have booked that in the first place and saved myself the money. This may seem petty, arguing over $31, but it is the principle that matters, plus I had 7 travelers in my party, so it added up, when multiplied by all the members of my family. You would think Alaska would want to satisfy their customers, rather than infuriate them over $31. Next time I take a family trip I will take my $3,000 to another airline I can trust to make things right with their customers.

### "Alaska was so accommodating"
Had a credit from a canceled flight in June 2020 when the pandemic was in full force. We were worried that we would lose our $ and miles but Alaska was so accommodating and put the cash in our “wallet” and refunded the miles. Just flew down from SF to SD and even though it was a very few number of passengers, the airport and in flight team went above and beyond making us feel safe, explained all rules and regulations clearly and were pleasant and positive! I’ve always chosen Alaska and will continue to do so in the future. Please let the crew on my flight know they are doing amazing jobs considering the current circumstances.

### "not offered the additional features"
Not Verified | My wife and I paid additional fees for "Premium Seating" and was not offered the additional features that are listed to come with this feature. Premium Class is a product that is offered on select flights. Premium Class seats come with the following amenities: 4 inches of extra legroom Priority boarding Complimentary cocktails, hand-selected wine, and beer (where beverage service is normally served) We did not get priority boarding and did not receive any cocktails. We were served water and a limited choice of juice and soda. If this is the case, then why the additional charge? Remove the "complimentary cocktails" section out of the premium seating description. That is false information and misleading passengers in order to pay the additional fees.

### "not caring about the customer"
Not Verified | Due to Covid-19 my flight from Anchorage was changed which is understandable, a lot has had to change. However when I got to ANA I was told I did not have a seat on the flight they changed my earlier flight to. I had a seat on my connecting flight in Seattle but flight AS106 out of Anchorage was full, without me, even though they were the ones that changed my flight. So they booked me on yet another flight, 3 hrs later. I was told to check at the gate if there was a no show on the earlier flight (AS106) if so I could get on. Well there was a seat available, but the young man at the gate would not let me have the seat. So the plane left with an empty seat and I had to wait another 3 hours for the next flight. This is some of the worst customer service I have very experienced. I do understand that there are problems brought on by covid but this was brought on by people not caring about the customer. It only gets worse. I just received a text telling me AS106 is delayed by 25 minutes. Why am I getting a text if I am not suppose to be on that flight?

### "avoid Alaska Airlines"
Not Verified | Worst airline in the past 10 years! I understand that these times are difficult for everyone. My flight was changed by the airlines at least 7 times by the airlines in a 2 month period. I get it. The problem was that I was never contacted by the airlines to see how these changes worked with my schedule. There were 5 people traveling together to a remote Alaskan fishing lodge with a tight schedule and limited access to this isolated facility. These changes were never communicated to me or asked which option benefited me rather than the airline random movement. I had also misplaced my driver’s license upon arrival in Seattle for a long layover before continuing to my final destination. I contacted TSA to make I would have the needed material for departure and satisfied them. When I contacted Alaskan to make sure we were good, I was told it would be an additional $200 expense since they had to add two additional sentences to my ticket. This is only a chance to grab more money. I refused to pay and ultimately got on the plane. This was nothing more than an attempt by Alaska Airline to “stick it” to their clients when it was not even necessary. On the return home flight, we had a 45 minute lay over in Seattle between connections. We landed on time and could not get the gate because a plane was at the gate. We let the flight attendant know that we had 5 people making a tight connection and another party of 15 was also trying to make a tight connection to Sacramento. Once we made it off the plane and to a neighboring gate, the Alaska Airlines flight was at the gate and not pulled away. They refused to let us on our flight and would not let us speak to a supervisor. The other group had the flight held for them and made their connection. There was never any effort by Alaskan to provide services to their clients, but rather they did what benefited the airlines only. Custom service, I felt is not a priority for Alaska Airlines. I will go out of my way to avoid Alaska Airlines and suggest anyone else that is booking, BEWARE!

### "the rest of the crew was top notch as well"
Not Verified |  First off let me say that, in my opinion, Alaska is trying hard during these unusual times. My route changed from BWI direct to SEA to PIT then on to SEA. This was not a big deal as we landed, a few folks got off and a few got on. The flight was only about 45 minutes and we were on the ground less than 20. The crew told us to please wear your masks at all times except when eating or drinking and everyone complied. I was moved up to First, one row in front of where I had been sitting. The service was fine but the "food" left a lot to be desired. It was some sort of small box with not much in the way of food inside. As I recall there were chips, crackers, smoked creamy cheese and small salami pieces within. I managed to eat it all but did enjoy the wine with it. The First Class FA made the trip very enjoyable. After serving everyone, she came and sat with me for a little while and we shared our love of aviation over the years. From what I saw, the rest of the crew was top notch as well. The pilots got us to SEA a little early and I then relaxed in the Alaska Lounge for two hours before catching the flight home to ANC. No problems noted as that crew was professional and we were well cared for. All in all, I still enjoy this airline and eventually when all these troubles are over, it will then be able to provide their old, reliable level of service which they were known for. I do look forward to that.

### "profits over customer safety"
Most of us appreciate the fact that during this pandemic we live with uncertainty and risk. I accept this, but take reasonable precautions to stay safe. With this in mind I choose Alaska for a recent flight from Portland to Orange County. My risk analysis was heavily influenced by the airline’s stated policy that passengers would be seated with an open seat next them, thereby significantly reducing the density of people, and creating more space between passengers. Separate seats were booked for myself and three other family members. We were all a bit nervous about the prospect of being in a confined space with strangers during Covid times, but took solace in the promise that the airline had a safety policy of spacing people and reducing overall passenger density. I calculated that my family’s “bubble” would be a space of four rows (the plane has two seats per row). We’d each have the option of sitting adjacent to the window, with an empty seat between us and the aisle. Imagine my disappointment when the boarding agent scanned my ticket and informed me that our seats were changed. Alaska had unilaterally decided that we were a group that must be packed in side by side. This was the case for many other travelers on this plane. Mandatory reseating. End result: a very full plane, zero personal space for those sitting in the aisle, more people impacting the restroom, more people in line, more hands on the fixtures, more risk for my family. And one more thing: more profit for Alaska Airlines. My decision to take this flight was a calculated risk. I weighed the facts based on what I thought was an honest agreement between me and the airlines regarding personal space and overall airplane density. I feel duped. When boarding, I told the agent we do not want to be reseated in a tighter cluster. The response: “sorry sir, we need to make room for more people”. Thank you Alaska for reorienting me on your company’s policy: profits over customer safety. I appreciate that airlines are struggling more than most businesses to financially survive the COVID crisis. But I do not appreciate being mislead. Airlines have a responsibility for their customer’s safety, and a moral responsibility to honest and transparent when communicating their policies. Alaska Airlines has lost my trust.

### "been at the airport all day"
For a long time i enjoyed flying on Alaska, as a military member they always came through for me and got to the point that is all i fly. However on this current trip, I am wondering how in the heck they are still in operation. To start my flight from sac to sea was changed then my returning flight was changed to the time i specifically told the agent on the phone would not work, after a 24+ hold, (they did call back) i was able to get it changed. Come the day of travel my flights both from my original starting point and my layover kept getting moved back! Alaska figure it out, total flight time is under 2 hours yet, I have been at the airport all day.

### "Wouldn’t want to book with Alaska again"
July 1st, I got to the airport an hour and a half before my flight. Couldn’t Check-in at the kiosk because my reservation wasn’t found, it said to talk to an agent. No agent was available until an hour later. Calling customer service was a 2-3 hours wait, texting is 40 minutes wait and the agent wasn’t very helpful. My flight was completely cancelled, as in it doesn’t exist anymore and they couldn’t find any flight for me until July 3rd. I needed to be in Austin ASAP for a wedding, can’t wait 2 days later. The next best thing was to leave from San Francisco airport, 2 hours away, the next day. It was horrible, no notice of flight cancellation, no compensation for all the trouble. Reading the reviews, this seems a regular occurrence. Wouldn’t want to book with Alaska again.

### "do not care about your time"
I originally booked a flight from Sacramento to Austin with a connecting flight Seattle weeks ago. A couple days before my flight they had changed my departure time for Sacramento to after 12 pm to 8:05 am. This is a huge inconvenience because I have to drive 2 and a half hours to the airport. After calling them to try to work something out they said there was absolutely nothing they could do to help me. No later times available. No hotel room for the night before. I had to wait over an hour and a half to talk to them and was on the phone for over 2 hours with them (90% of the time on hold). I'm very patient, I understand things happen. This on the other hand is completely ridiculous. Not professional. My 9 hour trip is stretched 4 more hours. They obviously do not care about your time. Just their own profit. This is not how you treat customers or for that matter a human being. Never have ive seen so little care in a company. They should be ashamed to call them self an airline.

### "canceled the flight 5 days ago"
I had a ticket booked with Alaska for a few weeks. I checked on the way to the airport with Alaska and my flight was on time. Get to airport and am unable to check in. No one is around and the kiosk keeps letting me get through the entire process but won't print my tickets and prompts me to check in with the desk. Again, no one at the desk. I call and they tell me they canceled the flight 5 days ago. No one emailed me or called me or update their info online. I had to book a ticket with another airline while standing in the airport. I paid 900 dollars for a 400 flight because is was same day. Thanks so much. You wowed me.

### "It was a good flight"
Seattle to Columbus. It was a good flight. The flight attendants were not the nicest. They were just demanding, not being kind. The seats were really nice. It was the refurbished A320 so it was especially nice. Legroom was amazing. Overall, I would rate it a 87/100.

### "Definitely never flying Alaska again"
Orlando to Anchorage via Seattle. I booked a flight and purchased first class upgrade when I checked out. A week before I travel, I get called and told I’m on a different flight, but that my seat is still in first class. Apparently, I was bumped to “premium class” without knowing it. When I approach the counter they say “sorry” we have no record of you purchasing a first class seat. Then they promised me a beer on the plane - I don’t drink. I call customer service and they tell me I’m definitely in first class and “not to worry”, that it was a computer snafu. But on the plane they jam me into the back. Definitely never flying Alaska again.

### "No customer service"
Not Verified |  Alaska airlines is a joke. No customer service and they tell you that you are screwed. They take your money and refuse to give it back. We purchased tickets for an event and due to Covid was canceled. They gave us a credit even though we bought the insurance to cancel. Told us that’s all they would do and that it was illegal for me to sell my credit because I would never want to fly their airline.

### "legroom and seat comfort was great"
The aircraft was a bit small but the legroom and seat comfort was great for a domestic flight. Although there wasn’t an on-air meal, the crew checked up regularly if we needed anything like water of snacks. There is 1-hour of free WiFi (if you have T-mobile) as well as unlimited texting data. There was also movies and podcasts on the on-flight entertainment. The only downside is the ground staff as they were rude and slow.

### "keeping my money"
Not Verified |  Do not book with this greedy, cold-hearted airline. I found myself like so many having to cancel all travel plans due to COVID-19. My Alaska Airlines flight was to be an internal flight from Orange County to San Francisco in May 2020 . My main flight from Australia to USA was with Singapore Airlines. After making contact with Singapore Airlines and all my accommodation providers throughout the USA, I received a refund from everyone. Alaska Airlines is the only company who are keeping my money. I have tried several times to request a refund (I was happy even to pay a cancellation fee) however each time I am met with a strong NO. Shame on you Alaska Airlines!

### "Alaska Airlines - nada"
Not Verified |  Our June Cruise got cancelled due to the virus and Alaska Airlines is refusing to give us a refund on our tickets but we can get a credit that we have to use within a year which we probably won't use! Seattle Bed and Breakfast - full refund, no questions asked. Fox Rental Car Company - full refund, no questions asked. Amtrak - full Refund, no questions asked. Hampton Inn - full refund, no questions asked. Princess Cruises - full refund, no questions asked. Various Cruise Excursions - full refund, no questions asked. Alaska Airlines - nada. Nope. Sorry. Maybe your flight will be cancelled and then we can refund you. Maybe. Alaska Airlines claims to have amazing customer service and focus, we are hoping to see it. Would not recommend this airline to anyone!

### "have lost a customer for life"
Alaska airlines gives disgruntled passengers air miles for lost luggage, an unsatisfying experience and a plethora of other reasons - am I right? They use air miles as a retention tool, because giving a passenger air miles doesn't monetarily cost them anything. I recently used 160,000 air miles - which I earned with my butt in an Alaska Airline seat - to travel to Spain in May 2020. Although the hotels were non-refundable, I purchased a travel protection program, which informed me my miles would be refundable should I not be able to travel due to a health related issue. Then, COVID-19 hit. Delta airlines, with whom I had non-refundable tickets - issued me a full monetary refund. Two hotels in Spain, for which I had non-refundable reservations, refunded me. Alaska Airlines has refused. The only refund I requested of Alaska Airlines is the air miles I used to "purchase" the hotels. When you use air miles for hotels, you also have to spend a very small portion of money, which I did, and which I did not ask for a refund. I was willing to lose the $500 dollars, but not my air miles. What has been the answer of Alaska Airlines? I'm sorry Sir, there is nothing we can do. What I now believe is that Alaska Airlines cares more about their short-term pain than the longer term gain of ensuring client retention. Alaska Airlines might have kept the 160,000 air miles that I used to purchase my hotel stays, but they have lost a customer for life.

### "a lousy way to do business"
Not Verified |  On March 2, 2020 I bought tickets for two people to fly to Burbank, CA from Seattle, WA for June 2020. The purpose of the flight was to attend a wedding in Burbank for my sister. When the nation got put on lock down status in mid March due to the pandemic the wedding was postponed because the caterers and wedding location wanted a non-refundable deposit and there was no way of knowing if events of more than ten people were going to take place. I called the airline and explained to them that I needed to cancel the flight due to no fault of my own, as a result of the pandemic. There response was that they would give me a 50% credit toward a later flight, and I would be penalized 50% for canceling my flight. Plus they indicated that I should have known by December 2019 that there was going to be a pandemic, and it was my fault for booking a flight. When I tried talking to a representative she stated that she could not answer any questions and to take it up with the travel insurance company. I also had travel insurance through Alaska airlines. I sent in a claim with them to be reimbursed. They responded back saying I wouldn't be covered because epidemics weren't covered. What a lousy way to do business. My wife and I are retired and we travel a lot, but not with this airline ever again.

### "they can issue me a credit"
Not Verified |  Thanks to Coronavirus-19 Our trip has been canceled. While trying to get my money back all the people with Alaska can tell me is that they can issue me a credit to fly with them at a later date. The flight has not been canceled, but the plane flight number and time has been changed, but not an hour's difference. It has changed one time by 10 minutes and then another time by 40 minutes. It has been underneath an hour so it does not qualify. Alaska's flight routs and schedules do not work with what My wife and I need to book. When you try to send an email no one from Alaska gets back in touch with me.

### "Shame on you Alaska Airlines"
I am writing a review regarding a future flight in September 2020. I was scheduled for a cruise from Whittier Alaska to Vancouver Canada on Sept 12 2020. I received notification from the cruise line yesterday the trip was cancelled. I want to cancel my flights, no problem, but the airline wants to charge me $125 cancellation fee and credit the reminder for a future flight. Not only that, the airline will not give credit or refund for purchasing premium economy seats. With what is happening today and the airline not working with the customer is a real issue. Shame on you Alaska Airlines.

### "Worst customer service"
Not Verified |  Worst customer service out there right now. While everyone is refunding customers, this joke of a company, who is receiving billions in bail out money won’t take care of the American people. Fly Delta or other companies who are putting people 1st.

### "a credit towards a future flight"
We booked flights back at the beginning of February 2020 to fly the first week of April 2020 to Alaska. Then COVID-19 turned into a huge issue. We cancelled these flights at the beginning of March 2020. These were booked as non-refundable flights. Since Alaska enacted a policy in March 25th, 2020 that all visitors to Alaska have to self-quarantine for 14 days if they come to Alaska, I called Alaska Air to see if there was any option for a refund and was told absolutely not. I can have a credit towards a future flight. Great, when the economy is the toilet and my husband was laid off, we can rest assured that at least we can book our vacation later in the year. I understand policy under normal times but with everything going on, we are more interested in paying our mortgage than we are in taking a vacation anytime soon.

### "Won’t fly this airline again"
Dallas to Seattle. Alaska Airlines is charging to cancel flights related to coronavirus. This is not customer service. Won’t fly this airline again. $125 to cancel the flight - each. I can’t believe that this airline is this uncaring.

### "will not refund our money"
Not Verified |  Salt Lake City to Seattle. Buyer beware! We had a cruise cancel because of the Coronavirus, Alaska Air will not refund our money - this just stinks! With the economy in the condition it is every penny counts. I highly doubt I will ever fly Alaska Air again.

### "Shame on you Alaska Airlines"
Salt Lake City to Honolulu via San Fransisco. The governor of Hawaii closed the state to incoming tourists. We had purchased airfare through Alaska Airlines in December for our 6-person family as a Christmas present. Alaska Air became the scrooge by not refunding our airfare while at the same time benefiting from a $50 billion bailout from the federal government - meaning our taxes! So, they take our personal money and then our tax money. Shame on you Alaska Airlines

### "will not refund our flight"
Not Verified |  We will not being flying Alaska ever again. I was trying to take my daughter on her first ever vacation for her 22nd birthday and could not have predicted a pandemic. They will not refund our flight AND made us pay $250 dollars to credit our account and not lose the price of the tickets. Poor customer service. A very trash way to treat their customer base during this difficult time. I hope they learn from this because I will never support their business again.

### "need to get their morals straight"
Not Verified |  Anchorage to Phoenix. I will never fly Alaska Airlines again, after I use my “credited" tickets. My husband and I booked tickets to our nephews graduation in May. We have both lost our jobs due to the corona virus and my husband has an autoimmune disorder and should not be out flying. We did not know things were getting cancelled when we booked our tickets. We have no other reason to use these tickets and could really use the $2,600 that we paid for the tickets. I have always only flown Alaska and use their credit cards for everything. I would rather pay extra at another airline than to fly with an airline that need to get their morals straight.

### "refused to refund the flight"
Oakland to Eugene via Seattle. I had to cancel my flight because the family member I was visiting in Oregon is in hospice at an assisted living facility and residents of Alameda county were instructed to shelter in place. Alaska refused to refund the flight. Even worse, the "supervisor" was rude, lacking any compassion or even humanity. All she cared about was making money for Alaska. It was a disgusting interaction.

### "how poorly they are cleaning"
Not Verified |  Kauai to Spokane. With Coronavirus, Alaska is saying how they are cleaning and disinfecting extra well which is completely incorrect (see picture). Upon wiping down a few seats/trays with my Lysol wipes, the wipe turned black. Given the current pandemic, this is ridiculous and unacceptable. In general we love Alaska but during these times I would not recommend them for how poorly they are cleaning flights.

### "will not refund"
Not Verified |  We had booked a flight for May 9th from Salt Lake City, UT to Vancouver and a return from Anchorage, AK to Salt Lake City, UT on May 16th. We were planning on going on a Princess Cruise, but the cruise has been cancelled due to the Corona virus. Alaska Airlines will not refund or even give us future credit for a flight. Since Corona virus is a national pandemic and flights are being shut down we do not want to travel out of the country for our own safety. We have called them multiple times and they won't do anything for us. We have had to wait on hold for hours at a time just to be told rudely they won't work for us.

### "able to do it right online"
Not Verified |  Seattle to New York. I am not sure the people having issues canceling and getting credit for their flight due to the coronavirus. I was able to do it right online. I had called a few days earlier when I was thinking about it, and the lady on the phone was very nice and helpful. I have flown with Alaska many times, and I plan to continue to fly with them when all goes back to normal!

### "This airline has no compassion"
Las Vegas to San Francisco. My 81 year old mother and her 88 year old sister bought tickets for a baby shower to welcome a great grand baby. Because of the Corona virus, they are afraid to travel at this date. I called and asked for a credit, not a refund, just a credit so they could travel at a later date after the virus was better handled for the elderly. I was told no credit, no refund! The airline will keep their $400.00 if they do not use the ticket. But the ticket is not transferable either. This airline has no compassion! I will not be using Alaska Air in the future. This flight is not leaving for 5 more weeks, that is plenty of time for the airline to resale the tickets. Unbelievable!

### "called up to cancel my flight"
Not Verified |  I called up to cancel my flight. I have had a cold after traveling overseas and thought it would be best not fly due to the danger to other passengers. Employee told me they could not offer me a refund and if I wanted to fly sick that was up to me. I asked for a supervisor and she said flying sick was not an issue for them and she could not offer a voucher or a refund. No temperature screening at gate, no problem with someone coughing. Apparently any sickness is tolerated.

### "We are so grateful"
Not Verified |  Seattle to Vegas. We accidentally reserved our flights wrong and Deanna  and Adrian helped us out tremendously. We are so grateful they were amazing and truly blessings. Thank you guys so much

### "I had to cancel that ticket"
Alaska airline has to take the crown for worst customer service , had a flight from Seattle to Dallas got to the gate 3 minutes late (it was my fault ) lady at the gate was so rude and uncouth kept saying you can’t go even if the plane is still outside I said okay fine. I gotta be at work please put me on another flight or a connecting one she kept saying there’s none at (6am in the morning I was at the airport ) she said till the next day that unless I went to find another flight. I said it’s 6am at least there should be one connecting flight she said no. I had to cancel that ticket that was expensive and had to book a new one on Priceline immediately and I got stupid Alaska airline again same day, the same flight that customer service said wasn’t running that day.

### "they wouldn’t work with us"
Not Verified |  Las Vegas to San Francisco. They charged us a change fee that basically more then our ticket. We just need to move up our flight and they wouldn’t work with us what so ever. This is so ridiculous and the recent cases of coronavirus should be taken in to account of changed flights or medical emergencies.

### "I called for a refund"
I am scheduled to fly to SeaTac next week. Due to the Corona Virus outbreak I called for a refund. Alaska Air will not refund my ticket despite my not being able to travel because of an "underlying compromised immune system issue". They said the CDC said people can travel safely. I pointed out that the CDC statement was unless you have a compromised immune system. Rather than refund $300+, they put a credit in my account and waived the change fee. How big of them! My travel is into Seattle right in the heart of the breakout, an area that has been declared a national disaster state. I can appreciate the airlines losing money.

### "accidentally canceled my booking"
Not Verified |  Columbus to Seattle. Made an error on my phone that accidentally canceled my booking which was still 10 days in the future. Called customer service a couple times, and they refused to help. No consideration, nothing. They mocked me by saying you are welcome to buy a new ticket. Really? Does this a few hundred dollars out of customer's mistake really can help the business? Very disappointed, and Alaska airline just lost another customer.

### "I give up on you Alaska"
Not Verified | Orlando to Seattle. I have been traveling globally my entire life and being from Seattle have always loved all things Alaska Air. I often try to fly premium economy for comfort reasons but today I am forced to fly economy due to availability at the time of purchase for my business travel. The distance that Alaska has pushed the seat rows to is ridiculous! I am 5’6 and my knees are hitting the seat in front of me and that was before the passenger ahead of me reclined. I have a 6-hour flight crunched so tight this cannot be medically responsible. I am not flying Alaska in the future. I never have written a review before but it seems appropriate considering the liberty you have taken in your lack of consideration for the even mild comfort of your passengers. As a general public, I suppose we are forced to tolerate this profit only focused attitude. Fortunately, I do have choices and I’m sad to say I give up on you Alaska.

### "Horrendous service"
Seattle to San Jose. Horrendous service. They did not even attempt to seat my husband and I together. Absolutely rude, unprofessional and lazy. If I have the choice I will not fly with them again.

### "had a mix up with my flight"
Not Verified |  Seattle to Sacramento. Worst experience I’ve ever had! I had a mix up with my flight and the customer service did nothing to help me. Nor did they offer to compromise with me. So unprofessional and inconsiderate. Lost thousands of dollars due to their unwillingness to help. Very disappointed in Alaska airlines and will definitely be flying with another airline when traveling.

### "gone downhill in the last few years"
Seattle to Santa Barbara. Used to be my favorite airline, but has gone downhill in the last few years. Previously, I've always been able to reserve my seat when I purchase a ticket for no extra charge. Now, like other major airlines, Alaska has jumped on the "charge for anything that makes flying slightly less miserable" train. If you purchase a base fair, you can select a seat, but the fine print says you are not guaranteed it. Which means they give it away to someone with more money, and you now have to wait for an agent at the gate and get assigned a seat. The gate agents show up about 10 minutes before you're supposed to board, and you are always put in the very last row. Most likely the middle seat. If they weren't the only airline that flies direct, I'd ditch them and go with one of the other ones that's at least up front about these charges.

### "lack of compassion and professionalism"
I am truly outraged at the lack of compassion and professionalism  during my flight home on February 2, 2020 from Phoenix to Anchorage. When my husband booked our flights he called Alaska Airlines and followed their directions of booking us together on all flights and booking a different flight when he advised he would have to fly to Dallas from Phoenix. When we checked in, about three hours early and had the attention of the counter agent, who we advised my husband was not flying with me on our companion airfare. The agent said, “That was not a problem as we had paid for both seats.” As I was in boot casts on both feet, and having to use crutches to walk, the agent gave my husband a boarding pass telling him that way he could escort me to the gate helping with my carry-on. he also gave my husband directions to board Spirit Airlines which was located in a different terminal. After boarding the flight, which was quite a challenge being in the condition I was in, and the doors closed and ready for takeoff, I was approached and made to feel like I was some kind of thief and forced to leave the flight. I was told that because I was not the primary flyer on the companion airfare I could not continue on the flight as my husband was not with me. I explained that the companion airfare was from the same credit card I was an account holder on. I was told I was going to have to buy a full fare ticket, to which I asked to buy the seat I was sitting in and not be removed from the flight. I was told that was not going to happen and I had to get up and leave this flight and I would not be flying on this plane. I was forced to de-board in Phoenix, from a direct flight to Anchorage, with a long layover with no offer of assistance. I cannot explain how vulnerable, alone, and at risk I felt during that six hours before I could board another flight, which I paid for with the same credit card the companion airfare was purchased on. Then I had to deboard and navigate the Seattle airport for a long layover, on crutches, with a heavy carry-on, with no offer of assistance to or from the gate. I was told on flight 115, before I was forced to deboard, that I had to be the primary flyer, and since been told the same. Why didn’t the individual my husband talked to when he called and booked the flights tell him the same, why didn’t the agent advise the change when we checked in? Why was I not allowed to purchase my seat on flight 115? My husband booked his return flight to Anchorage from Dallas on Alaska Airlines, and he just purchased tickets in March to Phoenix on Alaska Airlines. Alaska Airlines has almost exclusively been our airline of choice as noted by the almost 600K airlines miles we have on our credit card. So many opportunities for Alaska Airlines to be compassionate and to have put yourself in my shoes and help, but the agent that removed me from the flight was very short with me, rude in how she spoke with me, and would not listen or work with me at all. Please tell me this is out of the ordinary situation and this is not the level of customer service at Alaska Airlines.

### "flight would be delayed again"
Seattle to Oklahoma City. Checkin at Pullman was a joke. I had to spell out my last name 5 times because the customer service staff couldn't spell it right. Meaning she claimed I wasn't on any flight for today. Flight from Pullman to Seattle was delayed, but at least my flight wasn't for another four hours. Turbulance most of the way, and flight attendants weren't really attentive. When it came time to begin boarding my connecting flight to OKC, there were no customer service agents present at the gate of departure. Everyone who was supposed to be on that flight began questioning what was going on until someone finally decided to show up 40min later and say the flight was delayed due to mechanical issues. And we didn't get any other indication about boarding for at least another hour. When the customer service agent came on again, it was to announce the flight was delayed again. He didn't give a reason this time. 3hrs after our scheduled departure, we were finally allowed to board. But once on board, the pilot came on and said the flight would be delayed again due to slow ground handling staff. We didn't depart until 4hrs after our scheduled departure. I've given Alaska more chances than I should've, and this was the last time I will ever fly this airline.

### "enjoyable to fly"
Not Verified | Anchorage to Dallas via Portland. Departed Anchorage at 0100 Sunday night and arrived around 0500 in Portland. This flight was great as was the customer service. The wine and cheese plate was fine as was the glass of white wine. I enjoyed my time looking out the window and very glad that I was not lost in the mountains we were flying over. After arriving in Portland I went to the Alaska Lounge, grabbed some toast and coffee and waited for my DAL flight. I was looking forward to this flight as I have never flown on the E-175 and have never been to Love Field in Dallas. The flight was done by Horizon and I was impressed. Their work ethic, customer service and great attitudes was up there with the Alaska crews I have dealt with over the years. The aircraft was enjoyable to fly in, comfortable, clean and fast. Landed in DAL a few minutes early. I was more than pleased to have been spoiled by Alaska/Horizon!

### "Buyer beware"
Not Verified |  Santa Rosa to Eugene. Leaving 3 hours late and they finally managed to apologize for the delay! They admit to being too understaffed to commit to the schedule they sold tickets for. Buyer beware.

### "Very bad experience"
I went San Francisco to Seattle return flight. I got mail from Alaska 6 hours before time has been changed 2 hr move forward. my plans everything changed. Very bad experience with flight and return also changed timings every 15 mins,  5:35 PM to 9:05PM. No courtesy to inform passengers.

### "Give them a miss"
Austin to San Francisco. Seats are basic as is the service, I’d hate to see what economy is like. The floor is sticky and everything looks dirty. The food and beverage service is nothing worth mentioning as well. Did I mention no inflight TVs? Give them a miss.

### "nobody gave a darn"
We’ve been with American Airlines for over a decade but we had enough, by chance we tried Alaskan. Big mistake, these guys must be the only airline worse than AA. We sat on the ground so long we were sitting on our first flight while our next flight was already boarding and we were to have a 1 hour+ layover. Then we cannot get a terminal because? So we had to pack an entire packed plane onto 1 single bus. Then we have to run nearly 2/3rds of the airport to get to the end of C. Then we finally get on our plane, only because the reader boards are wrong and people are not coming to the correct gate. So now our 8.30 flight to Boise is still sitting on the gate at 9.51. Best part is, nobody gave a darn. Not one employee is in any way apologetic or understanding of how they are ruining our travel.

### "disappointing and unapologetic"
Seattle to Oakland. Alaska Airlines has been very basic and unimpressive until today. Today it was just disappointing and unapologetic. Poorly educated employees with no explanation for their bad customer service. I fly 40/50% of the year with top airlines and Alaska is by far one of the most disappointing experiences every time. Moving back my seats 10 to 20 rows at times - not to mention never being friendly or informative. Do not fly Alaska if you want a positive experience. I will go out of my way to avoid this airline moving forward.

### "Flight keeps getting delayed"
Seattle to Kalispell. So frustrating! Flight keeps getting delayed 10 minute increments at a time. All due to no flight attendants. Seems like they would have a plan / staff to tend to the flights. They’ve been telling us to remain in the flight terminal because we’ll ‘leave shortly’. I’m starving and not much food options around here. Been waiting for over 2 hours now. If you want a reliable airline please avoid Alaska Air. Also every announcement is about another flight delay with Alaska Air! !

### "denied access to my flight"
Not Verified |  Indianapolis to Spokane. Was denied access to my flight because it was delayed and hour and 15 minutes and didn’t show up till an hour before my flight. Was told they were closed and they weren’t checking bags anymore. She then told me that when my flight is delayed I’m still expected to show up an hour before the time my flight was supposed to be there... so TWO hours before my flight, with two kids under the age of five? If that was their policy they should have texted me that too when they texted me saying my flight was delayed! Missed my flight and therefore missed a very important day of school but I guess it’s my fault for flying Alaska... never again!! !

### "Flight delayed 3 times"
Seattle to Omaha. Very disappointing. Flight delayed 3 times with no explanation given. Then, sat on the plane waiting for luggage to be loaded another 45min. Weather perfectly fine in both locations. Missing work because of these delays

### "one of the better US-based airlines"
Honolulu to Dallas/Fort Worth via Seattle. While US-based airlines often lag behind their international counterparts in terms of providing modern amenities and efficient and pleasant customer service, it has been my experience that Alaska is one of the better US-based airlines. I've flown them over the last five years and always have had positive experiences. Their economy seats aren't exactly luxurious, but their planes have always been extremely clean. Their flights, sans their puddle-jumper ones, usually have a great assortment of on-flight entertainment. Staff, whether at check-in, the gate, or on the plane, are almost always pleasant, courteous, helpful, and professional. The only exception was the gruff and rather odd check-in agent in Honolulu (no surprise, it's a terrible airport with miserable staff) who was skeptical about accepting my checked bag because of something on my boarding pass that he couldn't really articulate, but, nevertheless, he demanded to see my driver's license. I have no idea what that was all about and what his problem was, since I entered my name, address and TSA Pre-Check details correctly when I booked the flight. Otherwise, the check-in processes, whether online or at the airport, are normally efficient. The one time I was delayed on Alaska, about three years ago, the staff handled passenger inquiries with class and professionalism - much more so than I would expect on airlines such as United, American, Spirit, and Southwest. Their prices are often competitive with the likes of United and Southwest, especially for West Coast flights. It's a shame that Alaska focuses primarily on the West Coast, plus Chicago, Dallas and New York, because, based on my experiences, they'd be a great travel host for foreigners touring the U.S. Just try to avoid the odd check-in dude in Honolulu.

### "They should be ashamed"
Not Verified |  Medford to Seattle. Never flew, they kept us waiting know full well we'd never fly out that night. When we asked for a refund and vouchers for a hotel and gas see as how we drove 2.5 hours to get to Medford we were given nothing. When I told them that wasn't acceptable they called the cops and called me threatening? It's now 12:06 in the morning and we have just now got a hotel. We are a family of 5, my girls being 3, 6 and 11 they left us stranded in their parking lot for hours. Alaska Airlines is garbage I paid well over $1000 for this trip to them alone and this is how we are treated. They should be ashamed of how they treated us.

### "Very unprofessional"
Juneau to Las Vegas via Seattle. Juneau needs Delta Air Lines again, or anything else. Very unprofessional. I am unsure if they checked the plane before leaving their last location, but somehow the engines were not working 100% when they were trying to leave Juneau, yet they did not check this before boarding everyone and making them wait 2 hours before letting them back off in Juneau. This has caused wasted time of my very short and expensive trip! Very unhappy.

### "Basically buy another flight"
Going to 49ers vs Seahawks in Seattle. NFL changes game from 2:25 afternoon to the Sunday night game. To change my flight because of this $193. The flight leaves and hour and 15 minutes late. One of the engines gets a 'fuel leak' and we stop in Boise. After waiting 3 hours we are told there are no flights going to Seattle, call reservations for help. Basically buy another flight tomorrow or go with someone else? So no its $193 to change the flight because NFL changed the time of the game, and then  you're stranded here all day, lose out on the hotel you booked in Seattle and go buy another flight? The attendants working the desks super rude, did nothing for me when I walked up for help/update.

### "I don't recommend"
Flight from Oklahoma City to Seattle was sub-par. Decent service but poor internet service. My nightmare came true after boarding my connecting flight to Pullman. After everyone had boarded, the captain came over the intercom to announce the flight was cancelled due to weather. So we deplaned, and were advised to go to the customer service desk near the gate. Low and behold, there was a long line. It took me roughly 90min to get to the front of the line. During that 90min wait, I was automatically rebooked to the same flight the next day, which I was not about to risk another cancellation. When it was my turn to get helped, the agent said there was no other alternative. He "claimed" all nonstop flights to Spokane were overbooked, Spokane via Portland and/or Boise were sold out. I did a search on the Alaska Air app and saw he wasn't telling the truth. I saw there was room in economy on a Seattle-Portland-Spokane flight, and he wouldn't rebook me to those flights because it was "inaccurate". He told me to take my current rebooking or leave it in the rudest tone. They wouldn't even accommodate a hotel reservation, and expected me to wait in the airport for over 24hrs to board the flight I was rebooked on again. I wasn't about to do that, so I reserved a room at a nearby hotel. I didn't leave the airport until almost 2am at this point on Xmas Eve. At the hotel, I was given the number for customer care by a very nice woman. I called, requested a call back due to extended wait times. I was called back, and the agent was very helpful. I told him what I've experienced, how aggravated I was and how the agent at the airport couldn't rebook me because of inaccuracy. Surprisingly, he was very sympathetic about how I didn't want to risk getting on the same flight and have it cancelled again. He went above and beyond by getting me on a seat on a late morning Spokane flight in first class. I was thankful for his generosity. I still have a flight from Pullman to Oklahoma City via Seattle I need to take after New Years. However, regardless of what I experience during that trip (hopefully nothing like what I experienced on the way to Pullman), I'm very certain I will never fly Alaska again after what I experienced. I don't recommend anyone fly this airline until they get their act together.

### "will not be flying again with you"
Los Cabos to San Diego. My wife and children (7, 9 and 12 years old) and I have been at the airport since checking in at 12pm. Told by the airline rep that the flight is delayed from 3.40pm to 4.40 pm. It’s 5.09pm and no one had the courtesy to advise us and the other passengers that the flight was delayed until 8.20 pm that is, in excess of 5 hours. Only found that out through the internet. Went to speak to the airline rep to be told it is what it is! Love to spend my last day of holidays sitting at an airport in Mexico not knowing what the heck is going on with 3 restless, tired and hungry children. Thank you Alaska Airlines I will definitely will not be flying again with you and recommend you to my acquaintances.

### "impressed with their customer service"
Phoenix to Everett via Santa Ana. I had to rebook with Alaska Airlines because of a delay of another airlines. Because of this my luggage was lost. I dealt with Alaska Airlines at each stop. I am writing this because each associate went above and beyond to help me locate my luggage. Three people were in contact making sure I was helped. They located my luggage and had it delivered to me within two days of my flight. I am so impressed with their customer service. Thank you to all of you who helped me.

### "a very pleasant experience"
Los Angeles to San Francisco. Overall, a very pleasant experience on Alaska on this short flight between LAX and SFO. Excellent service at LAX check-in, as well as in the Alaska lounge at LAX, and once on board the plane. I usually hate US domestic flights, but this one was really a pleasure from start to finish. Well done, Alaska!

### "airline is extremely disorganized"
Lihue to Medford via Portland. 30 hours and counting still not sure if we are going to make it home. In Lihue, Kauai our plane needed a fuel filter. We sat with two children (3 and 6 y.o) for a 4 hour delay. Boarded the plane then the only tug broke down after hooking up to our plane. Sat for another hour. These delays caused us to miss our connections. We were told our hotel vouchers would be awaiting us in Portland. After landing at 115 a.m the Alaska desks were a ghost town. We finally found someone to help at baggage desk. We were booked on the 7 am flight next day, given cab vouchers, and a hotel room. The cab vouchers were for a company that does not run 3 am, we had to uber. Before we left another employee calls us back to the desk to inform us the 7am flight had been canceled due to lack of a crew so our only option was 4PM or 630p.m! Mind you we did not have access to our clothes or toiletries. I am now sitting at the airport in Portland awaiting the 4 pm flight.. We have just been informed that they don't have a pilot to fly our plane. We are now scheduled to hopefully leave at 545. The staff has been very nice and have attempted to make things right and I have tried to keep my patience. It just seems as though this airline is extremely disorganized.

### "customer service is poor"
Portland to Medford. The worst airline ever. If your looking for them to change your flight time 2 to 3 time then definitely book with them. The customer service is poor and could care less about its customers. And trying to get a refund or any compensation for the poor service is next to impossible. Unless you consider a meal voucher, (which is 12 dollers and not food or alcohol) as good compensation then your better taking your money elsewhere.

### "fly with someone else next time"
Not Verified |  Kauai to Seattle. First off they delayed our flight until 3am. We couldn’t do that because we have a 1.5 year old child. When we finally got on a flight the next day they were delayed again for 3 hours. After we got to Seattle we sat on the tarmac for 2 hours waiting to get to a terminal. They kept telling us we were going up there but we never moved... all the while everyone on the plane was breathing in gas fumes from the other planes. The last thing you want to do is sit on a flight for over 2 hours after a 6 hour flight! I say fly with someone else next time!

### "excuses upon excuses"
We landed and then sat on the taxiway with no word from the cockpit except for "folks this should only take 5 minutes to wait for the gate to clear. Cut to over an hour later and we're still just sitting here. My friends who took a separate Alaska flight from the same terminal at LAX which departed after our flight had already taken off have been sitting in the terminal waiting with their checked bags already collected. All we're getting is excuses upon excuses for why they cant simply bring us a jetbridge or deplane in another fashion. Nobody wants to take an responsibility and its frankly disgusting. Whoever was in charge of scheduling Alaska flights through Seattle on 12/20/19 deserves to be fired, absolutely unacceptable, I'll fly delta next time as i am watching several of their planes lands and taxi to the gate with no issue.

### "have lost all patience with this airlines"
Los Angeles to Seattle. The flight was totally normal all the way to Seattle. Once we touched down the flight attendant explained that we needed to taxi for 5 mins before heading to our gate. It has now been 2 hours! I’m still on the plane moving ever slightly around the airport with no explanation of why it’s taking so long. I’m extremely tired and exhausted and have lost all patience with this airlines. Would not recommend Alaska Airlines to anybody because it truly sucks. To be totally honest, after you have read this review I probably will still be on the Tarmac!

### "on the tarmac for over an hour"
Not Verified | Portland to Lihue Kauai. Been stuck on the tarmac for over an hour with little to no communication after a 6 and half hour flight while other airlines are able to get to a different gate. It is apparent that there is no plan B or backup plan to get customers on their way! I will never fly Alaska Airlines again.

### "Super comfortable flight"
Portland to Tucson. Super comfortable flight with great seats. Excellent flight crew. One of the flight attendants was so good at her job, if she was in the ad no one would believe it. The pilots landed the plane as smoothly as it could be done - amazing!

### "carrier has slipped dramatically"
Boston to Seattle. Alaska Airlines used to be my favorite domestic USA/Canada carrier (although would choose most foreign carriers over north american if possible). Unfortunately, the carrier has slipped dramatically. The seats were uncomfortable and tiny, they've switched to tablet rental with minimal pocket space on the seat backs, it was cramped and uncomfortable. On a 6-hour flight, the flight attendants only seemed to be there to make more money selling mediocre food, drinks, and tablet rental (except for the constant water hand-outs to prevent people from dying from dehydration). They kept kicking me and bumping in to me, the toilets were a mess ... sad to see this formerly decent carrier slip into Spirit/Frontier land. The only bright side was the large amount of overhead bin space. In my mind this is the only thing that Alaska beats Delta on now, in most other aspects Alaska has become sub-standard

### "flight crew was amazing!"
Not Verified |  I was given for( my 85th birthday a trip with 9 family members )a trip to Maui. Hawaii Flew from Eugene Oregon to Seatle then from there to Hawaii! I want to say it was so pleasant and the flight crew was amazing! They wished me a Happy Birthday and gave me a key nice bag with some treats and Wrote a very special birthday note Signed by the "Your Alaska Crew" Tonya, Christianna and Angie were the sweetest gals and made my trip special!!!! My daughter took care of all the tickets and details so I am not sure which flight. we Left Eugene Oregon at 5:15 am or thereabout on the 4th and went to Seattle for the next flight! not sure which flight but hope you can investigate and give this crew My best for a Happy Holiday and Thanks for making my trip special.

### "Good and warm service"
Los Angeles to San Francisco. 1.5 H flight from LAX to SFO with A320. Business class seats looks new and clean. Free WIFI for Text only and some snacks, one Air crew only for the business class but it fine. Good and warm service

### "it's just getting worse"
Not Verified |  Alaska's first class service is just not ready for coast to coast travel. They have no coat storage. Seats are not very comfortable and don't recline much for first. It then took about 2 hours for the meal service to make it to us with only 1 stressed flight attendant serving and preparing the meals and drinks. Alaska's transcontinental service and seats were basically designed for short hauls. I have had great service and seats on United, JetBlue and others. I have tried Alaska now twice since the merger with Virgin America, and it's just getting worse.

### "Horrible service as usual"
Fort Lauderdale to Anchorage via Seattle. Horrible service as usual. I fly back and forth to Florida and this time was forced to use Alaska Airlines. Before I start with the issue let me speak about their planes and service in general. Seats that don’t recline more than 1 inch, horrible staff, no screens on the seats like every other airline (they make you rent a tablet). The food is horrible and the bathrooms are small. We were late leaving the gate in Fort Lauderdale only by 5 minutes. Upon arriving in Seattle they had a plane blocking our gate so it took 30 minutes before we could dock the plane. I had to rush off the plane and I only made my gate with one minute to spare before they shut the doors on me. When I called to lodge a complaint they said there’s nothing they can do unless they made me miss it which I would have had I not ran like crazy. This is unacceptable. They blamed the 5 minute tardiness out of Fort Lauderdale, not the fact that they had one of their other aircraft blocking the gate. So basically. If you fly with these people you may not make it ever, and they do not care.

### "not what I had hoped for"
Not Verified |  Recently flew from Anchorage to Tampa via Seattle. The flights were fine overall, great service, professional crews and the planes were in great shape. Overall a 9/10. The return flights were not what I had hoped for. No problem encountered with the actual flight crews but the ground staff, or lack thereof is another story. My flight out of Tampa was delayed by about 4 hours due to the original plane having to be replaced in Seattle due to mechanical issues, I understand this as it happens every once in awhile to all airlines. Needless to say this caused me to miss my connection in Seattle back up to Anchorage. There was no Alaska representative at our gate in Seattle when we landed and nobody staffing the Customer Service section. I ended up calling their customer service section and was impressed with how understanding the woman I spoke with was to my situation. She offered me a hotel but it was about 2am and my flight was to depart at 8am so I thanked her and said no. She offered to find me a flight on Delta but I declined the offer as well. My new flight did depart ontime and although I stayed up all night I was more than glad to arrive back home around 7 hours late. I had the time as I am retired but had I been working, it would have been a different story.

### "Terrible customer service"
Not Verified |  San Diego to Seattle. Terrible customer service and awful management from the customer complaint team to the airline reservation team. Huge issues with traveling with an Esa dog and poor ability to communicate between departments. This airline used to be good and now it’s just absolutely cheap with some rude staff, and lacks the ability to come up with solutions.

### "Customer service is horrible"
Not Verified |  Los Angeles to Baltimore via New York. Alaska Airlines took over a wonderful airline called Virgin America and destroyed it! Customer service is horrible and rude they over charge at any instance. I had hopes they would follow in Virgin Americas footsteps but the opposite is true. I will never fly them again and will get rid of my Alaskan airlines credit card.

### "kept giving us false information"
Not Verified |  San Francisco to Los Angeles with Alaska Airlines. Worst airline crew, there was a delay due to weather and that is fine, but the delay was due to the crew not being prepared. The captain also kept giving us false information on the departure and arrival time, if you don't know the accurate numbers/time just say so, please dont lie to us. When someone says a of couple minutes it is not supposed to mean 40-50 mins.

### "my seat was downgraded"
Not Verified |  Anchorage to Missoula. What is up with this airline? Literally every time I fly there is an issue. I’ve flown 40k this year, and this time my seat was downgraded and the flight was delayed. Last time mine and my girlfriends seats were downgraded. The flight before my bag was lost. I am loyal to these guys, but they can’t ever get it together

### "never volunteer to check a carryon"
Not Verified |  After a fiasco with an original flight that was missed due to a traffic accident that closed the road, I was able to book a later flight to Las Vegas. In Anchorage they asked for volunteers to check their carryons to reduce the weight. Since I was grateful that Alaska Airlines was able to get me another flight that day, I gave them mine. Figured it was the least I could do. Didn't expect too much difficulty. Agent said the bag would go all the way to Vegas. It didn't. Got to baggage claim there and found out it only made it to Portland. The agent said they would most likely put it on the earliest flight from PDX, around 8am the next day, and they would bring it to the front desk of the hotel. They didn't. They put it on a flight to Seattle instead. So, I'm in this hotel, my toiletries et al are in Seattle and I don't know that I'll get the bag before I fly back the next day so I had to replace the items at the shop in the hotel. They charge $5 just for a bottle of water! But I had no choice. So, my budget for a 3 day trip was blown in 1 hour. I did get my bag after 1pm that day. But I will never volunteer to check a carryon with Alaska Airlines. I can't afford it. 5

### "So many people missed the flight"
Not Verified | Los Angeles to Edmonton via Seattle. Figure out your logistics. Having a plane land 10 minutes after boarding call on the next connecting flight is the stupidest thing I’ve ever witnessed during a flight. I had to run as fast as I could to go three terminals over in Seattle to make it. So many people missed the flight that the weight distribution had to be recalculated and signed off prior to taking off. If enough time was given for these patrons to make the flight, we would have been less delayed. Also, I booked a one-way flight but ended up on one with a transfer. It was communicated that my flight would land in Edmonton at 9:40 which ended up being the time to board the next flight. All in all, this was the worst experience I’ve had flying considering other delays I’ve had to deal with had valid reasoning for them. I sifted through one of the magazines during the wait and noticed an article on military working for the armed forces and Alaskan at the same time. I’m hoping they’re volunteering or supplementing their livable wage and that Alaskan is paying them enough. You would need to pay a premium to deal with the angry customers having terrible experiences on the services offered.

### "ashamed of this airline"
Las Vegas to San Francisco. Alaska delayed our flight 6.5 hours, and then we did not get on the plane till the next day but they did not accommodate for anything. A simple meal ticket that was not alcoholic for 12 dollars. 12 dollars for my 7 hours of time, plus my Uber home since we got home at 1:30 am. Really ashamed of this airline.

### "a 30 minutes take off delay"
We have used Alaska Airlines for most of our flights to destinations in the Western United States over the last several years. While convenient that Alaska flies non stop to many destinations in this area this comes often at a steep price. We have had a problem with almost every other flight. We have experienced two cancellations for flights from Burbank to Portland in two consecutive years. Needless to say that this is maximally inconvenient. Today there was a 30 minutes take off delay and while I am writing this Review the plane has landed but can’t get to the gate since the gate is occupied by another aircraft - one has to wonder what organizational skill set allows for this kind of nonsense. We still use Alaska but i try to prepare myself for maximum inconvenience with each trip.

### "Terrible experience and staff"
San Francisco to San Diego. Terrible experience and staff. Our flight was delayed several times because they didn’t have a crew to fly. I have OAB and needed to use the bathroom while waiting forever to take off, and they denied me that. I don’t know what for because we waited around for another 20 minutes before even beginning to move. Also my seat wears grungy and wouldn’t recline. I’ve had a better experience flying with Spirit.

### "flights are just consistently bad"
Phoenix to Portland. Hard seats, feels like climbing into an amusement ride. Speaker next to my head must have been about 90 decibels, so I had to plug my ears any time the staff was talking. The windows line up between the seats and you can’t see out. Typical for my flights with Alaska, there is some kind of delay and we are sitting on the tarmac for a long time. Then worsened because no one is available to open the door. The flights are just consistently bad.

### "would not let us on the flight"
We were flying Dallas to San Francisco for our 5 year anniversary and when we got to the airport the TSA lines were abnormally long. We managed to get threw and arrived at our gate 5 min before our departure time, but they still would not let us on the flight. The worst part is that our airplane sat at the gate for another thirty minutes before they finally backed away while almost ten passengers sat inside looking out the window. Meanwhile the gate next to us held the flight an extra 5 min after the flight time for passengers that were in line. The flight attendants were very rude about the situation and not at all empathetic. we were told that they had no other available flights for the entire day and we would have to reschedule. We will definitely not be flying Alaska again. They clearly don’t have any consideration for their passengers if they will close a plane early knowing that there are that many checked in customers standing in line because of uncontrollable circumstances. At least wait until the flight time.

### "most unprofessional group"
Fort Lauderdale to Spokane via Seattle. Thank you for hiring the most unprofessional group of people I have ever had to deal with. Flight attendants could’ve cared less about the passenger's needs when a delay and bussing passengers to the gates, in the rain was announced. My inquiry was followed by a stern “go look at the board when you get there” Really?! I am on crutches with a broken foot and you can’t do your job and answer my question? I would like to say, end of story but that was only the beginning of my nightmares with Alaska! Long story short, I was lied to, refused by your transporter to take me to my connecting flight, insinuated to be a liar by a Customer Service Rep when I attempted to explain why I was standing in front of her and not on the plane, that quite frankly, none of us are really sure was even at the airport to load into at all, only to have my boarding pass thrown at me and told she wasn’t dealing with me anymore when I calmly asked if she was calling me a liar when I told her transport refused to take me to connection. A manager told us all (about 100-150) it is what it is, Alaska isn’t at fault so you can sleep in the airport for 2-13hrs. Yes, I finally got them to get me a room after much discussion and someone videoing him telling me I could sleep at the airport with my crutches and a broken foot. Because of your crew, I have lost an entire day to help my family in the midst of a family emergency. And been penalized by my car rental agency because I wasn’t on time picking up! Way to take care of your passengers! Because of this, I now know which airline not to fly and will be sure all of my associates and friends know the same!

### "cancellation the price of the ticket"
San Diego to San Jose. I booked a flight for a wedding that has since then been cancelled. It was very frustrating to discover that the cancellation fee is the price of the ticket. What makes it worse is they wont deduct the fee from the money I already paid for the ticket. I have to pay for it out of pocket and then hold a credit to fly with them again. I support having cancellation fees but they should be proportionate to the ticket amount and it should be deducted from the money that has already been paid. This policy is not customer focused and frankly enraging. They would not consider doing a one time waiver. I hope I am never in a situation where I have to fly with them again.

### "Worst experience ever"
Reno to Seattle. Worst experience ever that I’ve had with flying. I’m On a multi trip destination and this is my second trip with them. They literally have no idea what’s going on. Never have I have been questioned if I’m “ok” to fly. The younger flight attendant was rude and not friendly at all. She yells at me to get back to my assigned seat when I got up to get my jacket in the overhead bin. Now we have been waiting for over 45 mins after landing when my layover plane leaves in 12 mins but they won’t let us off the plane because they don’t have a spot for us. How do you let this happen?

### "bag didn't make it on the plane"
On my recent flight to SFO from IAD, my bag never made it on the plane so I had to pay a large out of pocket fee to deliver the late bag to my final destination. The bag didn't make it on the plane because the representative at the ticket counter at IAD received my bag telling me "you're good to go sir" when in fact it was too late for my bag to be checked onto the flight. I was misinformed by the Alaska employee at the ticket counter and she made a mistake. This is totally forgivable, if its fixed, but Alaska failed to do this. I repeatedly called customer service, and even resorted to emailing senior executives at the company - even they couldn't get a resolution! I consistently encountered an "its not my problem" attitude at Alaska, which was really unfortunate. Customer services is a critical piece when choosing an airline to be committed to in the long term - take my experience into consideration.

### "worst experience ever"
Honolulu to San Francisco. Family of 8 nightmare. We get to the airport and the systems are down. I go to the counter and inform the staff that my family of 8 is here please inform our gate, she says they know, I stand back in line to be told our flight left and they can only fly 4 or my party of 8 home to another airport (San Francisco). We had to spend more money to get home. The rest of us had to come out of pocket to spend an extra day in a hotel totally not budgeted for this. I get to the airport the next day and they do not have my 13-year-old on the flight with us, I had to stand in line for 45 min for them to figure out a solution. We travel yearly and usually use Southwest but went with Alaska and had the worst experience ever. We paid plenty of money to make sure our kids had a memorable experience and this is all they remember now.

### "Terrible all around"
Los Angeles to BostonTerrible all around ... you have to pay for headphones, they do drinks two times if that and there always a delay. We had a delay when boarding and then over an hour on the tarmac when waiting. They kept saying in a few minutes and then never announced what was happening til 40 minutes later. I have taken every airline and this is by far the worse will not travel with them again

### "lack of sympathy"
Not Verified | Tampa to Seattle. We can't print out the boarding pass through the machine. We were told to go to the counter. The lady at the counter refused to print the boarding pass with my confirmation code. She requested all the family to physically be at the counter. I have explained my parents are old. I prefer not to ask them to go up and down the stairs. But the reason she gave is that you are pretty early, they have enough time to move to the counter. I am shocked by this kind of lack of sympathy for the senior people. It is Alaska's fault that the machine can't print the pass, but my parents need to pay for that fault. Is this fair?

### "Once seated I dare not move"
Not Verified |  Detroit to Seattle. I am 6’9” tall. I weigh in at 300+ lbs and disabled. I am not obese by any means. I’m tall and wide! The seating arrangements are so tight, so as to make me wedged into my seat. Once seated I dare not move. My Wife, (and travel partner) is rather petite and fits well into her seat. The problem is the person on the other side. The width of my shoulders tends to encroach into my neighbors area. I have no choice! I am what I am. I am unable to remove any part of my body to accommodate the person seated next to me. When I called Alaska Airlines and tried to discuss this, the only option I was offered was to purchase a second seat. This is not financially possible. This is the issue that comes up when you cram as many seats as possible into a limited space. On our return flight, I can guarantee there will be similar issues. Please let me apologize in advance for any and all discomfort I cause to my fellow travelers as well as any burden or bad publicity that falls on Alaska Airlines. There is one more option. What would the cost be to upgrade my Wife and I to first class seating? I’m not sure this is a financially sound option for us, but I just thought I would think about it before I showed up to gate.

### "flight attendants clearly hated their jobs"
Not Verified |  Boston to Seattle. This is the worst cross country flight I’ve ever had. I’ve flown just about every airline and I can’t believe Alaska charges for everything but soft drinks. When you’re flying a 6 hour flight shouldn’t they throw in pretzels or peanuts for goodness sake? The flight attendants clearly hated their jobs, they were snappy and short tempered. They even charge for a tablet to watch tv! I will not fly Alaska Airlines again.

### "never be flying Alaska Airlines again"
Los Angeles to Salt Lake City. Had a 6 hour lay over that was delayed but an extra 2 hours. This whole terminal in Los Angeles is full of delayed Alaska Airlines flights. They keep placing other flights at higher priority over ours because they are that far behind. And even when you get in the flight the seats are uncomfortable, poor drinks, service is fine but the flight just seems to take hours longer than it really does due to no entertainment options. Poor WiFi options. I’ll never be flying with Alaska Airlines again.

### "assigned seat in Premium Economy"
Flew round-trip from Los Angeles to Seattle on Alaska Airlines Basic Economy. I was assigned a window seat on Boeing 737-900 from L.A. to Seattle. Smooth flight with 1 hour of free wifi courtesy of T-Mobile. There was no seat-back IFE on this flight, and playing movies on Alaska's mobile app isn't very straightforward. On the return flight, the Alaska Airline's gate agent was super friendly. Agent called up my name and said that he noticed that I was flying roundtrip with same day flights, so assigned me a seat in Premium Economy with more legroom. The flight from Seattle to L.A. was on A320 previously operated by Virgin America. The overall experience on Virgin America-configured A320 was far superior to Alaska's traditional B737.

### "Happy flying with them"
Los Angeles to Portland. Loved the seating and legroom. they also provide movies, water and the cabin crew are friendly. loved the airplane interior as well. Happy flying with them.

### "we still haven't left the gate"
Seattle to Tampa with Alaska Airlines. Five hours and we still haven't left the gate. Few updates and the crew is getting irascible, I can't wait to spend six more hours with them in the air.

### "seating parents away from minor children"
Maui to Seattle. I was seated separately to my 8 and 9 year old sons on our return from Hawaii. Rising only three times to get my kids food, clean up spilt water and assist with the bathroom, the passenger next to me complained that I was bothering her enjoyment of the flight. An Alaska Airline flight attendant told me that I must stay in my seat and that I was being a nuisance. The safety risk and real nuisance is Alaska Airlines seating parents away from minor children.

### "really appreciate the Alaska crew"
Seattle to Anchorage via Juneau. Our connection flight at Juneau, AK was canceled due to mechanical problem, therefore we missed our Cruise boarding at Anchorage, AK. The crew at Juneau international Airport was so courtesy and kind enough to deal with the cruise line so we could board the ship at its next calling port. And they also arranged a flight from Juneau, AK, local accommodation and food. Their service was supervisor, especially after we were literally 'dumped' by Delta Air, because it started when Delta failed to make proper arrangements when the originated flight delayed 4 hours, and we missed the connection flight at Salt Lake City, we had to purchase our own tickets for the remaining trip to Anchorage, AK to catch our Cruise. I really appreciate the Alaska crew at the Juneau Airport for helping.

### "they lacked the professionalism"
1 hour and 20 minute flight from San Francisco to Las Vegas in First Class. I was expecting a service akin to British Airways Club Europe or Lufthansa Business Class. In fact the only service offered was drinks and a snack which consisted of a chocolate bar! Crew were polite, but as is typical of crew from the US, they lacked the professionalism, refinement and finesse of crews from elsewhere in the world.

### "aren't what they used to be"
San Jose to San Diego. They aren't what they used to be. Early morning flight delayed 2 hours. No email, text or notification by app was given. First explanation was that pilots needed to have a mandatory 2 hr break from their list flight, then the explanation was the pilots flew into a different airport and needed to be transported. Our flight attendant said he thought it had to do with the hotel they all stayed at needing to be evacuated the night before. Whatever really happened lies were told regardless. The common courtesy I expect for delayed flights would be to notify passengers of the delay ahead of time, but Alaska didn't seem interested in this. No email, no text, no app updates. I only learned of the 2 hr delay once I got through TSA. The store notification I did receive was that boarding began 30 mins before the notification was sent (received at 0745 that boarding will start at 0715) and new flight time was issued (0755). Wasn't even close to what happened. Only started boarding 10 mins after the original delayed boarding time at 0805. So initially my only issue was the lack of notification when they did give one, it was completely off. Not to mention the series of lies they told to quell the crowd around their desk. Sad to see Alaska go the way of ineptitude, just another Spirit or Frontier.

### "incompetent handling of missing baggage"
Anchorage to Seattle. Completely incompetent handling of missing baggage claim: the missing bag was found 5 days ago but I am still waiting for Alaska to send it to me. The bag is sitting in the Seattle baggage office but despite numerous emails and calls, they appear to be unable or unwilling to send the bag to me - apparently because I live outside of the US and this is just too much trouble for them to deal with. I suggest international travellers think twice before travelling on Alaska.

### "made lives that much harder"
Pasco to Maui via Seattle. My son was asked if he wanted to go to Hawaii a few weeks ago. His best friend's parents were taking him to Hawaii as a graduation present from the year before and his girlfriend was going to go with him. She purchased her ticket back in March, and then because of school issues, was not able to go, so they asked my son if he would be willing to pay the $125 change fee and go with to Hawaii. Being a 17 year old, he was in. When she (girlfriend) called back on the 16th of August to make the change, the agent informed her that there is an additional $223 fare change fee on top of that. Being she was an 18-year-old going to college Freshman, she was shocked and paid the fees without consulting anyone. She then contacted my 17-year-old son to let him know about the additional fee. So on top of the $680 ticket, there is now a $125 fee change fee, a $223 fare difference fee, and he didn't know what to do because it was already a done deal. I told them not to worry and I would give customer service a call. I got a lot of run around talk. I heard a lot of "there is nothing we can do"! I asked if this was purely company policy and they said yes. I asked to speak to a manager that had the authority to make changes, and I was put in touch with her. She said, "There is nothing I can do! I asked her if that was a company policy or the law. She said company policy. I said, then don't tell me there is nothing you can do, tell me there is nothing you are willing to do. I get it that there are people out there that will try and take advantage of a company and manipulate the system. I am wondering, however, why a $960 million dollar company is excited to take advantage of an 18-year-old Freshman going to college, and a 17-year-old senior in high school, why would I ever fly them again? The sad part is, I had a bad experience with them 4 years ago when my daughter was a part of the State Sports Committee and needed to change a flight, they were no different. Gouging teenagers that had valid reasons to change tickets, that Alaska Airlines already owned. It's not like they were out anything, they just needed to change a name. Instead of this person flying, this other person is flying. They tried to make us feel better because apparently we should have been charged (2) $125 change fees plus the airfare difference and they only charged us one. Well, I hope this helped build the shareholder confidence in your company because I will do everything within my power to not fly Alaska and never get your credit card. Thanks for taking advantage of a 17 & 18-year-old innocence. I hope you sleep well at night knowing you just made 2 teenage lives that much harder due to the fact they both had to pay their own way to make this happen. Then their flight ended up being 2 hours late taking off while they sat on the tarmac.

### "premium seats were exactly the same"
Booked a RT ticket to Vegas from SFO. I upgraded our return trip seats to premium seats that promised 4" more of space for convenience. Our premium seats were exactly the same as the seats we had on the the way over Alaska Airlines flight that were just economy (Main).

### "don’t care about guests comfort"
San Francisco to New York JFK. Dirty, outDated, no customer service & no perks whatsoever. No back-of-seat screens. They expect you to bring your own screen or rent a tablet from them. Very poor notification system for flight delays and changes. Flight attendants are rude and don’t care about guests comfort, don’t assist customers and act annoyed any time they are spoken to about anything. WiFi and “entertainment” system connectivity is so bad that it may a surprise we’ll not exist. At least I brought a book.

### "they have no regard for customers or service"
NotVerified |  Flew from Burbank to Spokane 8/2. Return was supposed to be 8/6 thru Portland. ALL four flights were late. The return flight from Spokane to Burbank via Portland was cancelled and had to fly to LAX then LYFT to Burbank to get my car. Horrible service, really screwed up airline. Never again. Shredding my Alaska credit card. My traveling companion mistakenly booked return a full week later, her fault but Alaska card member. The gate agents said there was room on all flights so would not be a problem, just had to call corporate. Corporate was happy to rebook, $125 plus 17000 miles! She did it, then got screwed on return flight mentioned above. These people have no shame. The entire industry is a debacle treating people worse than cattle. Alaska claims to have a great reputation. In reality they have no regard for customers or service. Good bye Alaska, you should be ashamed.

### "flight attendants were amazing"
We had a flight from Seattle to Phoenix and then back again. On both flights, the flight attendants were amazing. We have a 1 year old who was very fussy coming home and the flight attendant gave us parents chocolate and were so sweet and patient with our crying baby. They came by with different things to entertain and distract him for a bit which really was above and beyond. I will definitely fly with them again. Way to go Alaska!

### "this is the poorest first class"
Not Verified |  Los Angeles to Newark in first class. Unlike other first class i've been, they don't great you personally with any drink offers once you board the flight, there is tiny little water bottle on your seat and that will be it. Food is very basic, sandwich and soup, no salad/snacks/dessert, looks like fast food, but the turkey sandwich is actually taste good. It is an overnight flight for 4-5 hours and i requested for blanket, they don't even have a single blanket on board! No TV screen for first class! You are on your own to get everything. So disappointed, this is the poorest first class I've ever used!

### "didn't even offer me a drink"
Not Verified |  I'm writing this on behalf of my dad, who doesn't have an online presence. After spending years convincing him that First Class was worth the extra money, this is what he has to say about his flight on Alaska Airlines Seattle to Newark, Saturday 26th July, 2019. Crummy breakfast, and they didn't even offer me a drink.

### "definitely mind this airline."
Not Verified |  New York to San Francisco. Flight should depart at 0700am. While waiting at the gate received an e-mail that the flight is reschedule to 03:45m! No announcement at the Airport and no customer service. The staff at ticketing counter is unpolite and shows no interest to help. Told just to call the hotline. There more than 30 minutes holding line but nobody pick up the phone. They even not offer a cup of water although the flight got 9 hours delay! In future i will definitely mind this airline.

### "joining the ranks of cheap airlines"
Seattle to Minneapolis. Alaska is joining the ranks of cheap airlines in loading the plane, then fixing mechanical issues while the plane is full. This particular issue is easy to spot during routine maintenance. We sat for 2.5 hours in the plane without A/C at near 95f in rear of plane, then deplaned after 2+ hours, and now, more than 4 hours later we don’t have any clear departure time. So frustrating!

### "Really great service"
Houston to Seattle. No wait at check-in, quick boarding, flight left on time, comfortable seat. Really great service from crew - very friendly, efficient and kind. Great food and drinks. Baggage delivered very quickly. Hard to fault - so much better then any US domestic carrier I have used before.

### "refused to allow my ten year old daughter to board"
My ten year old daughter had a ticket to fly back home (Seattle) from visiting her father in MD this morning on Alaska Airlines flight 524. Security was slightly backed up, due to apparent staffing issues so her father checked with the ticketing desk to make sure she would make the flight. The ticketing counter employee assured him she would make it, radioed back to the gate and personally accompanied them to the gate. At the gate they refused to allow my ten year old daughter to board with her pre-purchased ticket because Alaska Airlines had already given away her seat and refused to remove the "stand by" passenger. Did I mention, my daughter broke her arm while on vacation, and had an appointment with an orthopedic surgeon today, which she will now miss because of Alaska's selfish decision to put profits over people. I have always tried to fly Alaska for both work and personal travel, but I can assure you, I will not be spending any more money to support this unethical company.

### "said the flight had left"
I arrived an hour early on 7/13/19 for my 8:25 flight. The check in desk wasn't staffed. Another company agent knocked on the office door so someone can assist us. The guy that came out just told us to go to the gate, no check in. We had a big suitcase prepaid and we had to carry it. Once we got to the gate D20 nobody was there at the desk but the plane was there. An Asian lady was behind the desk and said the flight had left. We were at the gate 20 minutes before departure. We were lied to that the plane left but I sat there and saw our plane leave 15 minutes later. The laziness of the employees cost me a day since the next flight was 10 hours later and connected through Seattle. Of course there were passengers let in late  for the second flight we were put on and they were let on. Unacceptable. Lack of care from the staff of team Alaska.

### "journey a nightmare"
Charleston to Anchorage via Seattle. Worst airline I've ever experienced. The staff lied to over 200 people. It's been a nightmare. How is it even possible to plan a trip with a bunch of unpredictable, unprofessional humans? It's not the quality of the planes, it's the quality of their employees that really made our journey a nightmare. Thanks, Alaska Airlines for a really poor time.

### "I am very disappointed"
❎ Not Verified | Dallas to Seattle. I am very disappointed. Alaska somehow couldn’t calculate that they did not meet the weight limit for checked baggage. I’m now in the dark as to when my bags will arrive. To be fair the personnel at the baggage claim gave me rewards for Alaska and said my bags will be on the next flight. However, I am in the military and I need my bags to check into my new command. So we’ll see how I look checking in, in civilian clothes. Thanks Alaska Airlines. I have never had this problem with competitors.

### "got away with highway robbery"
Columbus to Vancouver. We had a cancelled flight out of Port Columbus. I’m flying alone with my son, so we paid the premium for first class and a more comfortable experience. When the flight was cancelled, we were rebooked in economy. That in itself is not the problem. We were offered, nor refunded anything for the drastic change in class. I am out hundreds between the prepaid hotel room in Vancouver, the rental car, and the room I had to get last night because they were not prepared to maintain their aircraft. Not to mention the money I spent to fly in first class. I’m sitting on flight 1011 in Chicago now, (I also had to have multiple layovers now), and just busted my head on the reclined seat ahead of me. We were one of the last to board, meaning we can’t bring our carry ons now and I have nothing to entertain or care for my son. They were unhelpful, uncaring and basically just got away with highway robbery.

### "caused us to miss our flight"
Not Verified |  San Diego to Salt Lake City. The lack of training, lack of customer service caused us to miss our flight. Very incompetence people and they just don’t care. When you are there in plenty of time and it’s their lines and their staff that causes you to miss your flight, they need to compensate you in some way. We were there at the time they told us to be and was having problems with their kiosk and lines were horrible. If I could give them a zero I would. If you want to miss your flights because of their customer service go for it, or plan to be there 6 hours before for a domestic flight. I fly a lot, and have never been treated so poorly by other airlines. Do not use this airline. We had to rebuy tickets for triple the price, they are price gougers to make more money off their customer service.

### "not care about their passengers"
San Diego to Salt Lake City. Do not use this airline, they are horrible and do not care about their passengers. We were there in ample time (2 hours). There were only two people working their check in, and the lines were extremely long. So someone told us to use a kiosk, another line and passengers were confused how to use it. 30 minutes later, finally got to the kiosk, and it would not work, so got back in line, and their customer check in causes is to miss our flight by 2 minutes. They told us to call their customer service, we did, and all they could say is sorry, you needed to be here within two hours and we were. No discounts nothing, just buy another ticket, which I had zero money to buy another ticket. Thanks. Alaska airlines for screwing me over. Next time will be any airline but Alaska.

### "forget about Alaska Airlines"
❎ Not Verified | I can’t believe you have to pay $10 on a 5-hour flight for an iPad from them to watch movies. On Delta it’s free. Service was terrible. I gave Alaskan way too much credit reading a Forbes report and other reviews. There’s no way they are the number one airline. Also, we had a connector with them, the plane landed and sat on the runway waiting on a gate for 25 minutes, waited for another 10 to deboard, and we were on the other end of the airport. Our next Alaska flight decided to board early, and had left us before we could even get off the other plane. The staff was incredibly rude to us, wasn’t even going to help us out basically just told us off and said it was our fault. I’ve got a solid 50-60 flights under my belt with Delta. I know how to fly and I will not be told otherwise. Alaskan is awful. Not flying with any other airline but Delta. Delta helped us get home, thank goodness for them. Delta can run a company right, forget about Alaska Airlines.

### "I was blown away!"
Not Verified |  I booked a flight in April to attend my 35th class reunion in June. It was going to be a quick weekend trip back home. About 3 weeks before my trip I found out my mother (who I was going to be staying with) was diagnosed with cancer. I needed to fly out sooner than I thought so I called Alaska to see if I could change my flight. The customer service rep was very kind and pleasant. She told me there would be a hefty charge to change flights and the flight I wanted to change to was an additional $85. Without skipping a beat the rep waived the charge for the switch! I was blown away! My flight was excellent and I had a wonderful time with my mother and at the reunion. My flight home was just incredible as well! I got to my gate early thanks to me somehow getting TSA precheck on my boarding pass. While at the gate the agents asked if anyone would like to check their carry on since the flight was full. I went ahead and checked my carry on for no additional charge. As I waited to board one of the agents called my name and gave me my new boarding pass. They had changed my seat to business class (I was originally in row 20!) I never asked for preferential treatment! Needless to say I was thrilled with my new seat and the flight attendants were friendly and welcoming. This was the 4th time I flew with Alaska and I will always fly with them in the future.

### "love to see some things improved"
Dallas to Honolulu via Seattle. Alaska, you fly about a 3 star. It’s hit or miss to get a really wonderful, positive personality, flight attendant and or ticket counter worker. Today, we printed the bag tags at home. Using ink and paper and time. To get to the airport and have no way to attach the tags to our bags. Then had to stand in line anyway. So much for being ready in advanced. My partner was not happy about it. Time is so valuable. This needs to be fixed. We miss Virgin Airline planes. Big time. Can you please bring those staff members and those planes back? Virgin America staff had almost always a positive attitude and wow factor. Each plane is different with the entertainment. Very inconvenient. We would also love bigger seats so those people around us don’t keep bumping our shoulder or jogging over their own seat. Each seat should have their own designated overhead bin. Not where we have anxiety if we can use the overhead bin. We are card holders and we travel and pick you all almost 90% of the time. We would love to see some things improved.

### "change the name on the ticket"
Seattle to Detroit. Purchased a ticket for an employee that had take a leave of absence to care for a dying parent. I decided to take another employee on the business trip and when I contacted Alaska Airlines, they informed me that the ticket could not be changed. This trip is over a month away and I cannot wrap my brain around why they are not able to accommodate a simple name change. I could understand if I was asking to make changes withing a 24 hour period of the flight but the trip is more than 30 days away! I'm trying to remain professional and be understanding, I would happily pay a fee to have the changes made but I am not in a position to forfeit the $ for an airline ticket that could still be used. Someone please help me understand why this is so difficult to do? If I conducted my business in this way, I would be out of business. I would not recommend to my friends and family to travel with Alaska Airlines. This is not how you treat your customers. All I want to do is change the name on the ticket.

### "made us miss our flights"
Seattle to San Francisco. Do not fly with Alaska Airlines, their staff shortages made us miss our flights. We arrived nice and early to Seattle airport for a short hop to San Francisco onwards to Manchester, UK. We were first told to wait for the kiosks to check into our flight (check-in on-line was unavailable the night before) Once we had finished on the kiosks a ticked was issued saying our passports would need to be checked. We were then told we needed to stand in the “Assistance” lane. This lane was filled with every man and his dog (literally) there were 5 desks serving on the line we were in - only 2 of the 5 were occupied with staff (this was Memorial Weekend). The line moved very slowly as every person in this general assistance line had a long issue to resolve for example not having a Canadian eTa People we’re dropping out of this line like flies as they to were missing their flights due to incompetence from Alaska airways with regard to staffing levels on such a busy weekend. When we eventually got to the front of the queue after nearly 2 hours we had missed our first flight to San Francisco. I asked if a later flight was available at first the lovely and very apologetic staff member said yes and then made a call. After that call she was told us she was told to tell us we needed to call Condor/Thomas Cook to get us a new connecting flight as our flights were originally booked with them. After 20 minutes on hold Condor/Thomas Cook told us that it was ALASKA Airways would need to book us on to the new flights. By this time we had now missed that next available flight We were forced with either a $7000 economy flight later that day with another airline or fly home the next day from Vancouver which was a 4 hour taxi/coach ride away for $1400 total (including extra hotel stay). Our Tavel insurance would not cover the additional cost as airline incompetence is not covered. I complained to Alaska Airways who offered a $50 discount per person on flights with them. This is unacceptable as I will never fly Alaska Airlines again. Shocking. Stay away

### "made me miss my flight"
San Francisco to San Diego. Horrible delay by over an hour! Suppose to depart at 8.45pm but ended up departing at 10.35pm. Unacceptable! Staff was helpful tho but they could use more staff especially during times close to departure. Standing in the long line and TSA made me miss my flight

### "stay away from Alaska Airlines"
Tucson to San Jose via Seattle. The flight was initially delayed for more than an hour. Then an hour later, we were informed the entire flight was cancelled. Horrible experience as it ruined my plans to take care of business for the day. Spoke to a rep on phone to get flight out asap. Instead of going out of their way and think outside the box by looking at all airlines that could get me to my final destination asap, they stuck with only Alaska. I had to force them. That earliest flight ended up delaying my arrival 7 hours later leaving me with no time to take care of business and errands. The rep offered to provide me with a phone number so I could be compensated. Oh really? They expect me to give them a call in order to initiate a compensation? Horrible business strategy. Shouldn't they initiate the compensation for their lack of commitment and since it was them that screwed up? Why should I jump through barriers just to initiate compensation process? Never again with Alaska and I will spread the word among my acquaintances to stay away from Alaska Airlines.

### "cold, uncaring, unhelpful"
Not Verified |  Ticket agent was beyond unhelpful. She went out of her way to slow down our check in process and she made sure no other agents would help us to make our flight. She noticed we were out of breath from running from the rental car area to the checkout to make our flight. She said we were very close to the cutoff time. I agreed and said we needed to check two bags and get our boarding passes. She proceeded to ask whether or not I had checked in online. I confirmed I had. She then asked where my boarding passes were, then. I explained i did not have a printer to print them out. She then tried to explain that meant I had not officially checked in for the flight. In order to speed things up I tried to have her focus on getting the bags checked and the boarding passes printed. She said, again, we were close the cutoff and the bags might not make it. I told her that was fine, we just needed to make the flight. The bags could show up the next day. She then said we missed the cutoff and the only way to get on the flight now was to call the gate and ask if they would allow us. I said "please call them, then. She very slowly looked up the number, then called, and then I could hear her say "you can't let some late passengers through at this point, can you? I was dumbfounded. She looked at me and said the gate agents would not permit us to go through. We were still 30 minutes away from the departure time. We had TSA precheck, so we would have made it through the security in 5 minutes. We would have easily made the boarding process. I then moved to a different ticket agent. He was prepared to help. He said we were now past the cutoff time and he would have to call the gate agents. he was starting to call when the first lady walked over to him and explained how she had already called and there was nothing they could do. She gave him the evil stare that suggested he needed to stop helping us NOW! Which he did. Unbelievable. Very cold, uncaring, unhelpful and she went even further than that and appeared to work at making sure we did NOT make our flight.

### "smooth flight all around"
Los Angeles to Salt Lake City. Good flight with on-time pushback. Comfortable seats for a commuter flight. FAs attentive, Captain warned us about possibility of bumpy arrival on descent but smooth flight all around.

### "most horrible experience"
Not Verified |  Philadelphia to San Francisco. Absolutely the most horrible experience! They cancelled my flight 7 hours before it was to take off. They booked me on a flight that made me miss important meetings. They gave me all kinds of wrong information when I contacted them. They told me to go to the airport early in case there are cancelations. But, they have no one at the airport until an hour before the flight. They are running a really low budget operation. Not reliable at all. I will never ever use them again. I wish you had a 0 rating option.

### "flawed and failing"
Not Verified |  This is my fourth flight on Alaska in the last month. I am a regular, seasoned business and pleasure traveler, and fully acknowledge and have empathy for many of the challenges flight crew, boarding agents encounter on a daily basis. However, there are times when it becomes clear that the entirety of the system is flawed and failing . When such is the case, management should be held accountable. Alaska Airlines is flawed and failing. I will not provide a litany of specifics regarding the bad attitude, lack of service, hostile encounters with passengers that my family and I have witnessed over the past month. Indifferent, and then hostile gate agents at SFO, challenging passengers, addressing them with condescension and simply, utterly rude. SFO to DC..indifferent gate agents who could not be bothered to look up when customers were lined up in front of her. Was busy on her personal phone. In fact, a flight attendant working the flight approached us and others (without solicitation) to extend apologies for the indifference she observed at the gate. Think about it, Alaska flight attendants apologizing for the rude behavior of Alaska gate agents. DC to SFO. row 26, flight is delayed for nearly an hour as we sit on the runway. Gentlemen in row 26 F opens his lunch bag to snack. Does not take out table, etc. Male flight attendant confronts passenger and insists he put his lunch away in preparation for take off, really? DC to sfo. Toilet paper littering the aisle way. Same aforementioned flight attendant repeatedly simply walks over it. Makes no effort to clean. DC to SFO three hours into the flight a gentlemen in Row 6, walks to the area of row 26 and asks two attendants with cart why there has been no beverage or food service to his seat. Both attendants say ‘sir, sorry but we have no idea and we are sold out of everything’. He repeats his inquiry, to which they respond again ‘we are sold out of everything’.

### "I love flying Alaska"
Seattle to Atlanta. I love flying Alaska. The service is excellent, the flight attendants are friendly & willing to go out of their way when asked politely - (I’m surprised at how rude passengers can be, and I still see them being friendly). On our last flight from Seattle to Atlanta it was a little strange because we had to board a bus to get to the gate, which is a new thing, and I was concerned about getting off the ground on time because it seemed like everything was going too slow. We had a tight connection in Atlanta, & I was a bit worried. The staff was friendly & reassuring, and we took off on time & landed early.

### "at the airport for six hours"
Portland to Santa Ana. I always fly Southwest. It's never great and the employees clearly hate their jobs. But the plane is always on time and gets me to my destination safely. Today I have been at the airport for six hours. Because the plane was having Mechanical issues. The Alaska flight I decided to take because I wanted a better experience flying this time. What a joke and the mechanical issues they're having are missing radio parts! What kind of horrific problem is that? How could radio parts go missing! This has solidified that I will no longer be choosing Alaska. And the cc my mother has of theirs, the miles card, is getting cancelled. My toddler also has to be picked up by his 80-year-old grandfather because I'm not there. Never again.

### "Another great flight"
Another great flight with Alaska Airlines, Kansas City to Salt Lake City via Seattle and return. All flights on time, service is grea, Premium Economy upgrade, comfortable seats. GoGo inflight entertainment is wonderful to have on the longer flights. Spent time talking with the cabin crew, very friendly and helpful. We have been flying Alaska for over 10 years and have never had a bad flight.

### "assigned seats in different rows"
New York to Los Angeles. Couldn't check in online as the system online wasn't recognising all our details. When we arrived at the airport and began the checkin in process we were automatically assigned seats in different rows. We were told they could not change seats because the system was down. We were told that we can select seats at the gate. When we attempted to change our seats at the gate we were flatly told no because we were economy far holders. Was told that next time I should consider paying more. Found them to be unhelpul and rude. Also on the plane there was no WiFi despite it being advertised. Will not be flying with this airline again. American Airlines were far better.

### "locked out of checking in"
Seattle to Kansas City. Couldn't check in on their app or online, they had network issues. Got in the airport 45 mins before my flight, went to the service desk and they were locked out of checking in. The lady there took me to the supervisor, who was very rude, she said it's not her problem that they had network issues and asked if I read the customer agreement that says I should call customer service in case of network issues. All in all they kept me waiting for 30 mins that I could have made it to the gates and charged me again to rebook a flight.

### "Service was excellent"
Chicago O'Hare to Seattle. First time ever flying. I told them this at checkin. They offered me to meet the pilot and be the very first one to board to calm my nerves. Service was excellent. I would definitely fly with Alaska Airlines again if I was to fly. But flying is not for me, I only flew because I had to, my son got married. All I can say is they were awesome. The pilot explained every question I had.

### "not a good experience"
San Jose to San Diego. Not for families. Rude folks at the gate. All we asked was to place 2 tickets together and two more together if possible as we were three kids and 2 adults. She started with saying you bought cheap tickets and we don't have a say. She then gave us tickets or her choice 3 + 1 , which was not bad, but not before she embarrassed is for buying cheap tickets and indirectly asking us to shut up. The flight was very very dirty compared to Southwest. Flight was very hot until right before AC was switched on. Overall not a good experience.

### Alaska Airlines customer review
Seattle to California with Alaska Airlines. I'm not saying that the flight was bad, but the food. I mean seriously, it was horrible. Paid for a first class ticket and got a dang sandwich. Maybe Alaska Airlines should start to follow Turkish Airlines, now that's First Class at its finest!

### "wow do I miss Southwest"
Seattle to Chicago. I booked a personal flight using the saver fare. If you want to make any changes to your flight, even within 24 hours of booking the only thing they can do is cancel you flight, hold your money for 7 days, and then finally give a refund. I also travel a lot for business, I used to live in an area where Southwest had the most options. I now live in an area where Alaska Airlines has the most options, and wow do I miss Southwest. Once you book a flight on Alaska it's like they hold you hostage, and you aren't making any changes without getting ripped off. Living where I do I am forced to fly Alaska Airlines a lot, seems like every trip I take causes some sort of frustration. I miss Southwest!

### "never fly Alaska again"
Not Verified |  Ontario to Portland. I flew Alaska on 4/23. I was returning home from a trip, my first flight being on 4/17. My first flight was full and as such it was a struggle to not only find a place to put my carry on, but also retrieve it from the overhead bins they were so packed. On my returning flight, 4/23, to avoid this hassle, I checked my carry on, paying $30. While sitting at the gate an announcement came that the flight was full (just like the first flight was full, but no announcement was made on that flight) and they would be allowing people to check their bags for free. When I asked the customer service person #1, why they didn't do that on the last flight I was on despite it being full and #2, if I could possibly get a refund since my previous experience is why I checked my bag in the first place, I was told no refunds. I reached out to customer service, and they also said no refunds since I chose to check my bag. If I had known, I would have just held on to it and checked it at the gate, but because I planned ahead I was penalized. I will never fly Alaska again.

### "check-in will be extra slow"
My wife, son and I were all flying from Seattle to different locations. I had a United flight with checked bags at 7:10am. My wife and son had an Alaska Airlines flight at 7:20am, with no checked bags. We were both in the airport at 6am. I didn't miss my flight, my wife and son missed their flight. Reason? Long, slow check-in process of Alaska. Security check was not the problem because we went to premium security check-in line. However the Alaska customer service person did try to use that as an excuse. According to Alaska, they "give each passenger their fair time". Meaning, they go slow at check-in. Beware people. Alaska check-in will be extra slow.

### "do not fly Alaska Airlines"
We booked 2 premium tickets several months before our flight. We were notified the day before our departure that they changed planes and put us in basic economy seats. We called airline to have our premium seats restored but they couldn't accommodate us as they had upgraded other economy seat holders to premium seats and there were none left that were together. This airline actually upgraded economy seat holders and screwed us out of our premium seats with no compensation other than to refund us our upgrade charge for premium seating. Unless you want to get treated badly by this airline (and who would want to), do not fly Alaska Airlines.

### "yelled at by 3 rude employees"
Salt Lake City to Seattle. Within 30 seconds I walked into the airport I was yelled at by 3 rude employees. They all directed me into three different lines and could not decide which line I needed to be in. They did not accommodate the fact I had an infant and made things more difficult for me to check in. Overall I will be flying any airline but this one from now on.

### "adopt better customer service"
Santa Ana to Seattle. Alaska has been my least favorite airline, and I was concerned when I realized that’s who my husband had booked our trip through. It’s highly irritating that they charge for every checked bag. Our flight was delayed 3 hours due to a previous passenger having flushed a diaper down the toilet, which disabled the entire lavatory system. I realize this issue was out of their hands. When we finally boarded three hours late, my baby, who’d been sleeping and or calm during what should’ve been the entire flight, had absolutely had it. She started fussing, and the youngest woman of our flight attendants started joking with the passengers in front of us that they were all going to need a drink for this flight. I wanted to turn her snack cart over. Are you serious. Later, the same flight attendant stooped down to talk to my baby and said, “You seem happier now, you sure weren’t happy a little while ago!”. Then she conversed with the woman in front of me, sharing that another passenger had been rude to her about the situation, and said, “If you talk to me like that, I’m not going to give you anything, but if you’re nice about it, I will.” She then made a big show about how the seats in front of us were all premium seats which were entitled to free snacks and alcoholic beverages. When people have been stranded at the airport for 3 additional hours due to mechanical issues, the handful of people who were unable to switch flights, and had to struggle on should all get free snacks at the very  least. I felt that this younger woman flight attendant was extremely unprofessional. This airline needs to adopt some better customer service protocol for situations like this.

### "wait 35 mins on the tarmac"
Las Vegas to Los Angeles. Worst experience. 40 minutes flight from Vegas to LA and we had to wait 35 mins on the tarmac - we landed 25 mins early and the gate wasn’t ready. I missed my next flight. I’ll try to avoid next time.

### "kindness and compassion"
Not Verified |  Honolulu to Seattle. I just wanted to give a shout out to the amazing pilot on AS 852 from Honolulu to Seattle. I am a breast cancer survivor that takes Tamoxifen. My medication makes me very nauseous sometimes and unfortunately I vomited right before taking off. The crew was concerned for the safety and health of the other passengers so we went back to the gate. Needless to say I was very embarrassed. I was asked to get off the plane and had concerns due to the fact that I had an 8 year old at home that had no care the following day. The pilot came out and introduced himself. When I told him the story and he saw that I was doing fine he became an amazing advocate for me. Although the plane was now delayed 2 hours, because of him, I was able to get back on and he even made sure I made my connecting flight. I appreciate his kindness and compassion. It is crew like him that makes me travel with Alaska Airlines time and time again.

### "zero effort to assist"
Denver to Wenatchee via Seattle. Two hour flight delay getting out of Denver caused the three of us to miss the Alaska connection near midnight in Seattle. No effort was made by Alaska to assist us with our travels. They simply automatically booked us for midnight of the following day, leaving us to spend 24 hours in Seattle/Tacoma Airport. I understand delays happen but there was zero effort to assist or compensate for this debacle. Seeing this I rented a car and carried the three of us home to Wenatchee at 3am. The following day (as usual) a long conversation with "customer care" resulted in disclaimer after disclaimer of their responsibilities. In the end, after having paid for this flight with money and miles I was "refunded" 3000 miles per ticket. Note that the cost of this ticket is over twice this amount. So in the end Alaska has three empty seats for which I paid most of the fare. Alaska Airlines is the epitome of corporate greed. They fein concern for the flying public, but they monetize every little thing that they can and it's all on your head. Greedy Alaska Airlines! !

### "pay for sitting together"
Got stuck for an extra 2 hours due to an issue with the plane. The staff was polite, but the time they got back to us for food for purchase, they were out. The response from the staff was that we should have pre booked food, because obviously we should have been able to predict the future to know our 5 hour flight was  going to be 7 hours. On the way back they are refusing to assign myself and my 6 year old. Apparently the airline policy is only children 2 and under are assured to sit with a parent. Otherwise they try their best, or force families to pay more money for the “privilege” of sitting together.

### "abuses its passengers"
New York to Los Angeles. We traveled with a baby on flight AS1407 on April 15, 2019. The flight was delayed by 13 hours and 25 minutes because the pilot was not able to fly and there was no crew available to replace him. From the beginning of the delay the treatment of the crew was denigrating. They announced by megaphone that they were going to give us a lunch and dinner at the airport establishments with a maximum of $12 per person. When people complained for only 12 dollars, they announced through the megaphone that we were lucky because they were not required by law to give us two meals, they should only provide us one meal, and they said with ironic tone that the second was courtesy. Finally, during the flight, the crew did not offer water to the passengers either. Under European law we would have been entitled to approximately 600 euros per person, but under US law we were not entitled to any compensation. They knew that we had no right to anything and that is why they mistreated us. It is a company that abuses its passengers, company completely not recommended.

### "I do not recommend"
Seattle to Dallas Ft Worth. Worst experience! Sat on 2 different planes for an hour at the gate for the same flight. First time was to find out that our plane was not safe to fly in. The second one after moving terminals and waiting to board again, sat in plane another hour and counting while waiting for fuel. Still currently sitting at gate. Passengers had to ask attendants why we were still not moving. I do not recommend using this airline

### "best flying experience"
San Francisco to Newark. I had to check in my second bag at the last second and I was impressed by the customer service. Staff were courteous, humorous and helpful all while wearing a genuine smile. This is the best flying experience I had and a great way to start my trip to New York and Africa. Thank you Alaska Airlines for the phenomenal service, you have a new repeat flyer.

### "last time was by far the worst"
Los Angeles to Honolulu. I've flown on Alaska air several times. This last time was by far the worst. I booked a first class ticket and was bumped to premium class, because they don't allow more than one pet in first class. I made sure to ask before I even booked my ticket. The guy at the gate was extremely rude, and threatened to hold me back. The worst part is that it's been almost a month, and I still haven't heard from customer service regarding the refund I've requested for the price difference between first class and premium. The last guy I spoke to, said that they had no evidence that I had been moved. He said that they'd have to speak to the flight attendants to corroborate my story. There were a few people who were very kind and helpful. The woman who checked me in, the two woman who wheeled me to the plane, and one flight attendant.

### "ridiculous customer service"
Not Verified |  San Jose to San Diego. Worst airline ever. Absolutely ridiculous customer service and failure to plan. Flight was delayed by 12 hours for maintenance, and they informed us in increments of 1 hour. I'm in full support of safety, but what maintenance takes 12-13 hours? Cancel the flight if the repair will take that long. Our flight time was only 1 hr. No consideration for the customers. Should have canceled the flight instead of delaying for an absurd amount of time. Extremely poor planning. The delay caused me to have to pay for an extra day of dog boarding, and the POS management team did not want to reimburse. Poor excuse of an airline.

### "fantastic experience flying"
Baltimore to San Fransisco. Katy was wonderful on flight 1127. Most fantastic experience flying in years! Would absolutely recommend to any traveler. I felt at ease in the air and almost didn’t want the flight to end. I am so thankful for my flight and I hope others experience the same blessed feelings I had flying Alaska airlines.

### "took forever to take off"
Not Verified |  Spokane to Las Vegas. We sat in the back of the plane, where we have sat many many times on other airlines. The flight attendants were speaking so loudly in their personal conversations that I could hear nothing else even over at the roar of the jet engines. I was highly dissatisfied at that the only beverages they offered were water or Orange juice. And no snack. Which sounds petty but we paid hundreds of dollars for this one flight. After we switched planes for the 2nd part of our trip it took forever for the plane to take off we were literally sitting on the plane for 45 minutes before the flight took off. Also, deboarding the plane was not organized and did not happen in a timely manner. I'm pretty sure the reason they guarantee your bags will be waiting for you at baggage claim is because you cannot get off the plane fast enough. Bags have priority over passengers.

### "they never would respond"
Anchorage to Seattle via Houston. Horrible flight (rerouted with a 3 hour bus ride to Houston) followed up by lost package and never got any customer service. My Reference# was passed from one agent to another until they quit responding to phone calls (you can only get them during certain parts of the day in Houston) and my emails. After a year I quit as they never would respond.

### "lack of customer service"
Seattle to Washington. My luggage did not make it on board my flight. Despite a 5 hour flight, I wasn't told this until after I waited in baggage pick up at DCA. Apparently, they knew it wasn't coming with me and said it was sent to the wrong flight in SEA and after they realized it my flight to DCA had already departed. I was then told that my luggage would be sent on the next cross country flight on 3/27 and would be delivered to my home after 4:30 p.m. This was the first time I had flown Alaska and was unimpressed when the agent at DCA dismissed my concerns and said "this happens all the time. She offered miles, which I did not want. I got a call the next day around 5 p.m. saying the luggage arrived and would be delivered to my home. I again told the agent I did not want "miles" since I didn't have a rewards program but I wanted a refund of my baggage check fees, at a minimum. She couldn't authorize and said she would make note of it. I then got an email stating that it would be delivered by 11:36 p.m. I was already tired from losing sleep from the late flight the day before, time changes, and due to jet lag but I knew I had to wait up for the luggage. The luggage was delivered at 1:31 AM on 3/28! I waited up to sign and make sure it was my actual luggage; however, it was dropped in my driveway in front of my garage. I didn't know it arrived until I got an email at 1:32 am. I am unimpressed by Alaska and will avoid flying them again at all costs. I am especially unimpressed by the lack of customer service, inability to deliver what is promised, and dismissive attitudes.

### "flight departures late
Seattle to Portland. Horrible customer service and always this flight departures late. Alaska air line is going really bad. I have had so many bad experiences and delayed flights.

### "Plane was delayed 2 hours"
San Francisco to Kansas City. I doubt I will ever use Alaska Airlines again. I have never had any problems with Southwest, but this airline was cheaper so I went with it. Plane was delayed 2 hours, and then once it “got” to the airport it was delayed another 30 minutes before even landing because it wasn’t authorized to land yet. We will have to wait another 30-45 minutes for them to clean the plane and take off. In total, I will have sat at the airport for 3.5 hours waiting for this plane. Never again. I recommend going with another airline.

### "Will use Alaska again"
Not Verified |  Was flying out of Albuquerque NM but due to a power outage at the airport my flight was cancelled. Called customer care the rep was super nice but she couldnt get me on a flight out that day. I went ahead and did a full refund. Later I needed an email stating they couldn't get me out to San Diego that day to get refunded on my room. Called customer care and got Tawnya she was so nice and told me no problem and wrote me an email with the info I needed. Thank you so much! Will use Alaska again.

### "I prefer Alaska"
Not Verified |  I’m flying often between Los Angeles - New York - Fort Lauderdale - Miami and sometimes using Alaska. Comparing to United I prefer Alaska. The seat comfort, service is much better, they also always got a vegetarian options for the meal, the food selection is way better. The negative aspects are - the WiFi is not always working, sometimes not at all, seats are old sometimes, but never had a problem with plugging; between other US airlines I prefer Alaska!

### "incredibly frustrating experience"
My recent travel with Alaska Airlines has been an incredibly frustrating experience. My family (3yo, 8yo and two parents) were travelling from Bellingham via SeaTac to Orange County. We were delayed in getting there, and cancelled many times coming back due to weather. Alaska typically cancelled with short to no notice (even after a five hour wait at the airport) and rescheduled us to flights that were undesirable. We finally got home (three days after schedule) on another airline and by renting a car because Alaska wasn't able to get us to our destination. After coming home attempting to get a refund for the flight we never took was next to impossible. Every time I called the person on the phone said the previous agent hadn't done what they needed to do and my file had gone nowhere. I've had to call SIX times to now get a completely different answer about how I will get my refund (over a month after the non-flight). I've also filed a complaint through their website with no response. My overall experience is that I've gotten variable information from almost every agent I've spoken to, and have experienced a lack of responsiveness for my concerns. I don't plan on flying with Alaska again and would not recommend their services.

### "Never will I fly Alaska again"
I flew with my two children, ages 5 and 9 on a pre-booked flight with assigned seats from Newark to LAX. The flight was cancelled but automatically re-scheduled for same time the next day. We were given 3 seat assignments, all of us separated from one another. The ticketing agent told me there was nothing she could do because it was overbooked but to tell the gate agents. I did and they refused to seat us together on the 6 hour cross-country flight, but were happy to add stand-by passengers to the flight and offered to try to seat them all together! I then asked the flight attendants who nastily also refused. I pleaded with them that my kids were too young, esp, my 5 year old, to sit without me, and with strangers for this long flight. They rudely told me tough luck. I was panicking then, but I knew it was best to stay calm and polite. When I asked again, the agent told me that I might prefer de-planing and explaining my problem to TSA. It was exasperating. The Alaska Newark crew - all of them at the gate and in the plane - were nasty, taking advantage of post-911 TSA threats for any reason. I wrote a letter when we returned and got a canned response--with $75 vouchers which are absolutely useless - you can't use them for regularly priced tickets. If I wanted to buy a $2000 one hour flight which is priced at $49 by Southwest, the vouchers work. Never used these and when I told them about this, they offered me a few thousand miles instead - also worthless but also so I am forced to fly with them again. Not only were my complaints not adequately addressed, they get me to spend more money with them. I wouldn't take it--I would rather they lose my business for life. How do you separate a mother and both of her two young children on a 6 hour flight, and also threaten to de-plane us all because I was distressed? They threatened me because they could. I did my part by pre-booking and getting assigned seats. Never will I fly Alaska again. No matter what.

### "Hooray to Alaska Airlines"
Not Verified |  Unfortunately, the plane that we were taking had some mechanical problems when it landed from the flight right before us. Not knowing the extent of the repair, they had us all board and then realized that it was going to take longer than they anticipated to fix. So, the captain came out and told us what the problem was and then told us that we could get off of the plane and wait in the boarding areas. Of course, no one was happy about the delay -- BUT, Alaska did everything they could to make our 4.5 hour delay bearable. They gave us meal vouchers to use in the airport ($12 each) and issued each passenger a $100 discount code to be used in the next year. While we waited not knowing what to expect, the airlines and the gate personnel were amazing about keeping us updated. They even took our cell numbers in case we wanted to venture away from the gate areas to personally call with updates. We got regular texts from the airlines - and constant smiles and apologies from the staff. One of the gate personnel, Tiffany, went over and above to make us all feel cared about. She even took our 11 month old grandson and played with him for a little bit to help keep him occupied (at this point, he was already bored with us). We lost 1/2 day in San Diego - but, that's one of the risks of air travel. Hooray to Alaska Airlines and their staff for going out of their way to make a bad situation better!

### "never fly Alaska again"
Los Angeles to New York. I will never fly Alaska again! This is my second time flying with them and sad to say I didn’t learn from the first time around when they ran out of snacks/drinks back in Jan 2018 only 30 mins into the flight. This time around I wasn’t able to chose my seat so upon arriving to the gate I went up three different times and was told to wait but I was just requesting a seat not in the middle and the lady pretty much kept yessing me to death and ended up putting me in a middle seat in the last row. I will never fly this airline again.

### "It was bad"
Not Verified | Boise to Honolulu. It was bad! Our flight got cancelled with no other flights available until 3-5 days later! We all needed to get home that next day but they had no other way for us to leave. We were checked into a hotel with no shuttle early enough for our trip to the airport and they gave us food vouchers that didn’t supply enough money for a meal.

### "this lady was amazing"
Seattle to Vancouver. This review is for Trish, Seattle airport customer service), this lady was amazing. She helped me find another flight after I missed my flight to Calgary, it took her about 45 min between calls and holds by she was very patient to get me the best flight without much wait, Thank you Alaska for hiring employee like her.

### "never fly with them again"
Not Verified |  San Francisco to New Orleans. The flight was severely delayed (5 hours) due to inadequate staffing and disorganization. No meal vouchers or other compensation were offered. This happened on two flights in one week with this airline. I will never fly with them again.

### "never be flying Alaska Air again"
Los Angeles to Chicago. After checking in online and receiving an electronic boarding pass we tried to board the plane to be told we had to go back to the desk. We had booked premium seats and already paid the upgrade. At the desk we were told "NO I DONT HAVE THAT HERE" and the rude woman on the desk would not listen or look at the booking receipt we had. We were told there was never a 17C seat in premium (despite my boarding pass and email confirmation). We were not the only ones, some people from First Class and others from Premium had the same issue and we were all put in economy and handed a number to call "take it up with them". Appalling customer service. We all boarded the flight and sat on the tarmac for over two and a half hours. There were no pilots to fly the plane. Why they let us board and sit there in the heat is unacceptable. The crew informed us at the end the ground staff knew there was a plane change and kept all the crew in the dark so they would keep us all on the plane. Just confirms they are a terrible company to work for with a real lack of respect for their employees. This morning after complaining I was offered initially a $75 credit each towards a flight for the 2 bookings. I had to tell them I wanted the money for the upgrade back as I did not receive that service. They couldn't find anything about the upgrade? after I said I can send you the email booking which clearly shows the upgrade charges did they offer the refund. Shame on you Alaska Airlines. Its pretty clear all the positive reviews are Virgin America which they bought out. I certainly will never be flying Alaska Air again.

### "can’t serve us any alcohol"
Honolulu to Los Angeles. Had the worse experience ever! I fly 5-6 times a month (not with Alaska Airlines) And this flight was so bad that I can’t pass on it. Our flight attendant was very rude. We came back from Honolulu to Los Angeles and my girlfriend had a headache when we enter the plane, so I asked for a cup of water. The flight attendant said she can serve drinks only after we take off. It tonight it’s the policy, but meanwhile she could sneak drinks and snacks to her girlfriend that was sitting next to us. When I complained to her, the flight attendant was rude, she ignored us and even refused to take our trash when she picked up for the rest of the passengers. After all of that, when I asked someone else from the crew for an alcoholic beverage, she said that she can’t serve us any alcohol drinks (because we asked for water when we enter and it means we are sick!) I upgraded our seats to premium sitting because the drinks are included (cost me an extra $200), and we didn’t get any drinks at this flight. I felt so uncomfortable and so embarrassed with the way the flight attendant treated us, and I demand will never fly with them again!

### "flight home is canceled"
Ontario to Seattle. Bought round trip tickets to CA. Had to leave a day early. Alaska Air says “No Changes”, buy new 1-Way tickets to CA on earlier day. Alaska Air says “you didn’t make 1st part on round trip, so now flight home is canceled!” New flight $449 per person for trip home.

### "told that we cannot change"
We used miles and bought two tickets from SJC to Ft Lauderdale Florida. the return rout was from FFL at 8:55 am to LAX then to Oregon then to san Jose arriving at 9:40 PM. When we arrived in LAX around 11:30 we found out there is a direct flight from LAX to San Jose at 12:40 and there were just 45 passengers on the plain, after calling to change it to earlier flight, we were told that we cannot change it because we have purchased our ticket using miles and this is considered low fare. It took us 15 hours to get home vs 7 hours just because we used our miles to buy the ticket! Basically, their mileage plan is garbage, and they have a very rude and arrogant customer service.

### "Starting to hate Alaska"
Portland to San Francisco. Starting to hate Alaska I have flown 6 times to SFO on Alaska Since November. On my last trip I paid $497 for this two hour trip still I wound up in the back of the plane. I actually sat next to someone who paid $80 for their flight. This time I got a saver fare but I was not given a seat assignment so we called airlines who said I could pay $35 for a seat Or if I waited one hour before check in I would be assigned. That’s exactly what happened so I got my boarding pass and was assigned row 19. Right before boarding the gate attendant called me up by microphone and then dressed me down saying not to get a seat assignment in the future because I had a saver fare which means I’m only allowed middle seat and boarding last. So embarrassing. I’m flying another airline from now on.

### "worst flight I have been on"
Not Verified |  This airline is terrible. I flew in premium class row 6F and I found out for a bag of popcorn it was $2.50 and there are no TVs instead you have to use your own device or either rent a tablet for more money. And to make things worse there was no meal service and this was a 4.5 hour flight that took off from Seattle for Newark and all I had was a bagel and a coffee before the flight. This is the worst flight I have ever been on, never going to fly Alaska airlines again.

### "avoid this airline"
This is probably one of the worst airlines I have traveled with when it comes to customer service. And since my beloved daughter keeps buying me the ticket to come visit her, I keep having to fly with them. But oh my goodness have I had it! This is the second time that my daughter has had to change my flight and they suggest her "best" option is a way where she not only ends up paying the $125 (I think) change fee, but also ends up buying a whole new ticket! And this time, today, when she tried to call and cancel twenty minutes after buying the new ticket, they told her she had to pay again to cancel her brand new purchase! This is the only airline I've hear charges you to cancel a purchase within 24 hours. The attitude she got not only from the customer service agent, but from the manager who was nothing but a waste of time. She told my daughter she "had to listen to the recording of her request to make sure what had happened, and then she would call her back". Really? Please! Do yourself a favor and avoid this airline. The so called lower fares are not worth dealing with a bunch of "agents" that have zero intention in offering any customer service. The only thing in their minds is how can they get more money out of you. This is the second time in 3 months they do this to my daughter. This time it hit me hard because my daughter just had a baby, they just left the hospital after having the baby in the NICU for a whole week and she really needed my help for a longer period of time. So we have to suck it up with Alaska getting away once again with their ridiculous ways.

### "Worst customer service"
San Jose to Newark. Worst customer service I have come across in a long time. The absolute lack of communication after delaying a flight 7 hours. No offer of hotel or accommodation. Only to show up next day to another delayed flight. Customer care was off for the holiday.

### "these guys are very disorganized"
Spokane to Seattle. We waited for two hours while they were fixing the plane. Meanwhile they were sending other passengers going to the same place with a later flight time ahead of us. I think these guys are very disorganized!! They could have put us on that plane after us. They fly every hour. Thanks to them we missed our international flight with no refund. I hope I never have to use Alaska again. I will rate it 1 because I can't go any lower.

### "poor service overall"
San Diego to Honolulu. I would not recommend this airline to anyone. If flying to Hawaii, use Hawaiian airlines. A 6 hour flight and they only serve sandwiches and platters that you have to pay for. They also charge for screen use for entertainment. Not to mention the delay in flight without notice, and it took them over an hour to deplane us once we reached our destination airport with no explanation given within the first hour! The flight attendants were rude at times, and there was poor service overall.

### "a credit to Alaska Airlines"
Seattle to Vancouver. While I was waiting in Seattle for my flight 2314 and I was watching a member of staff as the people went through his line up at the counter. I have to say that the way in which he treated everyone especially the children, was terrific. He talked to them, gave them eye to eye contact, he bent down to talk to the littler ones, and he even picked up things when they dropped them. When we treat them with respect, they don't forget that. Thanks Dave, you are a credit to Alaska Airlines!

### "the worst travel experience"
Seattle to Spokane. This was by far and away the worst travel experience I’ve ever had. Our flight was delayed then eventually cancelled - though all along they kept telling us our flight would eventually take-off. Not only were we (including my wife & two young children) left stranded without any good options to get home, the agents were rude & came across as if they could’ve cared less. I will never book Alaska airlines again, if I can help it (& would strongly advise you consider other options - especially if traveling with a young family). Customer service was horrendous.

### "poor info on closet availability"
Not Verified |  Chicago to Los Angeles. Very poor info given on closet availability. Was traveling with a wedding dress and was told by the woman working the gate to tell the flight attendant when we got on the plane. Only to be told that there was no closet on the plane! Poor communication.

### "felt like complete incompetence"
We had such an unnecessarily difficult trip today (actually spanning 2 days). On our way to the East coast from Kauai, our aircraft was diverted to Honolulu because they needed to refuel. This caused us to be over an hour late to land in Seattle. This in itself is always frustrating, but sometimes uncontrollable. The biggest (one of many) frustration was that the airline knew before we boarded. It is nearly impossible for us to catch another flight our of Seattle, but very easy out of Kauai or Honolulu. Alaska could have proactively helped the 20 passengers connecting to the same destination before we left for Seattle. Not only that, they failed to hold a plane 2 gates over for those same 20 customers. It would have taken no time for us to move planes after we docked at the arrival gate 10 minutes before the other plane pulled back from the gate. Then, we dealt with a mess of customer service to rebook, and then, after all of that, they couldn't manage to get our bag to our final destination. I only booked this flight because of Alaska's reputation, but I will never book again. There was no service excellence and it felt like complete incompetence the entire trip.

### "I would totally recommend"
Los Angeles to New York. This was the first time me and my family flew on Alaska airlines and was very impressed. We had 4 kids and our youngest was 2 years old. Everything from checking in to our journey to New York was fantastic with great service we received form the cabin crew. Want to say a huge thank you to Donna one of the crew members for being so accommodating and helpful especially travelling with 3 young children. I would totally recommend flying with Alaska airplanes. Thanking you

### "assigned me a middle seat"
New York to Seattle. I booked an isle seat, but when I checked in at the airport they assigned me a middle seat. This is unacceptable. I paid extra for the seats.

### "will never fly Alaska again"
Not Verified |  Dallas to Anchorage via Seattle. This was the worst flight experience I’ve had in over 23 years of flying, and that includes military flights. They left us in an airport for 11 hours before cancelling the flight. Luckily after about 8 hours I found a later flight and got on it. They guarantee bags within 20 min, try two days before we saw our bags. Gave us a voucher for our inconvenience to use on a future flight but not any future flights you might have already paid for. How about an upgrade, or a free bag check, nope, there is nothing they will do. Then they sat on the tarmac for 20 min waiting on another plane to leave our terminal at 11 pm. We will never fly Alaska again.

### "Stay away from this airline"
Not Verified |  Boarded Alaskan Air in Spokane, Washington on Monday Feb 4 at 12:55 Pm arrived in Reno February 5 and were able to leave the airport at 7pm. This would have been A 12 hour drive. Our skis took another day. We dealt with numerous Alaskan Agents in Spokane, Seattle, Portland and Reno. Most were not in the slightest concerned that people were waiting for hours or days. Two were apologetic but defeated and exhausted, One was competent. The vast majority were slow and totally unconcerned about the chaos engulfing their Headquarters and other airports of the carrier. Stay away from this airline, cancellations can come at any time with no reasons given. Late departures seem to be the norm. No one cares about passengers.

### "your seat is not guaranteed"
Not Verified |  Baltimore to Los Angeles. I selected seating and paid, used the saver package. Saver stands for saving the stressful mess days/hours before your scheduled flight. I literally got an email 2 days before leaving that said my money for my seat selections had been refunded because I chose the saver package. I called and they stated we will get seated when we get there. Why allow someone to pay for a seat when someone can come along and literally pay more and take your seats. If that’s how saver works then an option to pay for your seat shouldn’t be availabe. You should be told that you can’t select a seat to pay for because your seat is not guaranteed and you will be seated once you arrive at the airport. It’s ridiculous. After this flight I will never ever fly with Alaska again.

### "slow and totally unconcerned"
Not Verified | Spokane to Reno. Boarded Alaska Airlines in Spokane on Monday Feb 4 at 12:55 Pm arrived in Reno February 5 and were able to leave the airport at 7pm. This would have been a 12 hour drive. Our skis took another day. We dealt with numerous Alaska Agents in Spokane, Seattle, Portland and Reno. Most were not in the slightest concerned that people were waiting for hours or days. Two were apologetic but defeated and exhausted, One was competent. The vast majority were slow and totally unconcerned about the chaos engulfing their headquarters and other airports of the carrier. Stay away from this airline, cancellations can come at any time with no reasons given. Late departures seem to be the norm. No one cares about passengers.

### "connecting flight cancelled"
Sacramento to Edmonton via Portland/Seattle. I will never be flying with this airline again. My party of four got to Portland only to find out that our connecting flight to Seattle was cancelled meaning we wouldn’t be able to make it back to Edmonton. After waiting for almost an hour we got to talk to a representative. They were nice but not at all helpful because our party had to be split up and half of us had to stay overnight in Vancouver and half flew took a different flight. I triple check to ensure that my sister who I was traveling with and my luggage ended up in Vancouver with us and I was assured that it would be there for us to pick up. We flew Air Canada which was delayed by 2 hours. Once we landed we went to baggage claim only to find out that our luggage isn’t there. Once we start asking around we find out that Alaska Airlines never handed our bags over and so we have no idea where our bags are. I call the Alaska Airlines to figure this out only to be put on hold for 25 minutes and be scolded and talked down to because “I should be greatful that they even accommodated me and switched my flights.” When they were the ones that cancelled it in the first place. Then I ask where exactly is my bag and get the run around again only to be told it could be in Portland or in Vancouver somewhere or it might even be in Edmonton now. I then asked ok if it is in Edmonton now as you said it could be what’s stopping someone from taking my bag before I get there tomorrow?! And she said “Well we don’t know if it’s there so you need to file a baggage claim. And you know what they accommodated you and so you should be happy about that.” Needless to say they were not helpful at all. Split up our party and gave me the run around. Not impressed at all. I would not recommend this airline at all.

### "for this pleasant experience"
My husband and I had the best experience with customer service at Dallas International airport and the Alaska Airlines staff. They were able to accommodate our flight and even went a step further and accommodate our seats so we could sit together without any cost. I was not able to get the woman's name who helped us but I wanted to make sure her supervisor knows that she was exceptional! She was at the E11 gate at the Dallas international airport on February 4, 2019 at 2pm when flight 655 to Portland was boarding. Thanks for this pleasant experience!

### "a miserable experience"
Not Verified |  Baltimore to Los Angeles. I chose them because a search online had them rated by customers as the best airline. After one flight yesterday, I disagree! First, I paid extra to be able to choose my seat, but at no time during the booking or pre-flight did I get to do that. Secondly, there was less room per passenger than on any other flight I've ever been on! The bag that always fits under the seat, would not because there simply isn't as much room under there as on other planes. I suspect the seats are narrower! I had a rude man sitting next to me who would not get his elbows out of my space. We had words, and an elbow shoving turf war went down! He seemed to think that since he'd sat down first, he had claim to whatever space he could take and hold onto. I was incredulous, the manners missing from this guy. But seeking to avoid a fistfight with him right there, I was able to call in an attendant who had another seat I could move to. What a miserable experience! I will be very surprised if I ever use this airline again.

### "what customer service should be"
Not Verified |  Denver to Seattle. A huge thank you to the woman in reservations who worked with me to get on a last minute flight. You are what customer service should be and deserve recognition. The woman at the gate however, barely looked up at me, told me “nothing i can do” and continued to count down to closing the doors

### "nothing we can do"
Spokane to Seattle. Horrible airline. Every single time I’ve had an issue with my flight, bags or anything they basically say “nothing we can do”, I was recently severely injured and couldn’t fly due to my injuries. Alaska would not refund my flight, would not do anything to understand my situation. They ended up giving me a “discount code” which didn’t do anything because I had to pay a fee for canceling my flight, and then had to pay for an entirely new plane ticket. I ended up paying over $300 for a 30 minute flight. When I tried to discuss with the woman how in no way this could’ve been planned she said “things happen everyday”. I have been a loyal customer of Alaska for years. I have used them as connecting flights for international trips and small trips in the USA and when I get injured they don’t have the decency to at least give me a credit or swap the flights! (Mind you these flights leave every 30 min). I offered to send them copies of my medical papers to show I wasn’t lying and they still didn’t budge.

### "Last time flying with them"
Newark to San Francisco. The flight was 4 hours late. The cabin was freezing and uncomfortably so (this is despite socks, sweater and coat. No blankets available. For a 6 hour flight they could have provided more than 2 cookies. Horrible. First time flying with them. Last time I will be flying with them.

### "nice flight as usual"
Seattle to Phoenix. Such a nice flight as usual, very professional flight attendants and the meals has improved a lot. Entertainment systems were very nice as usual and I think the connection is more stabilized than before.

### "she already closed the gate"
Seattle to Philadelphia. Everyone is aware that TSA lines are long during the government shutdown. But Alaska Airlines still closes their boarding doors 10 - 15 minutes early. I got through the long security line and made it to the gate on time for my flight. The ticket agent proudly told me that she already closed the gate so that the “flight could be early.” I spoke with another traveler who said they closed the door right in front of her and refused to let her board.

### Alaska Airlines customer review
Seattle to Oakland, Checking weather reports before our Alaska Horizon Flight 2258 departed SeaTac, we knew we would be arriving into Oakland the same time as a rainstorm with high winds. Heartfelt thanks to the pilot and copilot for landing the plane as winds buffetted the approach. Good job pilots.

### "awful traveling experience"
Maui to Seattle. In the three seats directly behind me, there were 3 children and their mom. One child was young enough to ride on his mom's lap instead of being belted into a seat. When we are all cautioned to stay buckled up because of turbulence, a child is sitting on his mom's lap and the attendants tell her to tightly hang on to him? That seems really ineffective. The child not assigned to a seat was behind me on the floor, opening and closing the tray over and over and pushing against my seat. When he was forced to sit on his mom's lap, he screamed a high pitch scream continuously. My question is: why aren't families with young children assigned to the first row so they do not sit directly behind someone? I was not unsympathetic to the mom. She was doing her best. But it was a really awful traveling experience. I did ask an attendant if there was another seat in the cabin and there wasn't.

### ""saver fares are an absolute joke"
Not Verified |  I am  disappointed and frustrated with Alaska Airlines. Their "saver" fares are an absolute joke. I booked my flight less that 48 hours ago and found out the wrong day had been booked for a flight in mid-February. I called right away about changing the flight only to find out that there was absolutely nothing that could be done. There is no credit available, it is non-refundable and non-changeable after 24 hours. Their "saver" flights are supposed be cheap flights but in the end cost me almost double because of their restrictive policy. Stay away from their "saver" flights... Not worth it!

### "put off of our flight home"
My Emotional Support dogs and I were put off of our flight home this evening because I warned the flight attendant that my dog would cry once I zipped the carrier. Neither of my dogs made a peep during the whole fiasco. The flight attendant called the supervisor to come "tell me the rules". I have 100% legal documentation for both dogs, which was provided to Alaska Airlines when we flew out to Seattle, when they let both of my dogs fly as Emotional Support Animals. After being put off the plane, the Customer Service Agent told me to falsify documentation so that both dogs could fly. I found this to be stellar information provided to a travel nurse who was merely trying to go back home. The worst part, as if the whole situation isn't bad enough, is that my grown daughter was flying with me, and was holding one of the dogs which I paid the $100 pet in cabin fee for. Good thing tomorrow is Monday and I can go have a doctor falsify those records for me so the dogs and I can go home. It actually pains me that Alaska Airlines is forcing me to be unethical just so I can get back home.

### "overall very good flight"
New York to San Francisco. Very nice and same business class - 8 seat total. Seat layout is 2X2 with elective seat with massage and full functions and personal TV screen. service was very good and professional, food was ok, free Wifi works well and overall very good flight!

### "professionalism, caring attitudes"
I recently retired and began my 5 year voyage around the world by starting off on flight 895 from San Diego to Honolulu. However, my travels are, and will be very complicated, because my small companion dog will be accompanying me. Three locations on my trip have strict quarantine requirements beginning with Hawaii. Alaska Airlines is currently the only airline that accommodates a "pet in cabin" to the 50th state from the mainland. (The other airlines serving Hawaii, including Alaska Airlines, allow "certified" support animals - for which there were two on my flight. While my beloved dog is like a child to me, I could not in all honesty, use this option.) From the initial reservations call to book my pet in cabin reservation, to the arrival in Honolulu, Alaska Airlines has been wonderful, making my trip as easy as possible. Airport personnel in San Diego and Honolulu, as well as the inflight crew, have my utmost appreciation for their professionalism, caring attitudes, and quality of services. Until this recent trip, it's been quite a while since flew with Alaska Airlines as my past recent travels were nearly all transcontinental. But they will definitely have my future business whenever I need to fly on a route that they serve. Thank you Alaska Airlines

### "have to pay a fee for internet"
Not Verified |  Denver to Seattle. I find it to be absurd that in 2018, you pay for First Class seating and still have to pay a fee for internet usage. Really? First class on Alaska Air,  where drinks are free, but there's still an additional fee for the internet. So incredibly lame.

### "worst customer service"
San Francisco to New York. Even though I’m an Alaska elite member, these past few weeks I experienced the worst customer service ever. It made me miss Southwest (and that’s saying something). Two weeks ago my flight was delayed 3 hours, which Alaska didn’t inform us about until after we arrived at the airport. No worries (I thought) Alaska will compensate me. I had to contact them multiple times and all they have ever offered was a $100 voucher. My flight today is delayed over 1.5 hours. I call (mainly to inquire about my other delayed flight) and ask if there’s any upgrade options. The customer service rep abruptly told me “we don’t compensate anything unless you’re at least 2 hours delayed.” Needless to say, I miss the old Alaska. I miss the old Virgin America. This new company is destined to lose its many loyal elite customers.

### "it was an outstanding service"
This was my first time flying with Alaska Airlines and I must say that it was an outstanding service. From checkin to inflight, it was amazing. The star though goes to the check in agent in Vegas. She was super friendly and extremely professional. I would fly Alaska Airlines again. The only downfall was that WiFi was not working but it was a short flight and there was also an obnoxious passenger talking loudly. However that’s not the fault of the airline.

### "not had the appropriate supplies"
Las Vegas to San Francisco. The plane did not have head sets for sale or for handout. This is not the first time that an Alaska flight has not had the appropriate supplies for my flight experience. I get the feeling that there is a disconnect between the supply teams and the flights. Someone is not taking the appropriate inventory of what is needed per flight. This should never be an issue. Especially not for a passenger flying in first class. On a positive note, one of your flight crew let me borrow his phone charger to charge my phone while I was on the flight. Also, I noticed that there was major wear and tear on the plane in the front seat wall that needs to be taken care of. It is not acceptable of a first class isle. I really enjoyed Virgin America before Alaska bought them out. I just hope the quality of Virgin America isn’t lost because Alaska Airlines doesn’t make the little things a priority anymore.

### "Very poor customer service"
St Louis to Ketchikan via Seattle. Very poor customer service. I have two main issues; first, they lost my luggage. Second, on the leg back their stewardess did not show up and my flight was delayed by more than 24 hours. They were unwilling to put me on a partner airline, due to cost obviously. I will not use their services unless absolutely required and I have been very disappointed with their customer service. I would recommend Delta, who fly many of the same routes in the PNW.

### "will avoid flying with Alaska"
Vancouver to Bozeman via Seattle. I will avoid flying with Alaska if possible from now on. My flight from Vancouver to Seattle was delayed. As a result I missed my connecting flight home. I realize these things happen when traveling. There was not another flight to my final destination until the next day. This meant I needed to stay overnight in Seattle. When I asked for a hotel voucher they told me that the delay was not their fault, and because it wasn’t their fault I was responsible for a hotel. This is simply bad business. It may not have been within Alaska airlines control that the plane was late, however they are responsible for my travel. And when something went wrong, instead of accommodating a paying customer, they pushed the blame on someone else and stuck me with the bill. The hotel ended up costing me 130 usd. When I bought my tickets there was a untied flight and a delta flight for 30 dollars more. Seeing as how this flight actually ended up being 100 dollars more than the closest competitor with the hotel included I will choose a different airline over Alaska every time from here on out.

### "last time flying Alaska"
I was supposed to fly San Francisco to Las Vegas on 25th November 2018, departing at 5:50pm. As soon as I left for airport at 3:50pm I checked for the status and it was delayed by almost 2 hours (new departure time: 7:38pm). I had just left so we came back home. I then left for the airport at 6pm. At 6:09pm I got a notification that it is now departing at 7:12pm. Unfortunately there was a crash on the freeway so I could only reach the airport by 6:45pm. I tried speaking to an agent and after 4-5 tries with their automated speech input system I finally got through to an agent. She told me she can put me on a later airline (departing at 9:30pm) but I would have to pay $50, since I should never have turned around, and actually stayed at the airport waiting for the flight to depart. Since I HAD to be in Vegas that night I agreed. When I finally got to the airport and my gate I saw there was another flight #1940 departing at 7:35pm. The agent never even mentioned this airline to me. And to add to my woes, the 9:30pm flight was delayed by almost 45 minutes. we finally landed at 11:40pm, and by the time I got to my hotel it was 1:00am. I had an important meeting at 9am. They changed the flight departure time to be 30 minutes early with just an hour to go. They not only asked me to pay up for their mistakes, but hid info from me about a flight earlier than the 9:30pm one. This not only shows their dishonesty, but also utter disregard for their customers' time. It was my wedding anniversary and I wasted 4 hours away from my husband basically haggling with Alaska to just do their job. Their 9:30 pm flight was delayed as well, for what reason, nobody knows. Even my return flight from Vegas to SFO is delayed by about 30 minutes, and I am here at the airport since 6pm, as per their demand of being 2 hours early. Not just this, my flight from SFO to Seattle last year was delayed 4 times. Even now, when I am just checking their other flights (in case they show their true colors and delay my flight even further) everything is delayed! How can an airline be so incompetent?! They asked me to pay up for their mismanagement, which I find ridiculous. This was my last time flying Alaska. I urge everyone considering them to please take your money elsewhere, at an airline where your time is respected and flights actually leave on time most of the time.

### "airline actually cares"
I just want to say thank you to the kindest airline. I purchased a ticket for my daughter for Thanksgiving and we had a death in the family during Thanksgiving, the second in one year within 4 months of one’s one another and not only did Alaska Airlines express their condolences but they refunded the full ticket for another ticket home. This airline actually cares. Any chance we have to use Alaska Airlines, we will.

### "appreciated the great service"
New York JFK to Los Angeles. I am not a great flyer, although I’ve gotten better lately. This flight had a lot of turbulence, some of the worst I’ve seen on my last ~20 flights. However, the captain and staff on board were so kind and considerate, updating us frequently. It made me much more calm and relaxed. I really appreciated the great service. Thank you!

### "abysmal customer service"
Not Verified |  Arrived at gate 1 hour early. Told by gate agent flight delayed due to delayed inbound flight. Given exact time to return to gate for boarding. Sat down directly opposite to gate, well within range for announcement. Returned to gate at appointed time to board. Doors already closed and no staff at the gate. Sign overhead said "doors closing soon for boarding" but no one was there to serve customers. Found agent at another gate, quickly explained that gate sign indicated that it might still be possible to board. He then took another call while the opportunity to board closed. Went to customer service. Not so much as "gee I'm sorry". Asked if a flight to Sacramento might be available since I could easily drive from there. Customer Service had great difficulty understanding. Said no Alaska flight to Sacramento. Walked down the concourse and immediately found a Sacramento flight ready to board (would been available for rebooking during the timeframe I was talking to Customer Service). Gate agent said he had a seat available but I'd have to go to Customer Service to rebook. Ran back to same Customer Service agent who actually asked me what I was doing there and claimed there were no flights to Sacramento even as her airline was boarding a flight a couple of gates away. Said go back to the gate. I said they told me to come here. She strolled over to the gate. By the time she strolled back it was too late. I've been an Alaska MVP at various levels for more than 35 years. I've sat at many a gate and heard many a gate announcement and occasionally been paged. Hearing my city or name has never failed to get my attention. Heard many another loud announcement while I was sitting there, perhaps 20-30 feet from the gate, but nothing audible for my destination much less my name. Be aware: you may get bad information from Alaska gate agents. You can expect abysmal customer service to redress problems. You may not be able to hear inaudible announcements. Note I'm forced to give stars below in some categories that don't apply since I was left behind and not in a seat etc.

### "could not get wifi to work"
Not Verified |  Flew Alaska Airlines from Portland Oregon to Dallas Texas. First I could not get the wifi to work and the airline server said he didn't know what was wrong with it and was telling someone as we landed that I needed the app. Wondering why the staff were not be able to tell me that or at least work out why I could not connect. The pilot also only said a few words before we took off. No mention about how close we were or when they were going to descend. Never in my life have I had a pilot quite so strange.

### "lost an entire day with family"
Not Verified |  Recently took a trip back home for Thanksgiving, at this point I wish I had stayed home. My flight from Juneau was supposed to leave at 2:24. I arrived at the airport at around noon, with the realization that I would be in the airport for 3 hours (after 2 delays). At the time I was totally fine with this (traveled enough to know). Approximately two hours into my wait I received another notice that the flight would be delayed an additional two hours. I decided to go home and planned to arrive an hour before boarding time. After arriving at the airport I was told that the plane (which was suppose to have arrived in Seattle at 12:00) had not left the airport and another plane was being sent our way. Seven hours after my flight was suppose to depart, we had left the runway. Upon arriving in Seattle we made a phone call to Alaska Airlines about our connecting flight, their response “We don’t know”. After 2 hours of being in Seattle we had received a call from Alaska stating that our connecting flight would not leave until 7:55 (24 hours after our original leave time). At this time we booked a hotel room and an additional car rental (on top of the one we canceled). We arrived at our final destination without any additional complications, but lost an entire day with family and friends for the holidays. The experience did not end here. Upon my journey back home, we had a delay of approximately 1 hour. When we boarded the plane we were told that we had an additional 1 hour and 30 minutes to departure and could leave the plane if we wanted. I am currently sitting in Denver waiting to hear about when we would be boarding, so far all we know is that we will be arriving in Seattle at 10:30 but when we ask when we will be departing we get “I don’t know”. I have been thoroughly disgusted with my travel with Alaska Airlines and will be hesitant to book another flight through them. Side note: we did receive a nice email from an executive stating we would receive $150.00 for our troubles which doesn’t come close to the $1000 we have spent on car rentals, the loss of vacation time from work and time spent with family. If you are looking for a dependable, customer oriented airline look elsewhere.

### "this airline is terrible now"
I guess it must be the Virgin merger/sale but this airline is terrible now. Their planes look like they were bought from Virgin at a bargain sale. They haven't taken the time to remove all the old Virgin decorations, so it's a terrible mix of Alaska's and Virgin and it just feels odd. The seats are poorly arranged which gave a lot of legroom, too much because you couldn't even reach the seat in front of you for the pockets, and there was no room to store your bag under that seat. Seriously, the only way I can explain how bad the plane was is to say it looked like it was bought at a garage sale. Don't expect help from the gate agents, it seems the only requirement for their jobs is apathy. I arrived 10 minutes before the posted time on the gate and they wouldn't let me on the plane. The plane was sitting at the gate as they typed up a new ticket for tomorrow. Other airlines have let me go, or walked me down. I walked away from the Alaska gate staring at the plane sitting at the gate but I couldn't board it. Unfortunately, even airlines like Alaska are realizing that customer service is just not needed for airlines. They know some people will be forced to fly them, or will just forget how bad their service is. I would avoid Alaska for the foreseeable future. I really don't know what direction this airline is heading, but I do know you can get better customer service on United (that's saying a lot).

### "They did a very good job"
Not Verified |  Seattle to Ketchikan. Easily printed our boarding passes at self-serve kiosk. When we arrived at the gate and inquired about early boarding (husband has a hurt knee, was using a cane), not only were we granted early boarding, but they also changed our seats to ones much closer to the front of the plane so husband didn't have to hobble so far. That was nice. Then we were seated on the plane, parked on the tarmac, for over 3 hours but they were great about it! The entire (Sea-Tac) airport was fogged in, no flights were allowed to take off or land. About 30 minutes after the initial delay, we were told by the Captain that we had the option to get off the plane while we were waiting for the fog to lift - but don't go too far, cause when it's our turn, we're taking off. The Captain updated us about every half hour as to our status, weather, etc. During each of the updates, we were reminded of the option to get off the plane if we wanted. Amazingly, not one person got off. I was pretty comfortable, and I think it was just the comfort of knowing I could get off the plane if I wanted to, kept me calm and comfortable. Then after maybe an hour, the stewardesses got on the P.A. and initiated a guessing game, with various snacks as prizes, until the prizes ran out. That was cool, an amusing distraction. Then, finally the fog lifted, and instead of being anywhere from number 25-40 in line for take-off, we were #4, as a result of nobody getting off the plane, we were ready to roll. A few ten minutes later, we were in the air. So, fast check-in, helpful gate assistance, pilot with options, and fun, creative stewardesses made a huge difference from what could have been a long, sitting on the tarmac for 3 hours, claustrophobic, trapped on a plane into a delay that was broken up with announcements, games, snacks, etc. and ended with a smooth flight, and a great landing - in fog at our destination! They did a very good job. Thank you.

### "no longer choosing to fly Alaska"
Not Verified |  Dallas to San Jose CA. Online it says the counter opened at 4am. All the other baggage check in areas were open at 4am, but not Alaska. Had to wait 40 min with 2 toddlers in tow. Sad to say, with this mishap, also with other charges on another flight that were inaccurate. I’m no longer choosing to fly with Alaska!

### "disgraceful to treat customers this way"
We boarded at N Gate 12A. One of the people I was sitting near found out that there would not be a boarding ramp that connected to the building for us to get on the plane. The agent at the desk told us that we had to walk down 2 flights of stairs, across the tarmac, and then up a winding ramp to get into the plane. Several of us agreed we couldn't do that, mainly the two flights of steps. I ordered a wheel chair to take me down the elevator to the lower level, across the tarmac, and up the ramp into the plane. Some of the rest of them just walked along with me and went down the elevator, too. N gate 12A had hardly any places for people to sit and wait, and people were sitting on the floor all around that gate. That plane was either a 737-800 or -900, and I think they should have been able to have it come in to a gate where there was a boarding ramp. The young man right ahead of me was in a wheel chair, also. He decided to walk up the ramp after we got out to the tarmac. He had feet that turned outwards, and he had a terrible time walking up that ramp into the plane, especially because it was a winding ramp. He was right ahead of me, and I watched him walking. What an experience. It looked like Gate N12A used to be N12, but the airlines had chopped it up into 3 pieces so they could have 12A, 12B, AND 12C. Hard to believe such a fancy airport has nowhere for people to sit while they wait 2 hours for a light. The old lady who was already sitting in a wheelchair was one of the few who had a seat. I think it's disgraceful to treat customers this way. I will have to think long and hard about flying Alaska Airlines again.

### "do not care about your belongings"
Honolulu to San Jose. I bought a new piece of luggage on my vacation and when I picked up my luggage the wheel was ripped off. Called to make a claim and they said sorry we don't cover wheels. Another lady got her luggage back and it was all  dented in. Do not fly Alaskan Airlines they do not care about your belongings.

### "never fails to disappoint!"
Salt Lake City to San Diego. Alaska never fails to disappoint! Only took the flight because it was free (used miles to buy). My wife is in a wheelchair, and the only thing Alaska cares about is trying to get an extra couple of $$ out of you. I have a Frequent Flyer number, so I get checked bags, yet they still want to charge. I offer for them to check my carry on, but they want to charge me until I get to the gate then they ask for people to volunteer to check their bags. (frustrating) I have learned not to use their Wheel chairs, because they leave you in the handicap seat at the gate and take the wheelchair. Which makes it hard to get your wife to the bathroom when you have a 2 hour wait. They won't upgrade people with medical conditions, first responders, teachers etc. to roomier seats even if they go empty. WHY??? All they care about is money not people. Other than that the flight itself was fine. I set a laugh how one row makes the difference between getting a hard stale cookie, and a bag of chocolate covered pretzels. Sorry I have medical bills to pay. If you have a medical condition I would recommend flying elsewhere

### "definitely above average"
Boston to Seattle. Overall an above average experience, but a bit to be desired on the competitive trans-continental route. The gate area used at Boston Logan for Alaska is quite lacking, with only one little area with especially overpriced food and old-looking carpeting. Onboard, legroom is beautiful, with plenty of room as one who is 5'10 or about 177 cm. Seat width on 737s is typically an issue, but I actually found it to be quite doable on this long haul. Now, what I alluded to regarding competition is JetBlue, who provides free WiFi and seatback entertainment, with plentiful snacks and drinks. For this route, JetBlue and Alaska were the exact same price, and I decided to try Alaska to try something new. Alaska skimped on the drinks, charges a whopping $45 for wifi (except iMessage, WhatsApp, and Facebook messenger, which can be used free of charge), and offers on-device entertainment through an app, or a tablet for $10. I purchased the fruit and cheese platter for $8.50, which was fine except for the slightly browned apples. I ended up being double charged and am still awaiting my callback regarding my dispute, after four days now. The plane was brand new, just two years old, and the gate staff and flight attendants were particularly kind and helpful. Another huge plus is an outlet and USB port which is on the seatback, actually, making very easy access, as opposed to between the seats near the floor. Alaska Airlines is definitely above average, but certainly there are better options, such as JetBlue, on the market.

### "The old bait and switch"
Seattle to Maui. I have flown Alaska for years. Was a former Gold member. Anyway, booked a Maui vacation 9 months in advance, had confirmed selected seats only to be informed we had been moved to the last row where the seats don't recline for a long flight. The old bait and switch. Not an Alaska Airline fan anymore.

### "never use Alaska Airlines again"
Not Verified |  Newark to Los Angeles. I will never use Alaska Airlines again due to the poor customer service I just received. I’m disputing a claim because I was charged erroneously for more than 1 bag for a flight I took in October where the agents at the desk took separate payments for myself and my friend who traveled together. There's allegedly no record of her paying for her own bag (i find that hard to believe) and they charged me twice. The customer service agent at Alaska Air didn’t want to help me unless I could produce a receipt, which my friend doesn’t have because this is now over a month later and she probably threw it out. So I’m being penalized for their oversight, and my bank is siding with the airline. This is the worst customer service on an airline I’ve ever had. Not to mention you get absolutely nothing when you fly anymore, the planes are getting smaller and flights keep increasing. All I’m asking is to be refunded for 1 bag - you’d think I was asking for a kidney donation. It makes no sense, if I was paying for her bag, why was I not charged on the way back? This has ruined my entire day for the way I was treated.

### "provided excellent service"
Denver to Vancouver. Just want to commend an employee who provided excellent service, the likes of which I haven’t seen for a while. There was a mom sitting in front of us with two children, one of whom wasn’t behaving well. He had some kind of device playing a game that was really annoying for the rest of us and the stewardes politely but firmly said he couldn’t remain with the sound on but she would get some headphones. The plane wasn’t completely full and once we had taken off, the stewardess gave a few passengers the option to switch into other seats to make this flight a little more comfortable. She did it in a well managed way. The stewardess then brought the child in front who was still having problems something to amuse him and a treat. He still wasn’t behaving well for his stressed mother so the stewardess took him for a walk around the plane to give the mom a bit of a break. She brought him back and continued with her work but then she returned again later, knowing the mother was still in a mini crisis. She took the time to sit with this mom and talk with her, understanding the difficulties she was having and giving her the comfort she needed. Both my husband and I were so impressed with her compassion and attentiveness and we are sure she made a huge difference to this mom. Top marks.

### "terrible flight experience"
Ft Lauderdale to Los Angeles. This was the most terrible flight experience ever because of one flight attendant. She was rude, unprofessional, unreasonable and ill-mannered. Her attitude doesn't belong to any job with customer service involved. It started with me not feeling well at the take off, so I had to first use my "little red bag" for that purpose & then two more bags of people traveling next to me. As soon as seat belts lights were off, I got up & proceeded to the bathroom to wash myself off. I kindly asked the male attendant, who was there, for extra bags, since I was feeling ashamed to ask people at front or rear rows for their bags. The attendant apologized to me but admitted they were completely out of bags! I went back and had to ask complete strangers in the back of my seat row to borrow their bags. I was then throwing up for another 30 minutes or so in fear that I will use all other bags and run completely out of it. My neighbor then brought me some napkins, so I was very grateful. I also used all water I had left in my bottle. I got up again & went to the bathroom. When I came out the attendant's cart with drinks was literally at my 19th row but they were still servicing people ahead of my row, so if they would move just one row back I would take my seat, but the flight attendant refused when I asked her to allow me to sit. I had to go back to the bathroom area to wait while I was so dehydrated that I could't even stand without leaning up against the wall. The FA passed by me few times taking more drinks (small wine bottles) with her. One time I stopped her asking for a cup of water. She said she can't stop the service because it wasn't her fault that I missed my time in my row. I pointed at the bottle of water standing near her working station, but she said its was her partner's bottle that he was using. It was obvious that the bottle was unopened and full. I explained her that I was feeling really sick, but she pretended not to hear me, and went back to serve others.

### "luggage totally damaged"
Los Angeles to New York. Terrible airlines. I received my luggage totally damaged. It took me months of fighting with airline and hours of calling to get my money back! They would never reply or call to solve the problem. The operators and managers have no respect to the costumers and dont want to take responsibilities! Will never use Alaska Airlines again!

### "incredibly rude and unacceptable"
Not Verified |  I have always enjoyed using Alaska Airlines. But, last night was different. I was on a short, late flight out of Portland into Redmond, OR. The plane was not full, in fact there were several empty rows. I had a long day of classes in Los Angeles, and flights home to Central Oregon. After the airline attendant had finished her duties of counting the passengers, and getting ready for the flight (the aircraft had not started moving yet-still sitting waiting) I kindly asked if I could move to the seat behind me. I really wanted a relaxing flight home. She said, "it is a short flight, just stay where you are". This was incredibly rude and unacceptable to me as a mileage member with Alaska. After I had nicely asked, there were others that moved without asking. I was respectful, and she was not. I would like somekind of explanation of why I was treated this way.

### "put me in the back of the plane"
Seattle to Austin. I booked a first class ticket as you can see. A completely different first class seat is broken but for some reason they took my seat away, put me in the back of the plane and gave this person my first class seat.

### "extremely unacceptable"
Seattle to Los Angeles. 4 days ago I called to purchase ticket, which could only be done via phone. During the process at some point the Alaska Airlines agent booked two other flights costing me over $2,600 using my credit card they also sent me their customers personal & flight information to me via email! The day the mistake happened (Tuesday) I was told my refund would be made within 3 days. I called Alaska Airlines today (day 4) and I'm getting the runaround with different numbers to call at a certain time. This is extremely unacceptable that I had to pay somebody else's flight, and even more not having my refund yet it is not $100 mistake it a greater than that.

### "great, friendly, caring"
Not Verified |  Portland to Las Vegas. I've flown quite a bit but this was the first flight ever for my grand daughter, who was turning 7 that day. She was fine until we boarded the plane and then it hit her and she was terrified. The flight staff immediately upon hearing it was her birthday offered to take her to meet the captain while people was still boarding, she went in but was too shy to allow a picture but he gave her her wings regardless. Then we sat in our seats, it was myself, my daughter in law and my grand daughter. By this time my grand daughter is full terrified mode, the flight attendant came up and was so kind and reassuring to her and made her feel at ease. Once we were up in the air, she brought her over a little snack pack and a soda and came over to check on quite frequently. Soon she decided flying wasn't too bad and actually liked it. She even wanted to take a picture with the FA but it was a full flight and she was very busy and we never got the chance. More than one crew member stopped to check on my grand daughter always making sure she was okay and wishing her a happy birthday. So my review of Alaska was they are great, friendly, caring and I for one will be a return flyer with them. Oh and Alaska now offers free movies and headsets! Way to go Alaska!

### "horrible in every way"
Newark to Seattle. I used to think United was the worst airline as far as customer service, efficiency and overall experience but after this trip, I now think Alaska is the worst. Our experience has been horrible in every way. Flight and boarding gate crew have been slow, rude and unhelpful. Our flight gate has changed both on our arrival flight and departure. Our departure flight was delayed but not for weather or even maintenance - just overall inefficiency. On our departure flight, they were out of several of the food and beverage options. I plan to cancel my mileage credit card and avoid this airline in future.

### "I do not recommend the airline"
San Francisco to New York. I paid as much money as anybody else, however my seat at the very back of the plane was not reclining on an overnight flight. The little comfort I could have had was not given to me. The stewardess told me there is nothing she can do. I do not recommend the airline.

### "a second class citizen"
Los Angeles to Ft Lauderdale. If you have never heard of the saying "second class citizen" then fly this airline. If you are not in First class then you are a second class citizen. I would have purchased a first class ticket but there were none available. This plane only had 12 first class seats. TV did not work for most of the 5.5 Hr flight. Have to pay for internet.

### "I was bumped to a 9pm flight"
Not Verified |  Medford to Seattle. I made a reservation few weeks ago to leave Medford at 9:30 am to get at 11 am into Seattle which is a decent time to get Seattle. Got an email 2 days prior departure telling me that I was bumped to a 9 pm flight arriving at 10:30 pm Time to get luggage it will be 11 pm and getting a UBer I am looking at midnight in Seattle. Tried to change flight for next day but only flight available are 5:20 am meaning I have to be at airport at 4:20 am. Decided to keep my flight at 9:00 pm which now is Delayed to at least 9:30 pm or more I am in limbo.

### "what real customer service looks like"
Portland to Los Angeles. I accidentally booked my flight for the day before I wanted to leave for my trip. I didn't realize until I got to the airport and went to check in. Luckily, an attendant at the counter was there to help! She calmly clicked away on her keyboard and within a few seconds, told me she had switched me to the flight for that day! This is what real customer service looks like!

### "dismal and unprofessional"
Truly dismal and unprofessional event. At gate 5.30am for advertised 5.55am boarding and 6.35am departure. Delayed, first by 15 minutes, then a further 15 minutes. Helpful gate agent took time to explain a/c had suffered bird strike on last leg of previous evening, but crew hadn't reported it. Morning crew had observed bird debris on walkaround, and needed a licenced engineer to inspect and sign off as airworthy. He was due before 7. He didn't show. Boarding changed to 7.30am. That came and went. No there was no Alaska engineer available so a 3rd party was coming. He arrived but wasn't licensed for the E175! Promises of 8am departure came and went. Several discussions were had with gate staff who promised the flight wouldn't be cancelled. At 8.20, after all my alternatives had departed, the flight was cancelled. Yes, the refund was set up instantly, but my careful prepared business meeting got burned, all down to a total lack of responsibility and process by the previous evening's crew. Anyone except Alaska next time, which is a shame. In all my years of travel, this is my first 1 rating, and that's for processing the refund.

### "Excellent first class"
Las Vegas to Los Angeles. Excellent first class seats on this A320. Only two rows of first class but the seats are wonderful for U.S. domestic First. The Alaska Airlines staff were wonderful and the overall experience could not have been topped. All of the seat functions worked and the plane is very comfortable.

### "pretty good experience"
Overall a pretty good experience. I was able to change seating with a simple phone call just after booking. The plane left on time. The flight crew seemed well trained. It seems to be a discount airline and they charge for check in bags and any food. But the price was good and I was not expecting a lot.

### "steward was very rude"
Not Verified |  Seattle to Reno. The flight itself was smooth. The steward was very rude. They wouldn't serve soda, even though the cart was full. They said the flight was too short to serve drinks, but served water, juice and you could buy alcohol. That makes zero sense that the flight was too short to serve drinks, (soda only), but they served drinks. That being said, my flight home, which was the same distance, served drinks including soda. Still scratching my head on that one. Anyhow, we were shortly going to start the descend into Seattle so I started to get up to use the bathroom and the FA very rudely told me to sit back down, I could not use the bathroom. It was another 10 minutes from the time he told me I couldn't use the bathroom until the fasten seat belt sign came on. Then he came by and got in my face and again, rudely told me to put my seat back up. I didn't even realize my seat was back because the person behind me kept pulling my seat and apparently it reclined it and I didn't notice it. He could have politely asked me. I was never rude to him although maybe I should have been. Even the people around me kept saying "what is this guys problem". I have never been on a flight with such horrible behavior from a steward. My flight home was great until I retrieved my luggage. My zippers were ripped off my bag and someone had gone through my bag. I thought if TSA searches your bag, they have to put a note in your bag that they have done so. I have had this happen before; there was no note that TSA searched my bag so if this is protocol, then Alaska should be keeping an eye on their employees. I feel very violated. It's probably a good thing I didn't have anything worth stealing in there.

### "very friendly and welcoming"
I had such a great experience with Alaska Airlines. We missed our flight by only 5 minutes and they were super accommodating and understanding and were able to get me on the next flight out to Seattle, WA from San Diego within the next two hours. They were very friendly and welcoming. Will definitely be booking with them again.

### "FAs available, friendly and attentive"
Vancouver to Fairbanks via Seattle. First Class. Alaskan First is better than other’s premium economy and European domestic business, very similar to Qantas domestic business. FAs available, friendly and attentive at all times. Contrary to impression given by their website and check-in staff, I was denied lounge access at YVR. Although the flight to Seattle is timetabled for an hour, because, so we were told, we were in the air for only half an hour there was no in-flight catering at all. Why should that mean no welcome drink? Ground congestion at YVR delayed us and we only just made the connection at Seattle. Ground congestion there was extreme, nearly an hour from push back to take-off. This meant that we did not get lunch until nearly 4 pm. Catering when it finally arrived was good, though. My bag did not make the connection and was eventually delivered to me at 11.30 pm at my Fairbanks hotel. As a result, I received an e-mail apology and offer of a discount on a future flight, more than you get from some carriers.

### "I am 5 hours delayed"
Los Angeles to Newark. This airline moved me to a way later flight for my connecting flight to Newark without my knowledge and despite my on time arrival to the gate. Now, I am 5 hours delayed. The transfer from LA terminals was not easy as well. Unacceptable decisions by the ticketing office. Unbelievable.

### "customer service is non-existent"
After vacationing in Alaska we used Alaska Airlines - needless to say we won't make that mistake again. We landed in Seattle and had about a 2 hour layover. We grabbed a bite to eat and headed for our gate only to find no one there. We asked if there had been a gate change and found out that yes it was changed. The agent was about as personable as a badger. We had to jump on the train and get to another concourse and fortunately made it there in time. The ticket agent at this gate, who had her hair piled on her head that looked like a birds nest was about as pleasant as the previous agent. We finally got onboard and sat there for the next two hours. The plane had sustained a bird strike which required a one hour maintenance review. The next hour was spent waiting for them to fuel the plane which was not taking fuel. After a two hour delay we finally took off. Upon our arrival in Dallas we went to collect our luggage. It used to be brown, clean and very nice. That is no longer the case. Least I mention that I am also missing a shoe which leads me to believe that baggage handlers went thru my luggage. Needless to say I was furious and was told that no one was available to take our claim at that hour of night. We incurred further expenses because we had to book a hotel as we had been up since 2 am, it was then 9 pm and we still had to make a 3 hour drive to get home. I also had to pay my dog sitter an additional day. I have filed a complaint within Alaska Airlines policy of making said complaint within a 24 hour window. Thus far all I have gotten back from them is an email acknowledging the complaint and that it will take them approximately 30 days to respond. Their customer service is non-existent! They don't care about their passengers or their belongings - they care about how many nickels and dimes they can squeeze out of you. They ruined our vacation!

### "One flight attendant was rude"
Not Verified |  Honolulu to San Diego August 23, 2018 I was flying out with my 7 month old and a 5 yr old daughters. I was hoping the flight attendants would be a more compassionate because at the airport the staff was able to give us comfortable seat. One flight attendant was rude unlike the older ones who were nice, it was understandable that they have policy but she could have tell it nicely like changing diapers like she could have said in a nicer tone that it’s only allowed In lavatory we understand that. Then my 5yrs old vomited and by that we were cleaning up the plastic bag they were collecting trash so we said we have a vomit but in a bag and she rudely said it should be thrown in the lavatory, the older attendant  was very nice accommodating our needs, she nicely said they couldn’t hold it but I can put it in the trash bag myself.

### "would recommend Alaska Airlines"
Los Angeles to Santa Rosa. I flew solo to go and visit family in Northern California. It was my first time flying Alaska Airlines since I had flown Virgin America Before then as my main airline. The plane had very comfortable seats and had a lot of legroom for the size of the plane. For food, you get the option between a cold drink, tea, or coffee, and a Biscoff Cookie. The flight had a very good view since we were so low in altitude. After flying on this flight I would recommend Alaska Airlines.

### "Terrible customer service"
Salt Lake City to San Francisco. Terrible customer service. Flight was delayed and they assured us we would have plenty of time to make it to our connecting flight. We did not. Only barely just made it running through the airport with my wife and 2 year old son. Plane almost left without us. Oh and we also checked our stroller at the gate and they didn't give it back to us - they want us to pick it up back in San Francisco.

### "the worst airline"
Not Verified |  Dallas to La Guardia. I have been flying with Virgin for a long time and loved every flight with them. Since they have merged with Alaska everything, including most of the flight attendants has gone downhill and fast. Even first class flights with them you have a 50% chance of having a rude flight attendant. I have had delays my last six flights, runs out of food, wont fill up a water bottle for you, changing the support dog policy and not notifying anyone, Customer service line is like speaking to a robot telling you the same sentence over and over again. I will be going out of my way to travel DFW airport so I don't have to deal with the delays and rude people who are think they are better than you. Get it together Alaska, you are officially the worst airline on a consecutive basis i have ever flown.

### "We are very disappointed"
Seattle to Portland. Terrible experience with our carry-on luggages. My husband and I were required to check our carry-ons because we were informed right before entering the plane, that the plane was too small for luggages. We never received luggage tags and were told to go ahead and board, that we could pick up our bags immediately after the flight. This flight was delayed 45 minutes, we arrived in Portland only about 10 minutes before our connecting flight to Detroit was leaving. When we attempted to pick up our carry-on bags from the people unloading on the tarmac, we were told to head to our connecting flight and that our luggages were also going to Detroit. We asked the gentleman unloading to allow us to take our luggages with us, since they were on the cart in front of us but not tagged, however he refused and told us he would be sending them to Detroit and was bringing them down in 4 minutes. Even though it was clear he had no way of knowing which luggages were ours and needed to go to DTW. At the gate before boarding the plane, we again explained the situation to one of the gentleman in charge of the boarding process and that our luggages had been taken from us, however, we never received any luggage tags. He asked us to describe the bags and assured us we would have them once we landed at DTW. Once we landed at DTW we headed to baggage claims, however, our bags never arrived. We proceeded to the Alaskan bag check-in counter, since the Alaska baggage service office was closed and there was no sign indicating when it would open. There was a gentleman who finally assisted us by having us write down our information. However, he said since we did not have official luggage tags no further inquiry could be made. When we insisted we receive some sort of confirmation or claim report to verify record of this incident he assured us his supervisor would meet us at the baggage claim service center to assist us further. We returned to ground level and waited in front of the door for over 20 minutes before returning upstairs to see if she would still be coming to meet us. We spoke with the same gentleman who helped us earlier he assured us she was on her way. After returning downstairs and waiting for another 15 minutes she came and took an official claim. The entire ordeal lasted for almost 2 hours. Due to the incident our transportation to home was delayed and my husband was unable to make it to work. When I arrived home I spent the majority of my day on hold with Alaska Air. I was on hold for over 2 hours, the operator said I would receive a call back in over 3 hours! When I finally received a call back I was placed on hold again for another 20 minutes, the person I spoke with said our luggages should be leaving Portland only that night and which would arrive at 4 am the next day. When I asked them to confirm they were out luggages, they could not. It was over 24 hours and we did not receive any updates on the status of our lost luggage from DTW service center. Furthermore, I repeatedly tried calling Alaska Air baggage service office with which we made a claim at (DTW) and was unable to speak with a representative, no one picked up. Over 8 calls and 4 emails later, our luggages were returned dirty and scratched the following afternoon, with no communication from Alaska Air luggage service center. This is the worst customer service I have ever received from an airline! We are very disappointed with how the entire situation was handled.

### "Old, dated and dirty planes"
Flew San Francisco to Boston. The worst! Avoid! Fourth business trip on Alaska Airlines this month so I have enough experience to write this review. Never on time always late. Old, dated and dirty planes. Broken equipment on plane. Disgusting bathrooms. Depressed, disinterested, and grumpy flight attendants. Limited food choices if not out of stock. Never again will I fly Alaska.

### "Alaska Airlines is a joke"
Anchorage to Chicago. Alaska Airlines is a joke. A 5 hour flight and all they give you is a pack of cookies, can't fill a water bottle with water and charge for everything under the sun? Don't book with Alaska Airlines, Delta is 100% better and you dont have to watch movies on your phone.

### "worst airline experience"
Newark to Los Angeles. It was worst airline experience. Crew were very arrogant and lack of manners. After landing of flight when i asked for water, they refused and said its over. They were not assisting us at all. Though I had a baby and they were not co-operating at all. Seats were very uncomfortable.

### "been a terrible experience"
The last 2 days have been a nightmare traveling with Alaska Airlines. First, my flight from seattle to Redmond/Bend on 8/7 was delayed 2hrs after the pilot came on the intercom just prior to turning on the runway to let us know that a fuel hatch light came on and forced us back to the terminal and eventually changed planes. Then my flight on 8/8 from Rendmond to Portland was delayed because the crew could not figure out how to distribute the weight on the aircraft. This caused a 30 min delay. Finally, my flight from Portland to Seattle also on 8/8 (writing as I still wait in another delay) has been delayed now 2 going on 3 hours. What happen to Alaska Airlines being #1 in on time performance. This has honestly been a terrible experience. Hope they could get things figured out, as Alaska use to be my top choice to fly.

### "just lost a frequent flier"
Phoenix to Spokane. You just lost a frequent flier. As we were boarding several people received text from Alaska stating the flight was delayed 45 minutes due to the Blue Angles flying in Seattle. Instead of stopping the loading process we continued to load for another 30 minutes and then sat on the Tarmac in Phoenix for 65 minutes. Completely unprofessional!

### "an absolute circus"
Seattle to San Diego. Worst flight ever. It was an absolute circus. First, the flight attendants were a half hour late. Then, after about 45 minutes of sitting on the runway, a man in an orange vest came on board holding a small plastic cover. He then asked us to stand up and help him find out where the missing part came from. Totally unprofessional. He never found the origin of the mysterious piece and then left the plane shortly after inconveniencing all of us. I might as well be flying spirit.

### "They can't get anything right"
I was set to Fri. 7/27 10:42 am from LAX to JFK. At 8:15 am at LAX, I tried to print my boarding pass, it said the flight was canceled. I went to the help desk and was told it was canceled due to "weather conditions. I was given the "next earliest flight to JFK" departing at 6:15 pm with a layover in Portland, departing again to JFK at 9:05 pm, arriving on Sat. 5:59 am. My friend who had an 11 am flight flying out of LAX with JetBlue on the same day to the same location took off. The flight from Portland to JFK got delayed 1 hr and we didn't depart until 10 pm. I wasted 24 hrs either at the airport or on the place thanks to Alaska Airlines! I was beyond exhausted. My return flight home on Sun. 7/29 did not depart on time either. The plane arrived late and had issues so we didn't depart until 40 min. after the scheduled departing time. I will never fly Alaska Airlines again. They can't get anything right!

### "No service, drinks or food"
Not Verified |  San Francisco to Austin. 3+ hour flight, no entertainment or even a magazine. No service, drinks or food, Staff never spoke to or acknowledge we were there. Ground Staff in SFO excellent.

### "express my gratitude"
St Louis to Portland. I just want to express my gratitude and thank Alaska Airlines for making a stressful experience so much better. I was original booked on another airline. Due to a huge delay I was rebooked on Alaska Airlines. I had never flown them before, BUT I will definitely consider them in the future. The ticketing agent was wonderful, she waived my bag fees since it was not my fault that I had to be rebooked. The flight staff was exceptional. Also, the seats were not crushed together and it felt like you had ample leg room.

### "friendly, and helping"
My 7 year old flew as an unaccompanied minor at 8:25 pm and I must have missed the fine print that the counter closed at 8:00 pm and I received a courtesy call from a very nice lady. When I told her I was 45 minutes away which put me st 8:45 pm she made a way to make sure I was able to meet her st the counter. Her positive, friendly, and helping attitude is so appreciated. When flying an unaccompanied minor Alaska Airlines is the way to go!

### "told me they’re sorry"
San Diego to Orlando. Still stuck on the runway in Tampa with no water and a plane full of screaming children! Alaska Airlines has doubled the flight time from 5 hours to 10 hours and we still haven’t taken off. All of the other weather delayed flights took off to Orlando hours ago but we didn’t have pilots. Not to mention we ran out of food on our first leg of the flight so I wasn’t even afforded the opportunity to purchase a meal! This is a nightmare. I’m starving, tired, thirsty, and nearly deaf from the screaming children. But don’t worry Alaska Airlines told me they’re sorry.

### "First (and last time) flying Alaskan"
Not Verified |  My flight was cancelled the morning of due to mechanical issues, so I missed a shift at work and couldn't find anyone to pick me up later in the day (hence why I choose my flight). Not too terrible. Got bumped to the next morning, only problem is that they sent me to Seattle first to catch a connecting flight to Sacramento. The gates were wrong, I missed my connecting flight and now I'm stuck in Seattle. First (and last time) flying Alaskan.

### "staff refuses to give the update"
Not Verified |  This trip is part of my roundtrip back to SFO from NY. While I understand there may be issues with airplanes from time to time, it’s sad to see the poor level of customer service coming from the Alaska attendants at our gates. The flight continues to be delayed with them not giving people an update. If you want to keep everyone happy, you should consider updating as much as possible over the PA. This is also known as communication. People shouldn’t have to tell each other what is happening because the staff refuses to give the update. I will admit they have announced it but it’s about every 1-2 hours.

### "will never fly them again"
Not Verified |  Los Angeles to Seattle. Our flight was scheduled in the morning. When we got to our gate they informed us the plane had to have maintenance done and that the flight would be delayed for one hour. After an hour, they delayed another hour. This continued for 8 hours in the airport (even getting to an annoying every 10 minutes or so boarding time change). Once we finally got on the flight, our tray tables were broken and the net that was supposed to hold our belongings was torn to shreds so we had to put all of our snacks in the overhead. My chair cushion was also broken so it would continually slide forward and make me incredibly uncomfortable. The plane was only half full because at this time many passengers had gone on other planes. They would not allow me to switch to a seat that was not torn up despite the vast vacancy on the plane. I will never fly them again, like one reviewer said they are worse than the cheap airlines.

### "worse than the cheap airlines"
San Francisco to Las Vegas. Going to Vegas to celebrate my daughter's birthday flight cancelled. I was on an hour's flight they rerouted us Seattle to Las Vegas 5 and 1/2 hours. No food no compensation major attitude saying that's the best we can do. We lost the money for the hotel which was expensive and we lost all of our activities that we had today we now will not get to Vegas until after 1am in the morning once again no food no drink. They said sorry that's the best we can do. Will never fly Alaska Airlines again they are worse than the cheap airlines.

### "staff were friendly and kind"
Seattle to Ketchikan. Amazing people working for this airline. My daughter flew by herself to Alaska and the staff were friendly and kind to her. I honestly felt safe leaving my daughter in their care. She said the flight was awesome. Thank you Alaska Airlines.

### "used to be a good airline"
c✅ Trip Verified |  Seattle to Santa Ana. This used to be a good airline. Their current policies are changing and causing agents to lie at the gate. I was so disappointed after I got BS thrown at me today so that they can ding me an extra $50. Definitely not a good customer experience.

### "decided to take a re-route"
Denver to Seattle. Horrible airline! It’s supposedly one of the better airlines, but it’s a huge myth. The flight was not only delayed for more than 2 hours, but suddenly it decided to take a re-route via Spokane for re-fuel. They should refund the $$ that I spent on my ticket. A travel of 2.5 hours from Denver to Seattle ended up being a 6 hour one.

### "canceled our flight home"
Portland to Honolulu. Never flying Alaskan Airlines again. I have a membership with them I will be canceling. They canceled our flight home and wanted us to say 2 more days in a terrible hotel, luckily we were able to get a flight with Hawaiian Airlines Home the next day. I called to see about compensation for the fact that we had to pay for our checked bag with Hawaiian and both of us had to call into work. Not to mention the fact that we were stuck at the airport for 3 hours tell we were helped. It’s crazy to me that they will not pay for there mistake we bought the protection plan and they told us they will still not be compensating us. I used there card all the time, hope it’s worth losing costumers over a few hundred dollars they cost us by canceling the flight.

### Alaska Airlines customer review
I paid more than $300 for first class ticket from Santa Ana to San Francisco and when I booked for my ticket no one informed me that i have to take shuttle from San Jose airport to go to SCO. I only found it out when I was checking in and they said i should arrive to shuttle at 2.30. Obviously I thought the shuttle bus will be ready when i arrive at the airport but it wasn't. The first two shuttles were taken by those who had connection flight at the SCO so i waited for more than an hour to get on the shuttle. When I called the customer service centre they said there will be no compensation for this flight because it wasn't their fault. More than half on this flight found out about the changes after they got on board. You charged me the full price for first class ticket when you already knew that I will only enjoy it for like 30 min on the plane. All my plans and schedules got delayed and screwed. Greedy and bad airline! My experience with this airline doesnt even worth 1/10.

### "never use Alaska Airlines again"
Kahului Maui to San Jose. When we flew to Hawaii, they said we went to the boarding gate too late, so they gave me and my 3 year old 2 separate seat in 2 different rows. I told him this is not acceptable and this is not good service. He replied, ‘I provided good service by assign you premium seats.’ I rolled my eyes and told him that I don’t care about premium seats, but the 3 years old cannot be seated alone. Luckily there are other passengers willing to switch seats with us. Now I am flying back. I try to check in online and select seats. I realized that they already assigned the seats for us. Again, my 3 years old is sitting by herself! You have the kid’s age when we purchase the ticket, you should know automatically they have to be with their parents. The whole Hawaii trip is awesome and I would never use Alaska Airlines again. Such a disappointment that Virgin America is now part of Alaska. They used to have good services. Even UA don’t split family seats. Alaska Airlines now is the worst on my list and will not go with this again.

### "never book Alaska again"
New York to Paris San Francisco. I didn’t think it gets worse than United, but fly out of JFK with Alaska and you may get your flight delayed over 2hrs and the folks at the gate don’t even bother to use the intercom. They just yell out the direction so no one can hear. Then they overbook the flight of course. Will never book Alaska again. Wish Virgin would have bought them, not the other way around, they used to be my favorite.

### "Keep it up Alaska"
Not Verified |  Seattle to San Diego. Alaska Airlines is the best. I don't think there is another domestic airline that gives first class passengers access to their lounge, downer is there is not a lounge at San Diego but that's not the airline's fault. Service on board is great with decent food and usually great wines. The lounge in Seattle is always very busy but it is always possible to find a seat and get a pre-flight beverage, food however is not that great in the lounge compared with the Amex Centurion lounge but they feed you well on the flight! Mileage Plan membership is also great - they give 175% mileage to First Class and the miles can be used on many great airlines internationally. Streaming video service has good movies. Keep it up Alaska.

### "impressed with their service"
Reno - Anchorage, Fairbanks - Reno. All flights were on time except a one hour delay that we were aware of and kept updated on, so no problem there. The planes made a few scheduled stops in Ketchikan, Sitka, Yakutat and Cordova so got to see a little bit more of Alaska then planned. The ground staff were pleasant and did not give us grief even with one of our bags being 10 lbs. over weight. Thought that was very nice and unexpected. The flight crew were pleasant on all flights with greetings upon boarding and goodbye's upon disembarking. Drinks and snacks provided on most all flights except some of the very short 25 minute flights. Only had to pay for baggage on one flight and all the others were free. On our flight home from Fairbanks there had been a booking error which was the fault of Alaska Airlines which we discovered before our scheduled departure luckily and when calling customer service they were extremely helpful, corrected the error and gave us a free upgrade on the flight. Very nice gesture indeed. It had been many a year since I last flew with Alaska Airlines and can honestly say I was impressed with their service on all levels. Planes were comfortable and clean and the staff seemed to enjoy their jobs. Not grumpy, rude or in any way negative about anything. Very nice experience.

### "forced to check carry on"
Not Verified |  Seattle to Las Vegas. I fly Alaska Airlines almost every domestic trip I take, however that has recently changed. I will no longer fly Alaska. On a recent flight, my wife and I were among the last passengers to board, and were forced to check our carry on luggage (1 small suit case), because we were told there was limited overhead space. We begrudgingly accept and board the plane to find about half the overhead space completely empty. I'm not exaggerating here either. There was room for another 30+ luggage bags. I immediately ask the nearest stewardess why we were being asked to check our bags with all the obvious available space, and she responds with: "We are concerned about overhead space filling up". I shoot her a confusing look and then look to the ample available overhead space, and she doesn't respond. This definitely sounds like a lame and nit-picky complaint, but we were meeting a friend at our destination who would be waiting on us to share a cab with, and the extra 20 minutes waiting for our checked luggage is a bit ridiculous. We packed light for the very reason of not having to check any luggage.

### "family holiday messed up"
Not Verified |  This is worst airline I have come across. Canceled our flight from San Francisco to Newark and gave us a few hours notice, I had to rush to the airport and rearrange a flight with United Airlines. We had flown from New Zealand. We had 3 of us in 3 seperates seats, family holiday messed up by Alaska Airlines.

### "flight delayed again and again"
Why there is not zero star? This airline should be zero. I came to Dallas from Maui. When I came to Dallas TX, the flight delayed 3 hours. Many passengers had to transfer at Seattle. The people had stood in line for 1.5 hours with big stress. My flight was delayed and cancel in yesterday. They booked today’s flight with first class. The flight delayed again and again in the morning. I should wait for 7 hours in the airport to take the flight with first class. I thought it can be delayed and cancel again and again. They suggested to change to American airline with economy to save time. I accepted this suggestion. Now I have to wait for 3 hours. I believe I made right decision. If I kept the Alaska airline with first class, I cannot expect when I can arrive at my final destination.

### "flight there was terrible"
Not Verified |  Detroit to Anchorage. Seating was a bit tight, flight attendants were very impersonal almost like robots trying to get through the drink and snack routines (other than that they didn't seem to want to be bothered)! They separated me and my wife, and didn't much care. We purchased the seating together so we could talk during our trip but that didn't happen! Alaska was awesome, the flight there was terrible. Will look for other means of transportation next time.

### "a very poor experience"
Not Verified |  Denver to San Francisco. I had a very poor experience last week with Alaska Airline. I booked a one way flight from Denver to SFO (FL 1867) scheduled to depart at 516 PM. On arrival to DIA, told new departure time was 6 PM. They had to wait for "paperwork". Finally boarded after an hour then sat in plane for over another hour because they said their tug had a dead battery. At this point they had to get another pilot or co-pilot as they had already worked more then permitted hours. Finally we were underway over 2 hours late and we were told gate agents would meet us with information on connecting flights. We landed then had to wait to taxi to a gate and officially arrived 2 hrs and 31 minutes late. There was no gate agent there on arrival and I missed my connecting flight to Palm Springs. I had to look for a departing Alaska flight to find an agent. I had checked online and there was a United flight leaving at 1030 PM that I could have made had there been an agent to meet us. I could have been given a hotel voucher but decided to take a 6 AM flight to LAX so i ended up at airport all night. Then Alaska told me they would Uber me to Palm Springs at their expense as there were no flights to PSP that day. My Uber driver didn't find me so I had to wait in line again for 40 minutes and Alaska did send me to Palm springs by Super Shuttle. I was no offered any compensation but a $12 food voucher at the time. Very frustrated with Alaska Airlines!

### "Everything was great"
Not Verified |  Tucson to Seattle. Everything was great. Boarding a little chaotic, but Alaska Airlines agents were trying to explain the new carry on bag policy coming up. Flight attendants friendly and just set a pleasant mood. We left early but because of air traffic delays at Sea Tac, we were a little late. Some people want to complain, but the airlines have no control about these delays. Some people just want to complain about everything, but on Alaska Airlines website, everything is pretty much spelled out. Some People just don't want to take the time to read it, and when they are told no you can't do that or carryon it on, they want to blame it on everyone but themselves.

### "Horrible customer service"
Kansas City to San Diego. Alaska offered Gate Check for bags since the flight was so full. I took my bag up, they called for boarding, the agent said he would get my bag. Got to destination, no bag. The baggage agent for Alaska in San Diego blamed me for losing my bag. Also treatdd me as though i was lyong abt havibg a bag at all. She was very rude, not helpful at all. She put in a claim for me. I tried to call the office for days, no one  answered or the line would just hang up. I went in to the baggage claim office 2x before flying back to MCI. No bag, "not their fault", but no one would actually look for it! Kansas City talked to the Gate agent, the bag was put on the plane to San Diego. 2 days after getting home got a call from Seattle Corporate, bag had been sent there because over 5 days since claim filed. They had my bag, from San Diego, said I would get it the next day. The end of the next day came, no bag. I called them, flight into MCI wasn't even in yet, but I would "definitely get it the next day", told me to call MCI to verify where to send. I called, they said since not within 70 miles of airport would have to send FedEx but I would get "PRIORITY" & receive the next day. She called me back with tracking #. Later that evening I checked and I wouldn't get bag for 3 more days! All I got was a $100 discount code. I wait 2 weeks for my bag, still don't have it & get $100. Horrible customer service, lies, lazy.

### "I suppose I expected a little more"
I write this review as I sit aboard Alaska flight 141. I have flown Alaska many times, and I made the mistake of not flying first class this time around because this is such a short flight. I am remembering now why we normally do pay the extra money. After being hit by people and their bags walking by, I’m then poked by the flight attendant who informs me that my bags “just won’t work” in the overhead bin after someone moved it. That’s fine, luckily there was plenty of room in every other bin so I moved it myself. I suppose Alaska is nice when you pay 3x as much as everyone else, but I suppose I expected a little more.

### "Alaska Airlines is dead to me"
Denver to San Francisco. I decided to try them out because I've heard they were good. Never again. Several minutes before the boarding time, there was no plane at the gate. The gate agents were nonchalantly chatting and poking around on their terminals. No announcements or explanations. Passengers wondering aloud what is going on. When the boarding time "came and went "with still no plane at the gate, only then did their app update with what I would soon discover was a random new boarding time. After another update, the plane arrived and we all boarded a roasting plane. The captain said there was no APU available at that gate to boost the AC. We were an hour late by now. Nothing was ever mentioned about the lateness so I assume it's normal for them to be late. Then, the plane had a mechanical issue at startup. They apparently have no pull at Denver International, because it took 20 mins for anyone to even arrive at the plane to examine the problem. The prognosis was not good, so they let everyone deplane again. They asked people to "stay in the area" although for much of the time there was no Alaska Airlines staff at the gate counter - just a bunch of passengers wondering what was going on. After another 30 mins the flight was canceled. My impression was that this airline, at least in Denver, is amateurish. They offered compensation by a computer-generated "heartfelt" email, but it was just a credit toward a future flight. It's like "sorry about the bad service, here is a coupon for some more bad service. Alaska Airlines is dead to me. Never again.

### "Shout-out to Alaska Airlines"
Omaha to San Diego. Shout-out to Alaska Airlines. Allowed me and Kam to board first (due to my being a military person ), upgraded our seats for free; and even received a round of applause. Moments like this really makes the early mornings, late nights/deployments and time away from family really worth it.

### "had the best time"
My husband and I flew home from Orlando to Seattle on Monday night on Alaska flight 19 from MCO to SEA and had the best time! The flight crew were very accommodating and joked around with us each time they came by our row, messing with us about our drink orders. My husband and I are pretty fun people so we really enjoyed the playfulness on such a long flight. This was our first time flying in the premium section and the extra 4 inches of leg room really makes a difference! Plus, you get a free checked bag as well as complimentary drinks the whole flight. I always fly Alaska when I fly and have yet to have a bad experience and will continue to fly Alaska any time I can.

### "have a lot to improve on."
Las Vegas to New York JFK. I’m currently writing this review while I’m on flight. This company have a lot to improve on. First and foremost they should have stated that for passenger that siting on row 8 and 9 (behind and front of emergency exit) that their seats can’t recline! It’s a  5 hours flight. You expect me to sit straight for the whole time? I booked this flight on October of 2017, which is 6 months in advance and they didn’t bother to state the seat won’t recline? The passenger in front of me recline their seat all the way so it was even more difficult to move or to eat. The meal tray can’t even put all the way down, so I asked the flight attendant to help me ask the passenger in the front to move the seat up a little so I can eat. The flight attendant say she can’t do it because it’s the passenger right to recline all the way or changed seat but all seats are taken - so what about my rights? My rights were taken away from me. Although she later ask the passenger to move a little so I can put the tray down but I already felt disrespected. This is considered my rant and it is my first and last time I’m taking this airline.

### "Alaska has a long way to go "
❌ Not Verified |  Having been a dyed in the wool Virgin fan, I was eager to see how Alaska measured up. They didn't. I flew back from Philly on a Sunday evening (7:45 scheduled departure). The flight didn't take off until 10 p.m. I wasn't notified via text until 6:30 that it was delayed (same thing happened on the flight from SFO to Philly). Had I been notified a bit earlier, I could have stayed and had dinner with my son before going to the airport. How is it passengers aren't notified sooner than an hour before the flight that there are system wide delays due to air traffic control issues in Philly that had been an issue for hours on both flights? Worse yet, I flew First Class and was looking forward to seeing how it matched up with Virgin. Sadly, no comparison at least no in this flight. While the flight attendant was good, they seemed totally unprepared for passengers. He had to go to the back to get mixers each time. Dinner was a mess. I got the vegetarian entree I didn't order, followed 25 minutes later by part of my original order which was stone cold. Perhaps it was because they transition isn't yet complete, but regardless, Alaska has a long way to go before earning my family's loyalty.

### "never fly with Alaska again"
Fort Lauderdale to San Francisco. I have never flown with Alaska Airlines before. I had heard good things and was looking forward to my direct flight home from a week long vacation. Unfortunately however, I had a terrible experience. Before we took off, the flight was delayed several times. The lack of information from Alaska staff was the worst I have experienced. During the initial two and a half hour delay the only announcement that had been made said "The flight will be delayed by 80 minutes due to weather, which is good news compared to what I was hearing. Alaska staff seemed surprised when people came up to the desk with frustration. After boarding three hours late and being requested to buckle seat belts, we were told we'd be off the ground asap, max 30 minutes. The flight took off 80 minutes later with absolutely no further announcement. Once up in the air, my seat did not go back. My screen brightness buttons did not work. My headphone jack did not work. There was no USB charger. And the wifi did not connect for the entire six hour flight. If all this wasn't bad enough, Alaska flight staff then decided to offer double shot free alcohol to a clearly unstable gentleman sitting in the seat closest to the exit row door. This decision put the safety of all passengers on board at risk. After 3-4 large drinks, the gentleman proceeded to shout loudly on at least 10 separate occasions, and continued to act erratically. After another gentleman on the exit row requested to be moved, he was left alone in the exit row to potentially open the emergency door in his inebriated state, or perform action in an emergency situation! My wife was seated directly in front of this now drunk, unstable man and genuinely feared for her safety. Finally the Pilot was summoned to threaten an emergency landing and FBI action. Quite frankly, my wife and I and several other passengers we talked to were just relieved to land safely. Needless to say we will never fly with Alaska again.

### "tried to do the best they could"
Flight San Francisco to Vancouver was delayed by 2 hours 45 minutes, causing me to miss a connecting flight- the last of the day. This was not Alaska's fault, as the delay was ordered by SFO air traffic control. Alaska offered me another flight the next day from SFO, which I declined and, after a 2nd call, a flight from SEA the same day with a different airline, which I accepted. But after boarding the plane a mechanical issue arose, which took another 3.5 hours to resolve and again I missed connecting flight. Throughout Alaska did their best to keep us informed, they apologized profusely and they offered us food vouchers and complimentary food and drink of their own, including alcohol. It seemed they tried to do the best they could under the circumstances.

### "will not give me a credit"
Boston to Seattle. If I cancel an upcoming trip with Alaska Airlines they will not give me a credit, instead they ask for 125$ extra cancellation fee and fare difference that will be more expensive if you book a new tickets with all these penalties. In jetblue they give atl east minimum amount credit after their cancellation fees so I decided not to book a ticket from Alaska Airlines.

### "now that flight is delayed"
New York JFK to Los Angeles. My flight was cancelled, so I had to take one the next day - now that flight is delayed multiple hours and the gate seats haven't even been built yet. No complimentary lounge or anything. They just expect us to sit in an unbuilt terminal for hours relaxing. Last time I ever attempt to fly with this airline. Too bad Virgin and them merged.

### "worst airline I've flown"
LAX to San Francisco. After dealing with parking and the shuttle chaos of the LAX, my family arrived as they called for boarding to the counter. We were refused our paid in full passes, and told we couldn't board the flight. We could see the gate from the counter, and there wasn't a line for TSA. Any other airline I've flown on would accommodate for a small time crunch, but they flat out refused and proceeded to charge us $2004 for new tickets. The gate was still open for some time after double ticketing 3 adults and two 6 yo children. Again, we had plenty of time to casually proceed if we were allowed to. This is the worst airline I've flown, and they will rob you any chance they get.

### "never flying Alaska airlines again"
My bag didn’t come with me on my flight from Fort Lauderdale to San Francisco for some reason and now I have to wait days before I can get my bag back. I don’t know how the airline found this acceptable and I didn’t once have anybody apologize to me and the 20 other people who also had their bags left behind. I’m never flying Alaska airlines again, it’s not worth the trouble.

### "a much better experience"
Alaska Airlines has a morning flight from Pullman to Seattle leaving at 5am, allowing passengers to catch early flights departing SeaTac. I flew this route on a busy Monday morning, to make a connection to Atlanta. Security at Pullman Moscow Airport was extremely fast and allowed TSA PreCheck, so getting to the 5am flight went as well as it possibly could. My only complaint was that, in the front row of the Q400 prop plane, the seat was extremely cold from the boarding stairs (it was well below freezing) and never really heated up during the 1-hour flight. The connecting flight to ATL was a much better experience and more typical of Alaska Airlines.

### "didn't live up to expectations"
Portland to Los Angeles. I fly Alaska regularly and consider them a top-notch airline. However, this flight didn't really live up to my expectations. The flight was surprisingly empty for a major route, with the plane only about half full. However, there was a crew member that was late to the gate, so we left about 20 minutes behind schedule. The in-flight staff were also not particularly pleasant, although the flying experience was the same quality as ever. Overall, this flight showed some chinks in Alaska's armor.

### "very friendly and helpful staff"
I was travelling from Las Vegas to SFO by Alaska Airlines and I was late, the check in for the flight had just closed. I had not checked in and I also had a bag to check in, and at this point the check in time had just passed. The representative at the check in desk was extremely helpful and he said that it might be very hard but it could be possible to make the flight. He checked us in and also took our baggage, and said that the bag may or may not make it in the flight. He asked us to run, and we somehow made our way through security and with just 15 mins to departure, we ran towards the gate and the representative at the check in desk had informed everyone and people were waiting for us and we were able to board the flight and our luggage was also in the flight. I'd like to thank Alaska Airlines for their exceptional service and very friendly and helpful staff.

### "seats are plenty wide"
Austin-San Diego-Austin, First Class on Alaska Airlines / Skywest E-175. Easy check-in with 3 bags to check. Enjoyed the Admirals Club at AUS, which still has a great staff, even though food offering are lagging Delta's or United's Clubs. Quick boarding as this jet only holds about 70 passengers. For a regional jet, seats are plenty wide and comfortable with average at best legroom. Power port at every seat is nice. Pre departure beverage and an on time departure. Right after take off, First class was treated to Virgin America's signature smoothies, which I enjoy and I thought this level of service, along with a printed menu indicated a fine meal was forth coming. I'm a fan and love airline food and never complain, however the meal, if you can call it that was the most appalling breakfast I have ever seen, on a plane or the ground. Half dollar size, dry and cold scrambled eggs and a salmon cake of similar size. Thats it. Beverages served in plastic cups. No mugs for coffee either. Just abysmal. The return flight, easy check-in despite the poor condition old San Diego's terminal 1. No lounges, poor food options, as we thought of eating before getting on the flight, due to the service on the way to San Diego. Fast boarding, no pre departure beverage this time, no problem, once airborne, printed menus again, followed by warm nuts in a ramekin, then a large, nicely presented dinner of chicken with wine sauce. Rice and whole grains were on the side. Bread warm bread with butter and a small dessert of apple crumb cake. Over all very satisfy and tasty. Alaska's crew are very warm and engaging and seem happy to be there for your safety and to serve. Overall a good trip, mired by terrible food offered on the First flight to San Diego

### "a robot could do better"
Seattle to Los Cabos via Los Angeles. Review of Alaska Mileage Member Customer Care. For the record, after calling their Customer Care and being escalated to their management, I was refunded my choice of 2500 miles over $25 but not until I was berated about their policy and that they charge all young kids regardless of their age, but especially a 3 year old with a bag fee? I wasn't there, but my wife checked in and paid even though she was entitled to a free check on? The $25 was charged to my 3 year old daughter. 23 kg worth of luggage - instead of my wife who was on my ticket purchased (buy 1 get 1 for the tax and fees) I was running back from parking after curbside drop off. I identified as a mileage member, ticket bought on promotion charged by the book, instead of the human interaction. Was educated and then refunded. I think a robot could do better.

### "Overall very disappointed"
Flew on flight AS 782 at 6:25 am out of Portland, OR to Orlando, FL. On the aircraft premium economy offered no additional benefits. Alaska advertises passenger comfort but really a five and a half hour flight with no meal included in the fare is absurd. The added cost to purchase a sandwich or a cheese plate is insulting for the price you have to pay. Free on board movies were not free (as advertised) as you had to buy their WiFi service or pay $10.00 to view on their tablet. On decent into Orlando tremendous eye and inner ear pressure as the aircraft attempted to adjust the cabin pressure, sign of a cabin pressure unit needing service or replacement. Overall very disappointed with this airline. They can do better.

### "really dissatisfied"
Seattle to Salt Lake City. Terrible employees who don't follow what they say. They don't treat everyone equally and that's the biggest problem. Several people with properly sized carry on got them taken and placed in baggage check while others brought on bags way over the carry on size or even more carry on bags than they allow. They call you up according to where you are seated but no one listens and just clusters up. The planes are dirty and feel really old and uncomfortable. Most airlines seem to be a lot more upgraded. Really dissatisfied with the flight and how I say other passengers treated. I will not be using this airline again and would recommend you to choose another airline unless you are getting a great discount with your flight. Also seats feel like sitting on a bench.

### "This airline sucks"
I fly Alaska Airlines all the time since I live in Southeast Alaska and they're the only airline out of Juneau. Far more of my flights with them have left late than have left on time. This is a recurring problem at every airport: O'Hare, Juneau, SeaTac. I have missed connecting flights and ferries due to long delays. My most recent trip to Alaska involved sitting in the plane for 2 hours at the gate in SeaTac because they didn't have a pilot! They boarded us knowing the pilot was probably somewhere over the Dakotas at the time and just left us sitting there. For 2 hours. With no airflow. We were offered about 4 oz of water exactly once in that 2 hours. While Alaska does have great customer service, to me that just doesn't make up for being treated like a farm animal once on the plane. Make sure you've booked a 3+ hour layover or you most likely won't make your connector. And they will lie to you the entire time you're waiting, "just another 20 minutes and we'll be pushing off! I do not appreciate being treated like a 3-year-old.Have some respect for your customers and tell us the truth! This airline sucks.

### "positive flight experience"
New York JFK to Fairbanks via Seattle. Early morning flight from JFK terminal 7 departed on time. The terminal itself is undergoing renovation and had very limited dining and shopping options. The plane was full. Boarding was a bit chaotic largely because of limited space in front of the gate. During the flight, several runs of beverages were made. Varieties of food were on sale. The cheese platter I had was excellent. The cabin was bright and clean and leg space was sufficient. iPads were available to rent to watch a movie. There was ample overhead space to stow your luggage. The lavatories remained reasonably clean on this 6+ hours journey. Flight attendants were extremely friendly and efficient. The inflight experience on the flight from Seattle to Fairbanks was similarly positive though the plane had fewer seats than the one originally scheduled for that flight. Consequently, quite a few passengers had to be rebooked on later flights. The gate agents were extremely courteous yet firm. Luckily, my seat had been preserved on the connecting flight. The flight was on schedule. Alaska airlines provided a refreshingly positive flight experience. It was largely the result of a friendly attitude of the crew. An excellent option over the Big 3 domestic carriers.

### "not impressed with my experience"
Seattle to Minneapolis. I have always flown with Delta because their customer service is outstanding andhad great experiences. However, I was unable to book a flight through them so I chose Alaska Airlines being that I had heard good things. I flew with my 7 month old baby and had my car seat and stroller with. I booked her as a lap infant and was told I could check in my car seat and stroller right before getting on the plane. The woman who assisted me, being that it was my first time traveling with a baby, gave me a large plastic bag and zip ties and said whoever was at the plane helping load, would place my car seat and stroller in the bag that way they would be protected and not dirtied or ruined. When I got off the plane at my destination, the zip ties and plastic bag were in the bottom of my stroller and my stuff had not been covered. Now both my car seat and stroller have dings, dents and scrapes. I am very upset with the fact of this. As I had purchased a brand new combo after being in a car accident with my baby. I was not impressed with my Alaska Airlines flying experience.

### "The worst flight"
San Francisco to Los Angeles. The worst flight I have been on. First the flight was delayed 1 hour. Then we were forced to sit on the plane for an hour and 15 minutes before taking off. Mind you, the flight from San Francisco to Los Angeles is 55 minutes to be exact. All because of weather - even though it stopped raining 45 minutes before we actually took off. (Virgin America / Alaska Airlines).

### "avoid it at all costs"
Originally scheduled to fly from Dallas Love Field Airport directly to LaGuardia. There was inclement weather forecasted for NY later that day, so I paid a $25 change fee to fly out on a different flight that departed 2 hours earlier around 10:30 am. However, the storm hit NY earlier and my new flight was delayed over 4 hours and eventually canceled after sitting on the tarmac for an hour. Once we were notified of the cancellation, I called Alaska Airline’s customer service to rebook my flight. There were no direct flights available and there were no flights available to get me home that day. I was offered two options on different airlines: either fly to Seattle that night and take a red-eye to JFK or fly to Los Angeles and take a red-eye to JFK. Neither option would get me to LaGuardia, which was where my car was parked or get me home in time for an important event I had scheduled for Thursday morning. Because of this, the customer service representative offered me a $75 travel credit, reimbursement for the flight change fee that I paid for my canceled flight, and reimbursement for my travel from JFK to my car at LaGuardia. Once I returned home, I called Alaska Airline’s customer service to work out the reimbursements; however, I was told the airline does not provide reimbursements for flights canceled due to weather. While I understand that the airline is not responsible for delays due to weather, it is completely unacceptable for the airline to not fulfill what I was originally promised. Especially after sitting in an airport for over 10 hours, making me pay for a change fee for a flight that was canceled, arriving in a different airport, and booking an inconvenient layover on the opposite side of the country. I certainly will never fly on this airline again, and I would recommend anyone avoid it at all costs.

### "deserve at least communication"
Oakland to Seattle. Flight was schedule to leave at 12:50 but here we are at 4:00 pm still waiting with little or no information. Really Alaska? Very disappointed and there are 100 of your customers really frustrated. And your customer service - not so much! Shame on you. We, deserve at least communication.

### "never fly Alaska airlines again"
St. Louis to Seattle. Absolutely dreadful experience. Arrived at airport 40 minutes prior to take off, make it to the check in counter to check in our bags granted we had already checked in online - lady at check in desk was already telling us she needed to rebook us. 40 minutes prior to the plane taking off with an empty TSA check in line. The worse part was even after essentially begging the front desk lady to let us on for 10 minutes, she announces over the intercom for final boarding. Those 10 minutes could have easily been utilized for us to board the plane. We will definitely never fly Alaska airlines again.

### "Excellent in all ways"
Mexico City to San Diego. Excellent in all ways. Aircraft was clean, well appointed and very comfortable. We departed punctually and arrived into San Diego early. The on board entertainment was excellent as was service by enthusiastic and passionate staff. The food was nice but not over the top. Seats were comfortable with more than adequate space to move about.

### "making customers happy"
. Kellie at the check in and baggage area was extremely helpful to us. We had acquired a lot of souvenirs and our bags were overweight. She helped us redistribute weight and gave us one complimentary bag check for free. It was super stressful and embarrassing but she was so kind and gracious to us. Made us feel a lot better. Thank you Alaska for employing kind people who enjoy making customers happy.

### "pleasantly surprised at the experience"
I flew Alaska for the first time today. Seattle to Philadelphia. I was pleasantly surprised at the experience. I had flown American on this route earlier. This was far better than the product offered by American or United. On time performance. Friendly staff. Newer plane. They hand out tablets for entertainment. WiFi available onboard with a good selection of movies/shows to watch through the Gogo entertainment app. Seats were comfortable with good legroom. They served refreshments (beverages) twice with a choice to buy meals onboard. The cabin crew walked around the cabin very frequently handing out water and were very interactive, attentive and friendly. Will definitely be traveling with Alaska again in the future.

### "I was too late for my flight"
Portland to Spokane. If you don't check in 45 min before flight, your screwed. I went to the kiosk to sign in and it said I was too late for my flight in 40 mins. It took 15 min to wait in line and speak to a trainee, for her to tell me the same thing the kiosk did and to immediately sign me up for the next flight.

### "service drastically worsened"
New Orleans to Yakima via Seattle. Since Alaska has consumed Horizon Air the service has drastically worsened. Fewer flights, longer layovers Last night I was unable to ticket all the way through to Yakima b/o a short layover between the only direct flight from New Orleans to Yakima (not enough time for baggage transfer, I had no checked baggage) made it in plenty of time to catch a ride on plane with open seats. I was told I would have to pay a penalty greater than the cost of flight. In the days of Horizon the switch would have been granted without question, very disappointing! Today the flight to Yakima is leaving from N12c. There is no close seating, a temp stairway down to tarmac, a walk out the tarmac and a stairway up to plane. Low budget.

### "items stolen from checked baggage"
Cabo San Lucas to Los Angeles.After 30 years of international travel, this is the first time we have had items stolen from our checked baggage somewhere during this trip. Yes, in hindsight, I should have had it in carry on, but it was my property and not for baggage handlers to have free access to steal. I have photos of it before we left Cabo San Lucas and a very messy suitcase upon arrival in LA.

### "Excellent flight attendants and service"
Flew Phoenix to San Francisco with Alaska Airlines. Excellent flight attendants and service. From ticket check-in on they were paticularly kind to another passenger traveling with a baby, and seemed very helpful overall. I have traveled with small children many times and the flight attendants being understanding and kind makes all the difference!

### "poor customer service"
This flight was completely canceled due to "high winds. I have lived in ABQ for 29 years and in all my traveling experiences this has never happened. When I called customer service they said oh no problem we are putting you on the next flight to Seattle then to Portland which made me think okay I still have a shot. Nope it was canceled already but their system wasn't updated and by the time I called again all the flights were booked and they were unwilling to put me on another airline even though the Alaska Airlines staff at the airport had at first been doing that for other passengers. This trip had been planned for months and I ended up having to cancel everything because of "high wind" when other planes were landing just fine and a poor customer service who booked me on another canceled flight. Highly disappointing.

### "staff continues to shine"
Los Angeles to Orange County via San Jose. Short business trip up to San Jose for a meeting at the airport, then returning to orange County. Flight to SJC on an E175 was delayed an hour reducing my scheduled 2 hour meeting time at The Club in San Jose airport. The folks at the Alaska lounge put me on a later flight departing San Jose back to Orange county, saving my meeting. Flights were pretty empty on both flights, only about 25 people on each. Boarding was quick, early boarding for premium Economy. E175 seats are very wide anyway, combined with the extra legroom, very comfortable for a short 50 minute flight. Flight attendants served drinks quickly, Had a nice Pinot and a complimentary snack box. Later flight from SJC to SNA boarded and left on time. Same service, more wine and the snack box. Flew into LAX early in the day on AA, premium economy. Yes more legroom, early boarding,but nothing else. Alaska, Virgin and Delta really go the extra mile in premium economy. Nice job Alaska, your staff continues to shine.

### "crew were excellent"
Flew round trip from Dallas Ft/Worth to Seattle and amazed by the services and seat. The crew were excellent and were making funny jokes and announcements. They were friendly and were making sure that everyone was ok. The seat was better than an international or domestic flight in my years of travel. I would have wanted a personal IFE but there was free movies and WiFi available on your personal devices. The ground service at both DFW and SEA were amazing and when they scanned your boarding pass they would say thank you for flying Alaska Airlines!

### "recommend Alaska Airlines"
San Diego to Sacramento. Professional Flight Crew who were friendly and approachable with excellent service. Great Breakfast and Wonderful Coffee. Aircraft is comfortable, clean, spacious and and in good condition. I would highly recommend Alaska Airlines.

### "Stranded in Boise yet again"
Due to fly Boise to Seattle. Stranded in Boise by Alaskan Airlines yet again! Once again I sit in Boise, promised that my plane will be repaired for the 3rd time in 4 flights out of this city. If Alaska can’t get reliable aircraft on this run, they ought to give up the route to an outfit that can.

### "mileage credit a complete farce"
Seattle to Kahului. First of all, the mileage credit are a complete farce. Normal tickets were about $759 per person, round trip. As soon as I clicked “get discount using miles” the prices were close $1200 per ticket. These accumulated miles are basically worthless. At 1 mile per dollar spent, or even 2 miles per dollars, you need 50,000 miles to go from Seattle to Portland. That means I’d have to spend $50,000 dollars to het a ticket worth $120!

### "everything was above my expectations"
This is the first time that I have flown with Alaska Airlines, and my expectations were really low, but I have to admit that everything was above my expectations. Flew from San Francisco to Mexico City. The aircraft was in very good shape, the staff were very attentive and friendly and food and beverages were pretty good. I would be happy to fly them again.

### "staff was very rude and unhelpful"
San Diego to Mexico City. My today’s flight to San Diego was cancelled because of technical problems of the aircraft. The staff was very rude and unhelpful. They just offered us 18 dollars lunch vouchers and we could fly the next day. They did not take any responsibility just wanted to get rid of the passengers as soon as possible without helping them. The lady that should be helping did not want to make even one phone call for us. It is unacceptable. Will never use this airlines again. Very bad experience

### "there will be a two hour wait"
Due to fly Orlando to Portland. There are three groups of travelers waiting for the Alaska ticket desk to open so we can check our bags. Have been told there will be a two hour wait before we can even speak to a ticket agent. Furious! You want us here early - so we can hurry up and wait for you. We’re all hauling our bags around, unable to go through to the gate area, do you can save $$ on staffing. One agent to accommodate your customers would be sufficient. But no. It is not okay to treat loyal customers in this fashion. It’s how you lose them! !

### "bumped me off the flight"
I booked the plane tickets from San Francisco to Cabo San Lucas 6 months before my travel date. 2 days before boarding, when I looked at my tickets online, did I finally realize that Alaska had over booked and bumped me off the flight. Instead, they added a stop to Seattle for me. Adding not only 4 hours to the total travel time, but I had to arrive at the airport 3 AM. I called and complained. Not only did I receive no explanation or apologies, they offer absolutely no compensation. I then raised my concern on their facebook, but my comments were marked as spam by Alaska. I heard they had good seats and good service, but none of that matters if they do not fly you on the flight you booked.

### "we are back at the gate waiting"
Flew Alaska Airlines from San Diego to Boston. Absolutely terrible. Today we were taxiing to the runway and the pilot came on the intercom to tell us the second engine won’t start! So now we are back at the gate waiting for them to fix the plane. How are you so negligent that you don’t know an engine won’t start until after you’re headed to take off? This is ridiculous. Now we have hours of delays to fix something that should have been addressed before we even boarded the flight. The previous time I flew Alaska, this thanksgiving, we stopped in Minnesota to change pilots on our way to Boston. We had to land, change crews, and take off again! 2 hours late! How do you do that to people. Do not fly this airline, unless you wish to be late.

### "Talk about humiliating"
I've heard such great things about the customer service, but my experience has just not lined up with what I've heard. On my first Alaska Airlines flight 6 days ago, my boyfriend and I were separated without ever being consulted or notified. They changed our seats and pretended that we booked them that way, even though one of us purchased both seats right next to each other. Now today, on my return flight, my boyfriend and I booked using "companion fare. He's been an Alaska cardholder forever, and he purchased his ticket full price while giving me the discounted companion rate. He had a medical emergency that prevented him from getting on the plane, and I was literally told to leave the plane 5 minutes before take-off since my boyfriend was no longer flying with me. We paid for his ticket, never asked for or expected a refund since it was a last minute emergency, and I paid my companion fare price in full. I'm not unreasonable - I understand that the "rule" states we must be flying together. But that "rule" was never made clear to us in the booking process, and we couldn't have seen this emergency coming. My real issue is with the way I was treated - the flight attendants loudly told me to "exit the plane immediately," forcing me to inconvenience everyone in my row so that I could get my bags down and haul them through the isle once more. I got all the way to the door (walking past 24 rows of people) when they informed me that the boarding door had closed, and they'd "be forced to allow me to fly - but never again in the future would this be allowed. Talk about humiliating. I slept the entire flight in fear of interacting with the flight attendants who clearly did not want me on board.

### "nasty, sluggish, and useless"
Seattle to Victoria. Well let me just add another review for this despicable company on top of the many. Me and several others experienced a “weather” problem on our flight and did not land so we flew back to our origin. The company was therefore allegedly not responsible for reimbursement of anything. Our flight left at about 1130pm scheduled to arrive at around midnight. Strangely, there were many other planes that landed and yet our was unable. We were then told to just go to customer service where probably 100 passengers lined up to wait while they offered a 9pm flight the following day and no other reimbursement. That would mean 2 hotel nights of accommodation to pay for if we took that pathetic offer. The customer service department was nasty, sluggish, and useless. This is a trash company, stay away!

### "We are not flying this airline again"
Flight from Hawaii to Seattle OK, good sevice from crew. Connecting flight from Seattle to Victoria, a short 30 min. flight, total disaster. Flight cancelled due to "weather" (so airline assumed no liability and provided no assistance, even for overnight stay in Seattle), when the weather at both the origin airport (SEA) and the destination airport (YYJ) was clear (ceiling at Seattle at least 7,000 feet, visibility at YYJ posted online at that time of day as > 12 miles with one passenger hearing a report from his family at destination that they could see stars in the sky, winds low (< 10mph), no precipitation. Of all of the bogus claims I have ever been subjected to, this one has got to be one of the worst. A Delta flight flew the same route just 20 minutes earlier without delay. The cancellation was announced almost an hour before departure - without even waiting to see whether, in fact, weather remained (or ever was!) an issue. No other cancellations observed on the screens at SEA that night and no other cancellations shown online at YYJ. Apparently, there had been fog at YYJ the two previous nights, so my only guess here is "pre-emptive cancellation" (a cancellation because someone thought there *might* be fog again but didn't bother to either check or wait to verify). The next day, there was a wait list for the first flight out. My wife and I had gotten the last 2 tickets on that flight. After Alaska offered $0 for the overnight delay and their phone number for discounted hotel rooms ["at passenger's full expense but we'll at least help you get a discount"] turned out to be worthless (phone number had automated, "sorry, no rooms available" message), they NOW offered $400 each for people willing to give up their seats and fly 2-3 hours later. Normally, I'd say "sure" if this was a non-work day (I tend to jump at anything above $150/hour) But my wife's wisdom on this question was worth listening too: "$400 in cash? sure. $400 in airline coupons good on Alaska? Worthless! We are not flying this airline again! Alaska had the one and only flight connection that allowed us to get home from Hawaii without enduring an overnight flight. Turns out we would have been better off (and paid much less for tickets) putting up with the overnight flight.

### "need to step up their game"
Portland to Sacramento. By far the worst airline I have ever been on. Every time I fly Alaska they ruin something in some way. If you have different carry on requirements for different planes you should list that online. Doesn’t seem fair to bring a piece of luggage that is to spec according to your online regulations then force someone to check in their bag when they get here. Also, every flight I have been on has been delayed. They need to step up their game and get a better schedule because they are seriously the worst. Do not recommend this airline at ALL. Southwest is the way to go. I would give 0/10 if it would let me.

### "disappointed in the quality of service"
Worst flight experience I have ever had, really disappointed in the quality of service. First plane was delayed an hour and a half as we sat in the aircraft before takeoff. Due to this, I missed the connection to my next flight, and they rescheduled me for another flight 10 hours later. I asked Alaska service desk about my checked bag and they told me that it would be on my next flight. I expressed concern it would be lost, but they reassured me it would not. I left on the next flight and arrived at my destination without my checked luggage. The Alaska service desk at my final destination said it should be on the next flight. Two flights have arrived since them and every time I call they all can’t trace my luggage. I had all my Christmas presents in that bag. I am still waiting to hear back for the 3rd time, but there is little hope the next flight will have it. Really frustrated and disappointed in Alaska airlines.

### "not recommend for families"
Kahului to Seattle. This airline will separate your family! Three flights in a row they separated kids from us. Plus customer service is terrible and will not help you. They will not give you the seats you reserved and paid=d for. I would not recommend this airline for families.

### "would not check us in"
Pullman to Seattle. Absolutely the worst customer service I've had with an airline. I highly recommend not flying out of the Pullman Airport in Washington. The customer service left the check in desk and would not check me in, making me miss my flight. I arrived at the airport over 40 minutes early and others got there even earlier than that. All employees left the counter and would not check us in and made over 6 of us miss the flight. I'm never been treated worse by an airline in my entire life.

### "Worst service I have had flying"
Flew Alaska Airlines from Atlanta to Spokane. Worst service I have had flying. We were supposed to take off at 7am and it is now 10.37am and we "don’t have a reason" as to why we are still in Atlanta. They don’t know what to tell us or even say to us. Beyond annoyed that they can’t figure this out. Highly recommend flying with another airline.

### "I paid $110 for nothing!"
Los Angeles to San Jose. The customer service at the airport was horrid. I bought a round trip ticket to SJ from LA ($110) for a wedding ahead of time. Then 32 hours later, I found out that the date was changed to the day before. I called the customer service representative to see if I can change my flight to the day before and they said the change would cost me 125 dollars! Which makes no sense, I voiced that I was going to miss the flight to the representative and find another way there and just take the flight back to LA. Now I’m here at Alaskan Airlines to take my flight to LA, but apparently I can’t fly back since I didn’t attend my first flight! So basically, I paid $110 for nothing!

### "Alaska did what they could"
Vancouver to Seattle. Outbound from YVR to SEA was a good flight, until touchdown at Sea-tac. The flight departed and arrived on time, except it gated late. Reason being was another aircraft was getting deiced at our gate. The flight gated late by about 20 minutes - airport's problem. Otherwise, pretty solid flight; good attitude from cabin crew; cabin lights shut off in the duration of the flight so people could sleep; no food or drinks served due to the shortness of in-air time; clean interior. Inbound from SEA to YVR in the same afternoon was cancelled due to snow. (This is an Alaska flight operated by Horizon Air.) Went to the counter and was told to go to customer service - which had about a 2 hour line. They cancelled a lot of flights. Wanting to come home I booked a one-way with AC. After my return to YVR, I received a text from AS that I got rebooked on an 11pm flight to YVR, which I no longer need. I called Alaska, lined up and got a call back after an hour. I asked and received a refund for the return flight to my credit card, pain-free. Thank you Alaska. Overall a rather worrisome experience, but I think the weather was to blame. Alaska did what they could to serve the customer, which is much appreciated.

### "it was absolutely shocking"
Portland to Honolulu in first class on 17 October and it was absolutely shocking. Do not call this first class because it is the worst class that seats are cramped and the plane noisy, the inflight entertainment is so bad just save your money and go with another carrier. When I complained online to their customer feedback that is also rigged and it won't allow you to give them a bad rating that is why I came here so you will all know what they are like. I am so disappointed about that flight.

### "no one was empathetic or even cared"
Orange County to San Francisco. My first and last time flying Alaska Airlines. Our flight was supposed to leave at 8:47am, then delayed twice because of San Francisco grounding international flights (yet we were domestic trip, but Alaska Airlines parks in the international terminals at SFO). When delayed for a 3rd time, the attendant at the booth stated the next flight will not leave until 2:50pm. We confirmed with attendant to make sure there will be no chance for an earlier flight and he stated "No, there will be no earlier flight then 2:50pm and to check on Alaska Airline app or website for updates. It was 10:45am, so we decided to leave airport to grab lunch and come back for 2:50pm flight (we were not the only passengers that left airport). While at lunch my boyfriend checked website and app (which did not work) on his phone, so I checked my phone and it stated 11:30am flight boarding. We decided to call 800# customer service to get clarification. Customer Service Rep stated they show 11:30am flight, we explained our situation and all they said was "You should have not left the airport". I called the airport directly to confirm and make sure Alaska Airlines knew what they were talking about, at this point we have lost all faith on anything Alaska Airlines were telling us. The airport called to the gate for us and confirmed they are boarding and will taking off at 12pm. We called back to Alaska Airlines and explained again our situation to another customer service rep. Alaska Airlines rep scheduled us to be on the next flight to SFO at 4:30pm. We asked if they could do anything for us (move us up 1st class, comp drink tickets, etc). No, as delay was not Alaska Airlines fault it was SFO, yet they did not even listen that it was their attendant who gave us false time. We arrive back at the airport by 3:30pm and plane was delayed 2 more times to 5:50pm because crew was stuck in SFO and flying down. We get into SFO by 8pm (an hour flight that took almost 11 hours of our time)! Not one Alaska Airlines employee was empathetic or even cared.

### "Any other airline is better"
Portland to Edmonton via Seattle. My flight to Seattle from Portland was delayed over an hour. No explanation or compensation was offered. No drinks or snacks were offered on this flight. Upon late arrival in Seattle my flight to Edmonton was delayed as well. Again no explanation offered. For my entire round trip on Alaska airlines my flights were either cancelled outright or delayed. Not one flight was on time. Very poorly run company. I would not recommend Alaska airlines to anyone. Any other airline is better.

### "customer service was terrible"
Seattle to Los Angeles. I had a flight that was originally scheduled to depart at 740pm. I had a 1 hour and 21 minute layover and was supposed depart on Virgin America from LA to Boston. The flight out of Seattle was delayed until 8.45pm. I got out of the plane at 1124pm and missed the 1126 flight to Boston. The crew on the flight said there would be a representative available for those connecting with Virgin. There was no representative around for questions. Virgin America told me I would need to find an Alaska representative. I looked all over the terminal and finally found 2 at Gate 69A. They initially tried to help, but since it was almost 12 by then they were eager to leave for the night. They told me to go to Customer Service next door and someone would help me. I waited 10 minutes and no one showed up and the other workers left for the night. I had to resort to calling customer service. They informed me that I was rebooked for a 7.50am flight with Virgin America the next morning. I was never made aware of that or given options. They also would not give me a hotel claiming it was due to air traffic control and they were not responsible. So I got stuck at the airport for the night. The customer service was terrible. Honestly, I fly a lot. I had really liked flying with Alaska previously and was going to fly more with them. I even got their credit card. I had even talked with my friends about how I preferred Alaska, but after this experience I have changed my mind. I have some flights with some partner airlines coming up, but I no longer have a preference to fly with Alaska. I also will be changing credit cards in the near future. I no longer need to accumulate points with an airline I am not pleased with.

### "with poor customer service"
Edmonton to Portland via Seattle. My flight at 6am was cancelled and rescheduled to 1 pm. Then my 1 pm flight was cancelled as well and I was placed on a flight the next day that had an additional stop and got me to Portland more than 24 hours later than when I originally booked. The response from Alaska Airlines was not adequate enough in my opinion. I spent 45 min on the phone with them fixing this issue. I would not recommend flying Alaska Airlines to anyone. Many previous flights have been cancelled for me as well. Overall a poorly run company with poor customer service.

### "the outstanding assistance"
Redmond to Denver. I wanted to acknowledge the outstanding assistance I received from a booking agent of the Alaska Air Seattle, WA. office in making last minute reservations for two separate trips I was planning to take. The agent patiently walked me through the process to book a flight from Redmond, OR to Denver, CO. on October 3rd, 2017. She also assisted me in booking a flight for my wife and I round trip from Portland, OR to Fort Myers, FL departing on April 24th, 2018 and returning May 19th, 2018. She was friendly and polite throughout our entire contact and serves as a great representative to Alaska Airlines which is why I continue to choose Alaska AL whenever available.

### "unhappy with the service"
Flew Seattle to Sacramento. First they bumped us from premium when they downgraded our plane, then they moved my large child onto my lap and I was forced to buy a new ticket at last minute prices (4x what I originally paid). Then they boarded and we sat on the runway forever before they returned to the gate to let someone on. How important did that person think they were. If they were sick or something I'd be happy to accommodate them but they seemed decidedly not in special circumstances, then we sat again for 20 minutes. By the time we took off we were supposed to have landed. My poor daughter was worked by the stress of the situation and I ran out of snacks and tricks. Seriously unhappy with the service.

### "the worst customer service"
New York to Lihue via Seattle. I booked a trip to Hawaii on Alaska almost 1 year before the flight date. This week, Alaska decided to change all of their flights, turning what would have been an 11 hour trip to New york into a 20+ hour trip with an overnight layover. I am flying with a 9 year old. When I called two days ago the agent had offered to fix my trip by routing us from Ogg->LAX->JFK. I called back today (2 days later) to take them up on that offer, and the agent said she would be unable to do that, and that I'd have to buy a whole new ticket. This is ridiculous on multiple levels. First, I paid $3000 for the voucher I used, which was donated by an Alaska executive at a Parkinson's charity auction. I am happy to track down and document all the details of that. Second, It is the airline schedule change that is causing this issue. Third, Alaska Airlines offered me this remedy two days ago, which was not ideal, and are now retracting that offer. Frankly, I'm speechless. This is the worst customer service experience I've had in a long time. Probably ever. And this is just the return flight. For the outgoing flight, they've change the schedule so that my connection now departs before I arrive. There is another flight from JFK (rather than Newark) that would solve this issue, but they are unwilling to make that change, due to some technicality in their system -- even though these airports are 20miles apart. See the picture below. It's a total joke.

### "go rebook with customer service"
Tried Alaska Airlines once, never again. Flying from Phoenix to Edmonton with a connection in Seattle. Phoenix to Seattle left on time, but was 25 minutes late. We got to our gate in Seattle 10 minutes before our flight was supposed to leave to have them say sorry, go rebook with customer service. It was their mistake and they still wouldn't let us on the plane that was at the gate. Will never fly or recommend this airline.

### "I had a wonderful trip"
Portland to Santa Barbara. I had a wonderful trip. Got in early and just perfect. On my way home had a rather interesting trip. First our plane was late. Arrived at PDX alniatcan hour late. Then had maintenance issues, somleft Oregon line an hour late. Everything seemed fine, but then just as we were going to be landing in Santa Barbara, tee were diverted to Fresno for sone issue with a stabilizer and needed a longer runway. I was a bit freaked, but we landed safely in Fresno. All were taken off the plane, and were in Fresno for about an hour. Were given food vouchers and snacks. Thankfully it turned out it was not a stabilizer, but the computer and plane were not synched correctly and was easily fixed. We were in Santa Barbara after this in a half hour. I think the flight crew were wonderful as was the pilot and co pilot. Our safety was number 1, and to me that means a great deal. Would fly Alaska again and feel secure with them.

### "lack of credible information"
Flight from Seattle to Bozeman was delayed by 2 hours and after a long trip the last thing you need is a long delay. The FA's did a good job considering that everybody was annoyed at the delay. The problem was lack of credible information on the ground. The delay kept being extended and extended. I think Alaska Airlines could have done a better job keeping us informed.

### "boarding passes issues"
Returning home to Phoenix from Alaska to Phoenix via Seattle. Had boarding passes issues in Anchorage. I had 15 minutes to get to my gate before boarding started which was unbelievably far away. Arrived at Gate C and sent me to gate N for which you have an underground shuttle. Once I arrived at my ticketed gate I found they move to back to gate C on the other side of the airport. Had to run like a fool and barely made it at the cost of running around people. All the "smiles" from flight crew don't over ride the lack of communication and help by gate personnel when simply said "your gate was moved - better hurry only 10 minutes till doors close". Note to gate desk personnel - when you see a boarding pass was issued then changed with the gate you are in charge of, maybe you can be a little more helpful. And note to exit staff, maybe update passengers of connecting gate changes as they leave the plane. Seems like the 1st rule in transportation. Help your customers find their destination when you make a change or issue a incorrect boarding pass. Maybe even offer to call the correct gate people to tell them you are on your way.

### "booked me on an oversold flight"
Seattle to Ontario. Flight was canceled and then they booked me on an oversold flight. It is extremely frustrating when you get the the ticket counter and the attendant tells you that the flight is overbooked! Who's fault is that? They make it sound like it is our fault.

### "our bags did not make it on the plane"
We flew from Saint Louis to Anchorage with Alaska Airlines. One of our bags did not make it on the plane in Seattle. When we arrived to Anchorage, we realized it did not arrive. The luggage service told us they did not put the suitcase on in Seattle because the "plane was too heavy". They offered a $25 discount on future travel! They could not tell us when our luggage would arrive, despite at least 10 flights a day from Seattle to Anchorage. Furthermore, they could not tell us when we would receive a bag. Finally, they could not tell us what kind of allowance we could have to purchase gear needed for fishing which was in our bag. To make matters worse, the airline never communicated with us via phone to provide updates. The following morning, almost 24 hours later, the bag had not arrived. We were then informed initially that it would be on a train, then on a bus to Seward, 2.5 hours from Anchorage. The bag was then delivered to a random Bed and Breakfast in Seward. After multiple phone calls and hours spent, the bag was located and delivered to our lodge approximately 30 hours after arrival. Customer service could only offer $300 off future travel, even though we told them we wanted something else.

### "most disappointing flight"
Seattle to Honolulu. This was the most disappointing flight of my life. I had paid for Premium Seats at $60US extra. Then 3 days before our flight they email us, not call, to tell me that they are changing the aircraft and there are no premium seats. Well what happened to my $120? Oh it will takes up to 14 days to get that back sir. So not only did we loose our great seats in our this money till it's returned on there accord. During the flight we asked to by chips 3-4 times, every time they said ' Oh we are just checking for those". Finally we land and still no chips during a 6 hour flight. Also, no Wifi connectivity through out the entire flight! Way to go Alaska airlines. I know I will never fly with them again.

### "comfortable seats with power outlets"
The gross difference in cost for a first class ticket from Portland to Kansas City was around $314. $554 for first class, $240 for economy. Savings of $50 for 2 checked bags, around $10 (I think) for the hot meal, $7 each per drink, snack. Net difference is around $247, or $124 each 3 hr 30 min leg. FC ticket allows use of AL lounge at PDX (none at MCI), which was OK. FC cabin has 12 comfortable seats with power outlets and dedicated flight attendant. Free Gogoinflight service is barely satisfactory. Service, food and drinks were all good on both legs. Excellent FC check in service at both ends. Boarding / exiting first with ample overhead bins is nice. Question is: Would I fly FC again to this destination? Frankly, it's a toss up.

### "on time performance continues to decrease"
Another late flight out of SFO, which was 100 percent Alaska's fault. I've been MVP Gold 75k for 6-7 years in a row and their service and on time performance continues to decrease. This trip we fully boarded on time and at departure time the pilot announced that the plane wasn't fueled yet and was waiting on a fuel truck. 40 minutes later one showed up. This plane was sitting at the gate 30 minutes before boarding even started so there was no excuse. Ever since Alaska merged with Virgin, and moved to the Virgin gates, performance has plummeted. I plan to spend more and more on Delta. You no longer earn my business Alaska.

### "this trip was not a good one"
Redmond to Reno via Portland. I've had a lot of good experiences with AlaskaAir, but this trip was not a good one. Two hours before the flight, I get an e-mail saying "Sorry, your flight has been canceled. However, the e-mail, ios app, and online all showed the same exact itinerary. It wasn't until I arrived at Portland did everything update to show that my PDX-RNO flight was completely canceled. I was auto-booked for a flight the next day. Not only is that terrible, but the lady at the counter was able to fit me into the last seat on a flight that afternoon, which means the auto-booking system isn't helpful. I had to sit in Portland twiddling my thumbs for 8 hours, and it was awful. Here's the redeeming qualities of Alaska Airlines, the rep gave me some vouchers for food and snacks, and discount codes for my next booking. Not a worthy trade to me, but at least they were apologetic and tried to remedy the situation as best they could. Like I said, this was my only bad experience with Alaska so I won't swear them off for that. Except for the flight attendant that skipped over me for a drink. That was annoying.

### "It was a terrible experience"
My husband and I have flown Alaska several times to LA before and have never had a problem with them. However, this time I was traveling back to Washington alone with my 2 year old. We called earlier and asked if someone would be able to help me carry his 40 lb car seat to the gate. They said if we arrived 2 hours earlier we could request a gate pass. So on the day of the departure we arrived early and found out that they wouldn't give us one. No explanation. So I had to carry the car seat, my luggage, and have my 2 year old running behind me to make it through the tsa screening and walk all around to find our gate. It was a terrible experience and I don't understand why they said one thing on the phone and then no in person. The actual ride wasn't bad but I don't think we will use Alaska Airlines again.

### "very helpful, great service"
Alaska Airlines flight from Redmond to Portland, and was then headed to Oslo, Norway after that. I only checked my luggage to Portland and thought I had to get it and check it again. A very nice lady checked the possibilities to check my luggage all the way, and I did not even ask for it. I did not have my flight numbers ready but she just fixed it all for me and was so very helpful. Great service.

### "a top notch experience"
Detroit to Seattle. Phenomenal service, excellent food. This is my first time flying Alaska, and I chose them because they're partners with Virgin, it was my best flight in a quite a while. This plane was older and the interior was showing wear, so I was a little concerned about what to expect - worry not, you're in for a top notch experience with Alaska Airlines. Service was super friendly and attentive, meals were designed by Seattle chef Tom Douglas (I skipped the entree & dessert, so I can't comment on that) but the salad was very nice, dinner smelled wonderful (pesto), dessert was gorgeous, and the beverages never stopped flowing. I've read reviews that Alaska's first class chairs are uncomfortable due to pitch, I didn't find this to be the case - I found them very comfy, but this was only a 4-5 hour flight. The only slight negative was I had planned to work in-flight and the barely there internet connection made that impossible - they use GoGo and it runs $24 for an in flight pass. I'm not sure if the wifi problems were a GoGo issue, a hardware issue, or due to some other factor. I didn't mind though, it was nice to take a break and enjoy some on board entertainment. Even better - the cost for this first class nonstop flight was only around $100 more than the next best option - an economy carrier with seating headaches, no meal service, and connections amounting to twice the travel time! Alaska Airlines - my new favorite carrier!.

### "cabin crew were all very nice"
My first experience with Alaska Airlines flying from Portland to San Francisco. Not happy with ground staff who charged me 75 dollars for a slightly overweight check-in luggage. I was travelling with a First class ticket and with my baby. On board, cabin crew were all very nice. The purser provided us with an outstanding service. It was highly appreciated specially as I was travelling with a very young baby.

### "outstanding Alaskan Airlines team"
Bozeman to Anchorage via Portland / Seattle. I'm blown away at how far this company has gone to help me get home. My booking agent took me on a wild ride with a 6 hour layover in Portland and a 11 hour layover in Seattle. When checking my bag the agent said no this won't do we can't do this to you and told me to speak with my gate agent for help. As busy as my gate agent was she worked with 3 others to get my flight from Seattle to Anchorage bumped up shortening my layover. They told me to get on standby in Portland asap to avoid this 6 hour layover. On Memorial Day I got the last seat. I'm heading to Seattle 5 hours early and might get home to my dogs tonight if standby works in Seattle. I want to thank the outstanding Alaskan Airlines team for helping me get home the quickest most affordable way possible. Customer for life.

### "how service is meant to be"
A direct return flight to Seattle from Boston. Both ways were on time, which is generally regarded as mission impossible in the Boston Logan airport - no idea how they manage to pull it. The return flight landed half an hour early which was very much appreciated, considering that it was almost midnight. Alaska guarantees that the bags are delivered to the carousel 20 minutes from the moment the disembarkation starts, both times it was faster than that. Drinks were served 3 times during the 5 and half hour flight. The selection of meals for purchase was generally so so, but no demerit points for that since it's expected of all airlines. They did give a free cookie. Ample space between seats. The wifi was sluggish at times, but the entertainment package was fine. The crew were efficient and polite. But it's the service that made me write the review making sure the airline gets a deserved praise. After the outbound flight, our bag was nowhere to be found. We filed a report while a very patient and nice customer service lady told us what may be happening. She also said that the bag may arrive while we are filing the report as it may have been misdirected elsewhere in the airport. This is exactly what happened. Her apologetic and helpful attitude was already compensating for the inconvenience. However, we were given $50 discount off the next flight. On the flight back, something started dripping on me from above. It turned out some kind of saline solution from another passenger's bag (makes me happy that they prohibit carrying acids and dangerous chemicals!). The crew rushed with napkins, cleaned everything up, made sure the dripping stopped within minutes, and we got all the alcohol and the food for free. This is how the airline service is meant to be. Well done, Alaska!

### "very friendly and accommodating"
We flew from Detroit to Seattle to Oakland and then finally to Maui, all flights were Alaska Airlines and I was very impressed. I am one of those people that are afraid of flying but never once did I feel unsafe. The flight attendants were very friendly and accommodating. The only complaint I would have is probably the same for all airlines, it is just so cramped and when flying 5 hours becomes very uncomfortable. I will definitely recommend Alaska Air to anyone looking for a great airline.

### "Another great experience"
❎ Unverified |  Anchorage to Portland. Another great experience on the best airline in the Pacific NW if not the USA. The flight down to Portland was just great, a redeye. I sat with two other Veterans so we were able to spend some time comparing our service activities, places, people and things. The flight was as good as could be hoped for - clean plane, wonderful crew and on time to boot! The flight to Chicago was perfect in all respects. I was moved to First and sat next to a young lady who works for Alaska. We spoke about a number of subjects and I inquired about her time with the airline. She said she is very pleased to be with them in the reservations department. I told her I am a Gold member and really enjoy the flights I have had these past seven years. I spoke with two of the flight attendants and thanked them for their obvious hard work and great attitudes. Again, the flight was smooth, great service and fine food. I could not have asked for more!

### "doesn't recognize my itinerary"
San Francisco to Matzitlan via Los Angeles. Alaska and Virgin America are merged except for computers. I can't even post a review on alaskalistens because the form doesn't recognize my itinerary. I booked thru Alaska Airlines and they put me on Virgin America for the SFO to LAX leg. When I got to SFO they couldn't book my luggage to Mexico. The counter agent observed or booking was stupid. We told him Alaska booked it this way. First leg ended in LAX, point to point. So our luggage could book thru. After three levels of supervisor and 45 minutes the ticket agent figured a way to get the luggage to Mexico but advised us to check in Mexico to avoid the issue returning. No agent in Mexico would take responsibility for the issue. As a consequence when we got to LAX on the return we had to shelp our bags from terminal 6 (Alaska) to terminal (3) Virgin to recheck them in. Took so long we missed our flight to San Francisco. We are long time Alaska users with a credit card and a mileage plan. Very disappointed. If they try to put you on Virgin for one leg be forewarned that they haven't worked out all the kinks is the merger. And I couldn't even make this statement to Alaska direct because the company doesn't acknowledge an SFO to Matzitlan itinerary using Virgin for one leg.

### "Really nice employees"
Albuquerque to Portland via Seattle. Surprisingly awesome. Really nice employees on and off the plane, timely, great landing, option to check carry on bags for free when the flight was full, preassigned seats, relaxed boarding, free texting and entertainment via gogoinflight, and good cookies.

### "customer service agent very rude"
Alaska Airlines is the worst that I have flown on. Not only did they give up my seat from Seattle to Anchorage, the gate employee and the customer service agent was very rude. They didn't offer anything to fix the problem and rebooked me for a flight 6 hours later than my original, middle seat, after I have been flying for about 18 hours.

### "one of the worst experiences"
Los Angeles to San Francisco. I've made a point to fly Alaska Airlines most of my flight for its previous customer service reputation. I booked a flight first class using mileage in April 2017 and realized how terrible this airline has become. They cancelled my flight two days prior to departure and I received no notification or rebooking. I spoke with customer service the day prior after trying to check in and the agent was rude, short, and told me no I can't find anything to rebook you on. I asked her to check other airlines as this was their mistake and she said no. It was one of the worst experiences in 30 years of flying. Sad because Alaska Airlines used to be my airline.

### "Alaska Airlines is a standout"
Seattle to Victoria. In these days of poor airline customer service, Alaska Airlines is a standout! Our 11:20pm flight from Seattle to Victoria had to be cancelled due to maintenance issues. As soon as they informed passengers about the cancellation, they already had a plan in place - everyone was a accommodated in hotels & vouchers given for food. No waiting around, no fuss! Thank you Alaska Airlines!

### "a great airline overall"
Los Cabos to San Francisco. Alaska Airlines is a great airline overall. Their service and staff, flight attendants are very nice and helpful. Entertainment can be good depending on which aircraft you go on. If you are on a flight longer than 3.5 hours, then you can rent their entertainment tablet for around $8 or $10. This includes free movies and games. If your flight is under that, then bring your own device and download the Gogo app before departing. You will be able to watch free movies if your airline has wifi. It's great that they have power outlets. Wifi is expensive at $16. You don't have to purchase wifi in order to watch entertainment on your device. The seats are a little smaller than some airlines and not the most comfortable. But they do recline pretty far back. It will be interesting to see what happens when Virgin America merges with Alaska Airlines.

### "great crew, clean plane, wonderful service"
❎ Unverified |  My wife and I recently flew to Kona, HI from Anchorage, AK. Prior to boarding we took in the Alaska Boardroom and enjoyed our time there. We flew in the Premium Economy section and had no complaints. The food was fine as was the service. The aircraft was clean and the flight was smooth. Upon landing in Kona we went to pick up our bags but as luck would have it, ours and 40 other folks did not have any! As it turned out, these bags were left in Anchorage. Something to do with weight, headwinds or whatever. This was not something that we expected and we were not pleased but Alaska did try to meet our needs somewhat. We were offered either a coupon for $100 off a future ticket or 4 thousand miles on our Mileage Plan. I took the miles as did my wife. Our luggage was delivered the next afternoon. There were some folks who were quite upset over this and I felt bad for the employees having to try to meet their needs. Our stay in Kona was not good due to sickness for the entire 11 days but I must say it was a beautiful place, we plan to return and stay where we were this time. Kona is not a bad place to be sick I must admit! Our return trip went through Seattle and again we were in P/E section. Everything was fine, again a great crew, clean plane and wonderful service. We had a short time in SEA and then off to Anchorage. No problems encountered onboard. This plane had not been upgraded with the Premium section but we were fine. All in all, things were fine.

### "Alaska Airlines scam of premium seating"
Salt Lake City to Honolulu. Been trying to resolve this with Alaska Airlines since we got to Hawaii but they still aren't so I'm going to put this out there for my friends & family. I tried to do something awesome for my mom since it was her birthday and her first time to Hawaii so I upgraded our seats to "premium". Premium seats are terrible for the following reasons: If I can't store my carry on under the seat in front of me because it's a row behind first class which only has 2 seats then the seat isn't premium. If I have the "first class curtain" hanging in my lap and in my face every time someone walks through it then it's not a premium seat. If I have to go from row 7 all the way to the back of the plane to the lavatory, then the seat isn't premium. If it says I get chocolates, almonds & cranberries & what I get is 1 square of dark chocolate, a snack size bag of blue almonds (approximately $0.50) and a snack size bag of ocean spray cranberries (approximately $0.50) then it's not premium. If it says to power up with a power outlet at every seat but every seat on the whole plane has one including the regular fare seats then it's not premium. When it say complimentary drinks but the attendant comes by once the whole flight that's not premium. When it says I can recline but the seats only go back as far as the normal seats then it's not premium. When your web site advertises premium upgrades starting at $15 but I had to pay $150 per ticket, I should've already known it wasn't going to be a premium experience. Please do not fall for Alaska Airlines scam of premium seating!

### "When I booked it was a direct flight "
Seattle to Petersburg. Once aboard the plane, we had a stop in Ketchikan, before going on to Wrangler and to Petersburg. When I booked the tickets it was a direct flight to Petersburg. I found out that it was not at thw airport. Then they made us gather our stuff and made us move to different seats at Ketchikan. I think a warning that that was going to happen would have been nice. In this age of technology I would think that should not happen. That we should have been able to stay in the seats we started in. Disappointed.

### "attendants really kind and friendly"
San Diego to Newark. When I first got to the airport, I saw a 90 minute delay. I wasn't that happy, but Alaska Airlines kept us informed and boarded us as quickly as possible. Soon after the plane took off, they began the service. The snacks were good and they came around with drinks three times during the flight. I ordered one of their Signature fruit and cheese platters and I was shocked about how good it was. The flight attendants were really kind and friendly and seemed like that they loved their jobs. One thing I wasn't too happy about was that their IFE had a limited selection of programs and that you had to download this terrible app to use it. The flight was 4 hours and 19 minutes and would absolutely fly with them again.

### "hesitant to use Alaska again"
Seattle to Los Angeles. My flight was delayed and I missed several connecting flights, had to pay for a hostel I didn't stay in, a hotel for layover, missed my ride, missed classes, wasted a day of vacation, and have no time to settle in with my host family. I get that stuff happens but doing all you can to fix a wrong is appreciated and good costumer service. Alaska Airlines staff repeatedly told me it wasn't their fault but I'm the customer and it wasn't my fault either. If you provide a service sub par make it right and don't make a costumer feel like it was their mistake or that they have to pay for a mistake they didn't cause. I paid for a hotel and would have had to pay too much to get on the next flight out. That is unreasonable. I will be hesitant to use Alaska again.

### "a nice travel experience"
❎ Unverified |  Seattle to Ronald Reagan Washington Airport. Comfortable, clean, on time, great FAs. A direct service to Washington DCA Airport so short taxi ride to Capitol. Just a nice travel experience as always. Boardroom at Seattle is falling below the standards now set by the Amex Centurion lounge and the new Delta lounge - but no big deal.

### "never fly this airline again"
❎ Unverified |  Portland to New York JFK via Seattle. We showed up at Portland Airport for an 8pm flight. Our gate was switched twice, a sign of what was to come. As was the hard of hearing old man that the gate staff refused to help. The 8pm flight was delayed so badly that it became clear that we would miss our connection in Seattle. The bumbling idiots at the ticket counter couldn't figure out a solution to this issue, since their system doesn't link with better airlines (such as Jetblue). They put us up in a hotel for the night with the promise of a non-stop first class, 6:15am flight (to Newark, when our car was at JFK). Midway through the flight, we are diverted to Pittsburg, where we were trapped on the plane for 3 hours. After an announcement that we were going to Baltimore next, we took off for Newark, landing at 7:30pm . From 6:15am to 7:30, we were offered one fruit plate and some small snacks. We had to take a cab home. The next morning, we took a two buses and a train to our car at JFK . Mutiple calls to Alaskan airlines were met with indifference, attitude and a gusty offer to join their mileage program! I will never fly this airline again.

### "not let her mother go to meet her "
Salt Lake City to Los Angeles with Alaska Airlines. This was the second time my 13 year old went as an unaccompanied minor. And both times they would not let her mother go back to meet her at the gate without me having to call the airline and her having to get the manager at the airport. Both times I called to make sure it was done correctly. And both times it was done incorrectly I will not be using this airline again for an unaccompanied minor.

### "Outstanding customer service"
Seattle to Fairbanks. Outstanding customer service as always. Final leg of my flight from Tucson, AZ to Fairbanks, AK. Previous flights were with American Airlines who across the board were not very helpful. What set Alaska Airlines apart from the rest is their ability to tell customers what they can do, verses reiterating what they can't do. Alaska Airlines is flexible and values their flyers!

### "they had the family split up"
We booked our flights in July 2016 with Alaska. It's February 2017. From Kona to Seattle they had the family split up including our 5 year old. They did not care at all (that's the way flights work she said they have to make money). Then the flight attendant prosseded to give my 5 year old pop every time he would ask but my wife and I were not sitting in same row and could not see. My wife got to sit beside 2 people that had to use belt extensions - it was fun for her. When we got to Seattle they had seats for us - one for me but the kids and wife they oversold. They know when you book flights how old people are so the idea of splitting up a mother or father and a 5 year old is ridiculous. The other part is how do you oversell a seat when you book it 8 months early.

### "Alaska is my third choice"
Seattle to Los Angeles. Alaska Airlines has gotten better over the years but still has a ways to go. Many of their flights are still late and they generally do an awful job of updating the electronic screens at the gates. The screen will say a flight is boarding in 5 minutes when there isn't even a plane at the gate. It's also comical how Alaska charges most of their passengers to check a bag but then offers to do it for free as nearly every flight has issues with overhead bin space. So if you're flying Alaska check in online and choose zero bags to check. A screen or two later Alaska will usually offer to let you check your carry-on for free. And even if they don't, they almost certainly will offer to do so at the gate. Why not offer a free checked bag to everyone if you're going to offer that anyway? It's not fair to those who paid to check their bags. On the plus side their newest planes (the "next gen" 737-800 and -900) have more generous legroom and power at your seat. On the downside you have to use your own device for inflight entertainment. Alaska could learn something from Virgin American (which they now own). They do offer free (for now) streaming shows over WiFi but it's cumbersome, buggy, and you have to click past several screens trying to sell you GoGo inflight WiFi. While they offer a decent selection of paid food and beverages they have only a single food and beverage cart for the entire plane and a 737-900 is a long plane. So it takes something like 45 minutes for the service to work its way from the front to the back. But my biggest complaint about Alaska is they have many flights that are chronically late, yet they refuse to change the scheduled times. Even the flight crews have no explanation why they don't change the scheduled times. Southwest flies many of the same routes and puts Alaska to shame with their on-time record on those flights. And if anything goes wrong, like bad weather (we recently had snow in Seattle, for example) look out as Alaska turns into total chaos - especially at SeaTac. Wait times exceed one hour for calling them, lines stretch way down the hall from their customer service counters, their website falls on its face from the load, etc. And if you do stand in line for hours trying to rebook your cancelled, or infinitely delayed, flight, you're usually offered nothing useful and a joke of a customer care package. Basically they just seem not to care as they already have your money. Alaska charges at least $125 to make any changes to most flights and it's often horrifically expensive if you have to make a last minute change. This is in stark contrast to Southwest that charges no penalties for changes. Alaska's boarding is annoying with several "tiers" of preboarding which often amounts to at least a third of the plane with many of those people still blocking the aisles once they start general boarding. Again, Southwest is a far more pleasant and efficient experience. But airlines like United are even worse in this regard. Overall, for west coast travel I often have my pick of Southwest, Virgin America, Alaska, Delta, and United. And I try to book flights in that order of priority. Alaska is my third choice after Southwest and Virgin.

### "should be ashamed of overcharging"
❎ Unverified |  Seattle to Anchorage. Had to change flight to a later one with open seats. They wanted an additional 400 plus dollars as a change fee. I wish that the Seattle to Anchorage flight was covered by multiple carriers. Alaska Airlines has a monopoly on this route and can do whatever they want and I'm tired of them. You are a terrible airline and should be ashamed of overcharging.

### "agent was amazing"
San Jose to Vancouver via Seattle. The Alaska Airlines agent was amazing! Our flight was cancelled and she went above and beyond to rebook us and get a direct flight to Vancouver from San Fran. She could have easily brushed us off but chose to go the extra mile to make sure our vacation wasn't disrupted. We will definitely book with Alaska Airlines in the future. Thanks so much!

### "cabin crew are great"
This was a round trip from Philadelphia to Seattle and back with Alaska Airlines. It's my first time traveling domestically in US. I usually travel internationally and first time with Alaska Airlines. It was really nice service and airplanes were near new. Especially the B737-900. More leg room and inflight entertainment wifi was really nice. Cabin crew are great. Really friendly.

### "cabin crew are really great"
This was a round trip from Philadelphia to Seattle and back. Its my first time traveling domestically in US. I usually travel internationally, and my first time in Alaska airlines. It was really nice service and airplanes were near new. Especially Boeing 737-900. More leg room and inflight entertainment wifi was really nice. Cabin crew are really great. Really friendly. One thing I noticed that stands out really well is the appearance. They all look natural than over made up, which is really pleasing.

### "ended loyal use of Alaska Airlines"
❎ Unverified |  So disappointed after my most recent flying experience. Normally customer care with Alaska has been great, but not this time. I flew with a certified service animal from Dallas to Fairbanks via Seattle. On the plane from Dallas to Seattle my service animal (a large dog) were asked to deboard because they had sold the seat next to me. Both the gate agent and the reservations agent I spoke with encouraged me to buy an extra seat on the Seattle to Fairbanks flight to ensure there was room and stated a refund would be issued with no problems if there were open seats left on the flight. Upon calling for my refund because there were open seats, the customer care agent was extremely rude, said they would refund it only this once and never do that again. She proceeded to hang up on me and not confirm the refund. That topped off with the "don't bother me" attitude of half my flight attendants has ended my loyal use of Alaska Airlines.

### "Thanks for nothing"
Portland to Bellingham. Cancelled flight and they thought a meal voucher makes up for missing my family for another day. Ruined the end of a long business trip. Confusing process to get my baggage, find a hotel and get home at some point the next day. Thanks for nothing Alaska Airlines.

### "not fly this airline again"
Kailua Kona to Seattle. I'm so unimpressed with Alaska Airlines, and will never fly with them again. We didn't get the help we needed when our flight was canceled on January 1, 2017. I was told there were no flights out of Boise to Kona, which was false. I was able to book through United. Then, on my return flight we had zero explanation as to why we were not flying out on time. I tried to ask a staff to get me some water and she refused. The lack of care and unanswered questions is why I will not fly this airline again. I flew United to Kona and was very impressed with their service, not so much Alaska - even though I've been frequent flyer for 5 years.

### "Ground staff very friendly"
Eugene to Seattle. Flight was slightly delayed due to late arriving aircraft. Ground staff was very friendly but had to correct their own announcements. I am not sure if it was because they were nervous, but it seemed strange that they couldn't simply explain the new takeoff time in a simple and straightforward manner. I hate to dwell on this, however, as everything else went off without a hitch. No drink or snack service due to bumpy weather conditions.

### "become more dissatisfied"
Spokane to Portland. Alaska Airlines tends to provide pretty consistent service, but I have become more dissatisfied by their service. My wife and I had to commute from Spokane to Portland to get to work. The night before there was some snow but by the time we were going to leave it was clear. So like a typical there needs to be clearing of the runways, de-icing of the planes, etc., but it appeared that not only did they not take care of this prior to us boarding, but as we were boarding they still told us that we were leaving on time. Even after sitting on the plane 25 minutes after we were supposed to leave, we were finally told we were going to have to pull out on the side of the runway and wait another 40 minutes to de-ice and wait for the plane's oil to warm up. I understand that all these things need to happen and sometimes there's issues, it's just the poor preparation and the lack of communication that makes this service dissatisfying. We will continue to use Alaska Airlines as the have the best routes in the NW, but we will consider other airlines for non-NW travel.

### "had no complaints at all"
Returned very recently from a return trip to Nashville due to my father in laws passing. All trips were on Alaska Air. The trip down from Anchorage was with my wife and son and we picked up our daughter in Seattle. The next flight was to Nashville and we were in the new Premium Economy seats. Plenty of legroom, great service as usual and we were on time. After the service, we stayed in the Montgomery area for a few days visiting with family and tried to catch up on some sleep. We departed for our return to the Greatland on Christmas and needless to say things were pretty quiet at the three airports we were at. Again we were in Prem Economy and had no complaints at all. There were some bumps along the way to Seattle due to the weather systems but this occurs every once in awhile. Our daughter left us in SEA and my son and I were pleased to see we were bumped up to first for our trip to Anchorage. Our captain came on the intercom and thanked us for flying with he and his great crew. I would say that our flights on Alaska were fine all in all, nothing to complain about. The passengers and the crews who served us all seemed to be in the Christmas mood and this was helpful. Thanks Alaska once again for reminding us how flying should be in todays' world!

### "no room in overhead bins"
Seattle to Maztalan via Los Angeles. Flight to Maztalan was delayed 1.5 hours due to having de ice plane. Made it to LAX and the connecting flight to Maztalan was held for 53 people on Seattle flight. Pretty decent flight and then that evening I got a note promising a certificate of $75 off a future flight in a few days - that was 6th December, now its the 22 December and zip. Had a great time in Mexico, then the flight out of Mexico was delayed for no reason. We were able to upgrade to exit row#6. One thing I have noticed with carry on is some people that board first to the back rows are putting their carry ons in first overhead bins, I assume to avoid dragging their luggage up row while exiting - but then no room in overhead bins for people in rows behind first class. We landed in LA, sat on plane for 45 minutes while exit door was worked on only to be told we would be exiting from back of plane. OMG the people in back rows that put their bags up front now had to work their way up front to get their bags! No wonder people go insane. Customs was a nightmare, but thankfully my flight to Seattle was held.

### "they had to downgrade me"
Los Angeles to Liberia, Costa Rica. Horrible experience to say the least, I have complained once and more to come here. I bought 4 first class Alaska Airlines tickets to fly to Costa Rica and two month later I received a call that they had to downgrade me because they were overbooked. At that time I requested that if they were going to do the same flying back from there to Los Angeles to inform me then so I can change plans and confirmed that they wouldn't. Later they called me and said that they had equipment change so they have to downgrade me again on the return flight. Amazing, by then too late to have last minute changes during Christmas times. So I called and asked to at least put my name on the upgrade list in case they had room and they guaranteed that once at the airport I had to give my name again and they put my family on number 16 through 20 for waiting list. So I go to their first class lounge and they would not to let me in so I paid to Admiral club so we can get in. Please don't insult me with free offers but understand that there is a major break down in your system and nobody is empowered to make decision not even simplest ones.

### "misleading and uninformative"
Los Angeles to Mammoth Lakes. I purchased a ticket through American Airlines, received an email confirmation through American Airlines but was expected to know that I was supposed to go to the Alaskan airlines gate. So I walked from terminal 4 to terminal 6, checked my bags and got my boarding pass and went to gate 65A. I then asked the lady working at gate 65A where gate 65B was and how much time I had to board the plane. It was 7:40 at the time, my boarding pass said 8:10, she said that gate 65B was just right next to her. I went to the restroom and came back to gate 64A thinking gate 64B was right next to her based on the information given to me, to find out gate 64B was actually down the hall and around the corner. By the time I got to gate 64B it was 7:59. My friend told the lady working at gate 64B that I was in the restroom and I would be there in just a minute but they closed the flight anyway. I could see the plane right outside the door, about 40-50 feet away. It was a small plane with the step ladder still attached to it. They did not accommodate me in any way whatsoever. Very misleading and uninformative. I was scheduled to fly out and come back the same day so catching another flight wasn't an option. My trip was scrapped and subsequently ruined.

### "extremely impressed"
I just returned last night from a roundtrip from Phoenix to Seattle on Alaska Air for the first time. I have flown a lot on many airlines and I have to say, I will definitely fly Alaska everytime I can. I felt like I was launched back to the 80s and 90s when it seemed airlines really cared about their passengers. I can't say enough about the quality of the crew aboard each airplane. Remember the old days when you were told several times during the flight what was going on? Last night we experience turbulence on the flight and the captain announced to us more than once that it was going to be intermittent throughout the flight and why, jet stream winds that we were going through and not to worry as it would not get worse than what we were experiencing. He was very reassuring and kind. Also, when do you have the cockpit crew stand with the flight attendants as you are leaving the cabin to greet passengers? Extremely impressed! The absolute only negative is that the planes are a little old and the seats are not that comfortable, but each seat has an electrical plug and there is wifi on the airplane. I will definitely fly Alaska again. Also, we went into the Alaska Club in Seattle and were greeted warmly as we asked a few questions about becoming club member. The lades were wonderful and couldn't have been more helpful. I look forward to flying Alaska airlines again soon.

### "service is outstanding"
Just returned early this morning from a return to the Greatland with my wife from Nashville. Our original plan was to get back up here and leave in two days to Kona however life intervened and we now have to depart tomorrow back to Nashville due to the passing of her father. I was on the phone for over an hour dealing with an agent from Boise who was fantastic! She rebooked our Kona trip to March and got my wife, son and I out tomorrow evening to Seattle where we meet our daughter and then all of us to Nashville. The service this company provides is outstanding. Our flight out of Nashville eventually was fine as we were stuck on I-65 for three hours due to a huge wreck. We cut it a bit close but got out ok. The pilot reported that headwinds were going to be getting us in to SEA about 15-20 minutes late. This was not good to hear but we got down and they held the ANC flight for my wife and I and three others. I was very pleased. We got off the deck about 10 minutes late but arrived ontime in ANC. The planes were fine, clean etc. The food was good and the service was great. I thanked every employee who assisted us along our strange, winding road. Alaska Airlines, Thank You!

### "delayed without much explanation"
Seattle to Los Angeles with Alaska Airlines. Our flight was delayed 2.5 hours without much explanation. We got off for 1 hour but ended up sitting for 1.5 hours expecting to leave. Was very disappointed. I typically fly United and have done for 20 years on at least 5 flights a year (domestic and international) and never experienced this much delay!

### "would not recommend"
Kahului to Victoria via Seattle with Alaska Airlines. The first problem I encountered was that the online check in did not work, and when I called Alaska Airlines, they said they are having a glitch in their system and I should go to the counter in the airport to complete my check-in. When I went to the counter and explained the problem, the agent insisted that I need an ETA visa to enter Canada. I knew this was not correct, but she insisted I cannot received my boarding pass and I may need to cancel my flight. I had to purchase internet as the terminal does not have free access to WiFi in order to prove to her that I don’t need an ETA. Then finally, after 20 minutes, I find out they did not choose the right option in the check-in process and that was the cause of the discrepancy. A stressful and horrible experience, and would not recommend this airline.

### "the worst week of flying"
San Francisco to Seattle. I just had the worst week of flying Alaska Airlines ever. They cancelled my flight to the Bay area from Seattle on Tuesday because of the weather. In fact, it was cold but dry with no ice. They rebooked me on a flight for that evening, even though there were seats available on earlier flights. Coming home today, my flight was also cancelled. I was due to land at noon but there was a chance of snow in the evening, so I guess that was what they were worried about? Again, they automatically rebooked me but for 6:48 AM the next day (when there actually would be snow on the ground)! I spent 2.5 hours on the phone (from 11pm to 1:30am) trying to get through to customer service because they wouldn't let me rebook on line. I got up at 5amand finally made it through to them. By dressing and leaving within 10 minutes I was able to make the only flight available that day but I had to go to an airport further away than my original one. Virtually no other airlines were cancelling flights to and from Seattle at these times. Plan for the worst if you have Alaska Airlines booked in the Northwest.

### "another wonderful crew"
Anchorage to Nashville via Seattle. Once again I found myself flying with Alaska Airlines best. When I went to check in at the counter at Anchorage I was informed that my flight to Nashville was cancelled out of SeaTac. I had heard about some weather related problems which could possibly affect Alaska's flight operations there. I told the employee it was no issue as I could spent the night at the wonderful USO there. The flight was great - gracious crew, on time, clean plane etc. It was a redeye so we arrived at about 4:45 AM. I looked around and found no snow anywhere. I asked at customer service about this issue and was told that about 30 of their flight were affected. I asked why were other airlines apparently not affected and she had no idea. I was offered a coupon to stay locally but said no thanks and spent the next 26 hours at the USO, watching tv, talking with the folks and the great staff. The flight out to Nashville was fine with another wonderful crew. I had the BBQ sandwich and a beer. All in all this was good. I did note quite a few others on the flight were stuck in SEA overnight like I was. Other than holding folks up for 24 hours in SEA it appeared to be taken in stride. I will say that more than a few of us found the weather excuse to be somewhat strange though. Operations at other airlines were slowed down somewhat due to having to de-ice but no cancellations other than Alaska.

### "at the airport for 4 hours"
The Seattle to San Jose flight was cancelled at the last moment and although they were kind enough to book me in the next flight out, the seat provided was terrible. Due to this delay, I had to cancel a bunch of meetings at work. I understand that this happens once in a blue moon but still it was disappointing. Waiting at the airport for 4 hours.

### "could not have asked for anything better"
Dallas DFW to Seattle with Alaska Airlines. I was worried about moving at 70 and transporting my old dogs from Texas to Washington. They had to go in cargo. I did a lot of research before choosing Alaska Airlines. From the ticket agent to the pet crate exam to leaving my pets to the greeting on the plane to the confirmation they were loaded and the meal I had. I could not have asked for anything better. Will fly Alaska wherever possible.

### "choose another airline"
Eugene to Honolulu via Portland. As I touch down into Portland getting ready to catch my flight back to Eugene was informed that the plane is broken and has not left yet Boise. In the last 45 days, 3 flights that I know of from Portland to Eugene have been cancelled for various reasons. Today it was for my flight and the last two times were a best friend flying in from Boise coming through Portland to Eugene and I had to drive to Portland to pick her up, because the last flight coming out of Portland to Eugene was cancelled. This is becoming a regular habit with Alaska Airlines and I would suggest anyone needing to get to Eugene through Portland, especially later in the evening, choose another airline! Their smaller aircraft are getting old and they're having constant problems with them!

### "the only airline I can count on"
Bellingham to Houston IAH with Alaska Airlines. I have flown a lot in the past few years. I have used at least 15 airlines worldwide on these trips. Alaska Airlines is the only airline I can count on when it comes courtesy, timing, upgrades, inflight quality, scheduling, mileage plan, helpfulness, cost, efficiency, and just an overall best experience. If they flew everywhere I needed to go, I wouldn't ever use another airline.

### "a slap in the face"
I booked this flight online with Alaska air on June 14, 2016 for our family 4 to travel from Washington DC to Los Angeles, CA Oct 12 -19, 2016. The outbound flight was operated by American Airlines. I selected the seats so that family would be together. On July 15th and again August 11th I received an Email from Alaska Airlines that stated: "We need to let you know about a change in your itinerary. The details of the change are below, but rest assured you are booked on the closest available option to your original itinerary. Your new reservation is confirmed and you do not need to reconfirm. Then the email read: "Here is your updated flight information", which included the new flight #, the new flight time (less than 10 minutes time difference) and it listed our original seating arrangements. The day before the flight I wanted to be among the first to check in and print our boarding passes. To my surprise not only am I required to select seats, their were no seating options that keeps our family together without an additional fee. This change was not mention in the Email. In fact the email list in detail the original seating selections under "updated flight information". Now this 5 hour flight only have options that puts all 4 of us in middle seats scattered all over the airplane. I called Alaska Airlines representative who instructed me to call American Airlines. American Airlines said to contact the company I booked the flight with. I booked this trip with Alaska Airlines and therefore I expected them to fix this problem. It's very important to us that our family is seated together on our flight. Less than 24 hours before the trip we cant get a refund and we can't book a new trip without outrageous cost, so we flew without all of us being seated together. This was a very unpleasant way to start our vacation. We contacted Alaska Airlines and they apologized for the inconvenience and added "Unfortunately, our Customer Care department only handles post flight situations on Alaska Airlines operated flights. Have a good day sincerely , Customer Care Representative. That was a slap in the face.

### "am trying to get reimbursed"
I was to fly this airline from Santa Rosa to Los Angeles on Nov 13th. The flight was canceled do to weather. Because I had a flight back to Germany at 3 pm that day, I needed to get to LA. They rebooked me from SFO to LAX. I paid 25 dollars for a Bus company to get to SFO from Santa Rosa. When I got there I had to repay a baggage fee I already paid Alaskan Airlines. I got in. Now I got back and I am trying to get reimbursed for the bus fee and the extra bag fee. After waiting 30 minutes to get to the customer care. I was told they would reimburse my bag fee, but not the bus fee or any other fee I incurred. Not happy with their approach to this, nor the ladies attitude on the phone. I expected to be treated fairly. I paid a high price for the ticket to fly out of Santa Rosa. I could have booked the flight that I eventually took and paid 150 Dollars less. I know this cancellation was weather related. But I would have expected the airlines to pay a bill for 25 Dollars to help the excess cost that I had to take upon myself because of this situation. When I have a chance to pick airlines in the future, I will remember this event and choose accordingly.

### "planes and crews were great"
Anchorage to Nashville via Seattle. Another great trip with Alaska Airlines. The flight down to SEA was on their Combi 400 the cargo / passenger plane. Nice flight with a great seatmate. Arrival was early as it was a redeye. Spent some quality time at the Boardroom as I usually do - no issues there. I was bumped up to First on the leg to BNA. The crew and service was great, no problems noted. I arrived on time and thanked the crewmembers for the great service. The return to ANC was a bit unusual for me this time as I flew to SEA spent the night and then departed the next morning. The flight began about 30 minutes late due to storm issues in Seattle which caused some backup in the system but it was no problem on my end. The flight was quite bumpy in parts but no problems. The service was great as was the food. Arriving in SEA I slepped over to the fine USO located there and spent the evening talking with the outstanding staff and various Soldiers, Sailors, Marines and Airmen who were enjoying the hospitality as I was. I got to my 8:30 AM flight and had the pleasure of sitting next to a fine Alaska attendant who was heading back to the Greatland. As I was departing the aircraft in ANC she noticed my wallet which had departed my pocket somehow and got it back to me. My only issue was at baggage claim. I watched the clock countdown and my bag got there in 21 minutes. As this was not the 20 minutes they strive for I grabbed my bag and went to get my 2500 miles added to my account. The young lady working there said they had made it as they did not go by the time which was at the claim area they go by another clock apparently which us passengers are not aware of. The lady in front of me was not pleased and neither was I. I told her as a Gold member this was the first time I had run into this issue and it sort of sounded like false advertising. I decided to not raise hell as I was tired and needed to get on the road home. All in all, the flights, planes and crews were great and I was pleased to be in Alaska Country again!

### "maintenance problems guaranteed"
Every time I fly Alaska to Spokane they are late, and if you are traveling on a Sunday night there will be maintenance problems guaranteed. My last three flights with Alaska on a Sunday night have all departed two hours after the scheduled departure time. Alaska, what is going on, do you not care about the leisure traveler to Spokane. I don't fly very much but when I do with you I can guarantee you will screw me over for the Seattle to Spokane flight on a Sunday night!

### "staff should be congratulated"
Our international flight into SFO had been delayed and arrived too late to connect to our flight to Portland. As the Alaska Airlines flight had been booked separately, I expected no sympathy from them. To my delight, they were very sympathetic and understanding. They tried to get us on the next available flight, but in the end we had to take the last flight of the day. All the same, we were extremely grateful to arrive in PDX on the day we had planned. The desk staff should be congratulated for their efficiency and courtesy; not the mention the flight itself was very pleasant, too.

### "was not First Class travel"
Honolulu to Seattle. After paying for a full fare First Class ticket on the above referenced flight we were subjected to 5 hours of a screaming infant. Not an hour, not intermittent, but five straight hours. It’s bad enough Alaska Airlines allowed three other under six year olds in First Class but when did they waive a First Class age limit and allow infants? Passengers pay for first class to avoid those annoyances. We do so with an expectation of first class service. Instead, for a six hour flight we got cramped seating, two cold pancakes and a screaming infant. It was not First Class travel.

### "didn't dare bother a stewardess"
On a 45-minute KLM flight the crew served choice of beverage and snack, while on connexion Alaska Airlines flight of 82 mins from San Francisco to Palm Springs on Alaska, no one smiled, you could only choose OJ or water, and they started to prepare for landing 30 mins before actual landing so they could go back to their jumpseats and chat about their schedules. Also, there was supposed to be electrical outlets at each seat, but there wasn't any I could find and I didn't dare bother a stewardess with a question about their aircraft.

### "choose whenever possible"
San Diego to Seattle. Alaska is the airline I choose whenever possible. Employees are, overall, friendly and helpful each time I have flown. I'm not pleased to pay for luggage, however. If I check my bag there is a $25 fee. If I take my bag to the plane, I'm offered the option of a "courtesy check" because the flight is full - there is no cost for this service. On my recent outgoing flight, I was offered the courtesy check online when I checked in to print my boarding pass. On the return flight, I was not offered this option and was required to pay the $25. Please go back to free first checked bag to provide equity for all passengers and to keep the overhead bins from being so full.

### "great crew, service and attitude"
Once again flew what has become my favorite airline to Las Vegas from Anchorage, via Seattle. The flight down was a redeye but who cares? I had a great seatmate and we talked about many things to pass some of the time. Upon landing in Seattle I grabbed a coffee and waited for my daughter who was going with me. This would be our third trip to Sin City this year. I was bumped up to First Class on this leg and once again the service was great, nothing to complain about. Our stay in Vegas was fun, after eating well and losing some dough, it was time to return home. The flight to Seattle departed an hour late due to ATC issues in Seattle but it was great as I was able to catch my connection to Anchorage w/o a hitch. Bumped to First again (I am getting used to this!). Great crew, service and attitude. I thanked them as I always try to do for their wonderful service. Keep it up Alaska Airlines.

### "avoid if at all possible"
Mammoth Lakes to Los Angeles LAX with Alaska Airlines. Flight cancelled. Terrible service. No support. Now in SAN same dreadful customer service. Despite canceling flight and only offering alternative flight in 3 days time, not able to use credit towards baggage charge for next flight. Not sure why anyone would travel with Alaska. I would avoid if at all possible.

### "Slowest website I have ever seen"
Phoenix to Seattle. Alaska Airlines flights are normally ok. Slowest website I have ever seen. I acquired a Alaska visa card 2 months ago with the 30,000 miles offer. I was supposed to spend $1000 within 90 days to get the miles. Have spent in excess of $2,000 and no mileage credit yet. If you can contact them they will blame Bank of America who will in turn say they only provide information to Alaska on the "billing cycle" so if that does not come around before 90 days I do not get the bonus mileage. I have a mileage account with a credit union and purchases are posted within a week. Will discontinue the card if not straightened out soon. Cannot believe a major airline has a website this slow and hard to navigate.

### "they've been going downhill"
Newark to Yakima. Alaska Airlines is awful. I've primarily flown with them for the past 25 years and they've been going downhill. They don't allow passengers on board during the boarding time, close doors early at airports, charge exorbitant fees for luggage (food, liquor, etc). They tell people to go to the customer service desk, which isn't even open, don't give options when they won't allow you on a flight that they've randomly decided you can't board because they've closed the doors early, and offer you a 50$ refund when you need to rent a car to dive over 4 hours because of it. They don't offer hotel stays, free luggage, or anything. This has gone from being the best airline, to being the worst airline, over the last 25 years. They have a "20 minute" baggage guarantee, which always takes longer and they never honor. They charge 100$ for a 20 min flight because they're the only airline that flies out of my small town. I refuse to fly with them anymore.

### "surprised by the good service"
This was my first time flying Alaska Airlines and I was happily surprised by the good service flying from Tampa to Seattle. I was offered free drinks twice and got free pretzels. All the staff were nice and when my carry on bag didn't fit in the stowage area, the steward checked it in for me free. It was a pleasant flight - free charging, free wifi and $10 entertainment tablet rental (which was worth it in my opinion). Great airline.

### "staff were helpful and polite"
Had a very comfortable flight with Alaska Airlines from Anchorage to Seattle. The staff were helpful and polite. The pilot gave a great commentary about the sights from the plane although it was often hard to hear him. Food and service were excellent. Seat was comfortable and we left Anchorage on time. Would highly recommend.

### "great service from wonderful crew"
Oakland, California to Honolulu, Hawaii. Great service from the wonderful crew, who provided excellent service from the pre-flight safety instructions, to the cocktail service, to the meals and entertainment. I would happily recommend this airline to others and can't wait to fly first class in Alaska Airlines next time I travel. Travel with my handicapped mother was not a problem as the airport staff meet her with a wheelchair and helped with all of our luggage and travel arrangements to the hotel. Thanks Alaska!

### "1st class is not worth the money"
Los Angeles to Puerto Vallarta. I'm going to say Alaska Airlines 1st class is not worth the money for a number of reasons. Here's my observations from Seat 4D. No immediate service. No drinks/snacks as people are boarding. A usual perk of 1st. Personal entertainment devices aren't always available. (Even when they say you have your own). There is no difference in extra leg room between 1st and economy plus. Just 2 seats a row instead of 3, which is nice, but not for the price difference. Service onboard is not first class quality when compared to Delta, Virgin, Air New Zealand (to name a few). Not even close. Food, drinks, services just not that special. Alaska sells off vacant 1st class seats at the last moment if they're available for $50. This is painful. Great for the person who gets a $1000 seat for $50 - not good when you pay a premium for peace and quiet. But, it explains why they don't care about good service in 1st. Alaska needs to step it up. A "wider" seat just isn't worth the premium price.

### "service on board was excellent"
Albuquerque to Seattle return, Boeing 737-900. First Class. My new favorite airline in the US. Great experience. New aircraft. Very comfortable seating, we were in row 2. The service on board was excellent both ways. They serve actual, hot food on proper crockery with real cutlery. Chicken with rice to Seattle and a Tortellini to Albuquerque. Flight deck would announce points of interest and of course, they did a great job in getting us there and back safely. The Wi-Fi on board worked very well. I would rate Alaska Airlines as the best airline in the US for domestic travel.

### "decent crew and good value"
AS 3380, Portland - San Jose, operated by Skywest. Check in at PDX was extremely smooth and efficient, so we had an hour to spare before boarding. Boarding was out of the cramped concourse A and began 10 minutes late with no explanation. Once aboard, the E175 was in good condition and was extremely spacious, even more so than the 737 on the outbound flight, although the overhead bins were small. A weight balance issue resulted in several passengers in the last few rows having to move forward, this took a while as FA's had to recruit volunteers and people were stubborn. Fortunately, we still managed to push back within 15 minutes of scheduled departure and were airborne after a short taxi. Cabin crew were nice, but they could have managed the timing of the short flight better. They spent the first half of the flight chatting in the galley. A small snack with the beverage was a nice touch, but it didn't start until halfway through the flight. Literally right after they finished the beverage service, a flight attendant came through with a trash bag when most people were not even finished, so most had to sit with trash on their traytables while the FA's resumed chatting in the galley. They had more than enough time to get the service done as the FA's on the outbound leg easily served an aircraft twice the size and we still had 20 minutes after the service during cruise. Finally, during final approach, they realized we needed them to collect the rubbish and did so. We landed in San Jose 20 minutes ahead of schedule, and they made sure to brag about Alaska's on-time performance flightstats award. Overall, AS will get you from Point A to B reliably with decent crew and good value, but they shouldn't sell themselves as a major legacy airline when they are really just a decent budget airline. While AS is certainly not bad, I usually try to book with Jetblue or Virgin America due to their combination of a low fare with great service. In summary, I recommend AS for shorter flights, but beware for transcons or Hawaii.

### "snacks provided on short flights"
Edmonton to Los Angeles via Seatlle. I found Alaska Airlines to be fairly average, snacks were provided on short flights, baggage allowance was ok, inflight selection of movies was good, cabin crew were decent, the flight arrived on time and the same is true for the for the arrival time.

### "service attentive, sociable and friendly"
My husband and I flew Alaska Airlines from Seattle to Juneau. We were upgraded to the first class because of my husband's frequent flyer's status. There was one main flight attendant (assisted by another occasionally). Staff member was awesome. PA announcements were serious and yet funny so much so I actually paid attention. Service was attentive, sociable and friendly. The food was great. I had been impressed with Alaska Airlines and their services, and still am.

### "seat pitch was reasonable"
San Jose - Portland, AS 405. Check in at SJC was a bit chaotic as there was little signage or explanation of the procedure for those who had checked in online. This created a mass of confused people looking for the bag drop. Once past security, the gate agent proceeded to yell all of the boarding groups instead of just using the PA. This was a bit bizarre since she used it for a couple of other announcements. Although old, the B737-400 was in decent condition for its age. Only issue in that respect was that my armrest was loose. Seat pitch was reasonable for someone who is 6'0", especially considering the short duration of flight. We departed on time, but the aircraft PA volume was so low that passengers could barely hear announcements. Cabin crew also failed to enforce important safety regulations such as windowshades being drawn up for takeoff and landing. (So that people can easily see out in case of an evacuation). However, they did manage the short flight time extremely well regarding the beverage service. They all were extremely polite and genuine. This genuine caring among its cabin crews is one of Alaska's major strengths. We landed on time in PDX with the 20-minute baggage guarentee being met. Overall a nice short hop. Only improvements: better safety training for employees and they should expedite the replacement of such old planes.

### "a great experience"
Well, spoiled again from Alaska Airlines. Flew out at 12.15am to Seattle in First (bumped up). Had a nice flight, crew were wonderful, plane clean, great service. Everything was fine overall, a few bumps in the air but that occurs every now and then. In SEA a few minutes early but so what, I had a four hour layover until my flight to Raleigh so I headed over to the Boardroom and was there when they opened up. Nice place to relax and chill. The experience was great. My next flight to Raleigh again was up in First and I enjoyed it completely. Our attendant was great as was the food. The pilot was quite outgoing and kept us up to date as to where we were and how soon we would land etc. There were quite a few thunder-boomers in the area so we got to dance around them for a while. I found it enjoyable but that was not to everyone's liking I could tell. We arrived on-time anyway. I was pretty tired and looked forward to sleep. All in all, a great experience.

### "you know how to move me"
I returned early this past Saturday from my trip to BNA via Seattle. Everything was fine overall. The crews were professional, polite and focused on customer care. The aircraft had no issues in either direction and were clean. The seats were great, 7F in all cases, and I had an enjoyable time talking to my seatmates. Our pilots kept us informed as to where we were and if any bumps were expected. I depart late tonight for RDU via SEA and noticed I have been upgraded to First again. Alaska, you know how to move me!

### "plane was clean"
Flew San Jose to Kahului. Great flight. Everyone was helpful, plane was clean and the movie tablets they handed out (for a charge) made the time pass fast. We got our seats all by each other with no problem and boarding the plane went smoothly. Our flight were on time and we would recommend Alaska Airlines.

### "service with a smile"
Juneau to Anchorage and my first flight with Alaska Airlines - it was excellent. The pilot stood at the front and welcomed everyone and talked about the route. The cabin crew were friendly and even found time to write a list of sights to see for a couple sitting in front of us. Service with a smile. The flight was short  just time for a hot drink and biscuit. I will certainly use them again on my next trip to Alaska.

### "service attitude was good"
Flew Anchorage to Las Vegas. This was an overnight flight of 4 and a half hour, plus 2 hours of time zone adjustment so the flight departed at 11.30pm arrived at 5.30am. It was on time. Alaskan Airlines has a good reputation and service attitude was good. Non-alcoholic drinks were served free several times during the flight, while others were available at reasonable cost. The checked bag cost USD25. It would be a good flight were it not due to the aircraft. It must be an early 737 and there was no TV, the seat back doesn't recline, making the 4-hr flight uncomfortable, though seat pitch was good. Overall, I was satisfied with this fight due to good service.

### "seats miserably uncomfortable"
Portland to Dallas Fort Worth with Alaska Airlines. We flew paid first class in seats 2A and 2C. Prior to departure we were in the PDX Alaska Board Room (paid membership). The place was dirty. Boarding was slow, mainly because there seems to have been only one gate agent working a full flight. As a result, we pushed back about 15 minutes late. The gate agent acted as though we were a bother to her - a real attitude issue. The four FA's working the flight were more interested in chatting with each other and constantly checking their iPhones, than interacting with passengers. This was particularly true later in the flight when the FA's gathered in the forward galley for a chat-fest. Our seating area was filthy, with coffee stains and food crumbs on the tray tables and the area between the seats The IFE on Alaska is woefully inadequate; in 1st, you are offered a DigEPlayer (like a small tablet) preloaded with content. Your other choice is to stream content on your own device, but to do so, you must pay for it. This is inferior to the AVOD on American and Delta that is complimentary in 1st. First class catering (lunch) was a joke - a warm turkey sandwich. It was the one and only option. The worst part of the trip was the seating on the Boeing 737-900. First off, the 737-800/900 seat pitch on Alaska is less than on Delta and far less than on American. Moreover, the first class seats would not recline. The seats were miserably uncomfortable and inferior to the seats used by American and Delta. We paid for our first class seats - we did not upgrade, and it was pretty evident by the time we landed in DFW that we would have been better off flying American

### "flew my favorite airline"
I flew my favorite airline once again to Las Vegas. My flight to SEA was up in First Class as I was bumped due to my Gold status. The flight departed on time at 5am which was not too fun. The customer care was great as usual though - everyone was a bit on the tired side upon our arrival. I had a couple of hour wait until my next flight, grabbed some coffee and watched the hustle bustle of those around me trying to catch their flights off to different parts of the globe. My flight to LAS departed on time with a great crew. A few bumps here and there but all in all no problems. I met my daughter there who had taken a early flight out of SEA and off we went. While in Vegas we managed to get out and see a show and it was very nice. I would also mention that we used Uber and Lyft while there. I had never used such service before and was very impressed - I also enjoyed saving money too, about 50% of the cab fare! On time out of LAS and early into SEA, and I went to the new Boardroom in the North terminal and had some refreshments, (the soup was great) chatted with some fine Alaskans waiting to catch flights and thanked the folks who work there for their customer service. I departed on my last flight back on time, had perfect service and was recognized by one of the cabin crew who thanked me for continuing to fly on Alaska. I thanked her and mentioned I have two more trips coming up, one to BNA and another to RDU. I cannot wait!

### "worst airline I have flown"
Seattle to Hawaii with Alaska Airlines. This will have to be the worst airline I have ever flown with. I had flights booked from months prior to travel. Myself and my friend were advised at the airport that the plane was full and we were on hold for seats. At the end of boarding we received our seats which were seated at opposite ends of the plane. No in-flight entertainment, and unfriendly staff. Would not recommend at all.

### "only had stellar service"
As a long time Alaska Airlines customer, I thought it fitting that I should offer some accolades for service well deserving. It has been many years since I started flying Alaska and I have only had stellar service. From the baggage handlers to the Board Room lounge attendants, I have been always treated well. My most recent flight from Vancouver to Los Angeles was no exception - excellent. I do fly internationally several times each month and feel like flying Alaska is like coming home.

### "cabin attendant exceptional"
Returned early this morning on Alaska Airlines from Nashville via Seattle. All flights went very well overall. I was upgraded on three of the four flights to First class and enjoyed the comfort, great service and fine food. Our cabin attendant was exceptional, in attitude and service - could not have asked for more. All of the flights were on time or arrived early. The planes were clean, crews were great and things went fine.

### "so accommodating to me"
I recently traveled with Alaska Airlines with my ESA and It was so nice that the airline was so accommodating to me and my service animal. From the phone reservation all the way to boarding my plane everything was a smooth transition and I had no problems at all. I also received a larger seating area so that my animal had enough room to lay down and I felt like the space was the perfect amount of space for her. I would definitely use Alaska Airlines again in the future. Everyone was nice, polite and helpful.

### "considering another airline"
Flew for vacation with Alaska Airlines from Edmonton to Lihue. Previous experience had been good. Our connector flight into Seattle was diverted to Portland which caused us to miss our flight to Lihue. When AA got us to Seattle, they were able to place us on a later flight to Lihue, but in coach not first class that we had booked and paid for. Three calls to customer service has netted results. Certainly will be considering another airline for this route in the future as I am not happy to be treated like this.

### "they put customers first"
Flew Alaska Airlines down to Las Vegas via Seattle to celebrate my daughters 21st birthday. I met her at SeaTac after flying in from Anchorage. My flight down was fine except for the very rough air 20 minutes north of SEA. The pilot warned us about it and we all did ok. Our next flight was great, plane was clean, service was fine and other than a few bumps all was good. After being up all night, it was great to check in at our hotel/casino and relax. We had a fine couple of days, ate well and returned with most of the money we started with which is always nice. Our return was interesting as I was bumped up to First for both of the flights and my daughter was in coach (to Seattle). I told her she could take my seat but she declined. The flights were once again very nice. No issues at all to complain about. Mostly smooth air, no spilled drinks or food, the crews were professional and hard working. It continues to be an airline that remembers to put customers first in their thoughts and actions. I received my baggage a few minutes after the 20 minute guarantee which was fine. I will take the 2500 miles and add it to my account. Thanks Alaska for your great service, fine planes and crews and attitude!

### "treated with respect"
Newark to Seattle with Alaska Airlines, and the flights were perfect. The staff could not do enough for us, and it reminded me of the old days when flying you were treated with respect and kindness. The food was good and the plane was immaculate. Seats were a bit narrow but I sat by the bul head and the leg room was wonderful.

### "worst flight experience"
This was the first time that I was flying on Alaska Airlines. The first flight from Kahului was fine but when I arrived in San Diego it was horrible. After having a six hour layover in San Diego, turns out that the flight that I had been waiting for had a mechanical error and they ended up sending a smaller plane instead. I almost didn't have a seat because the gate agent said that I didn't check in early enough to have my seat and I and 11 other people who also paid for a seat were basically on standby. The worst thing was, I checked in the day before so how dare they tell me that I didn't check in early enough to get a seat. And the seat that I had originally booked, that said it was my confirmed seat, was given to the first person on the wait list. To anybody who is thinking of flying Alaska, don't. This was the worst flight experience I had ever had and I'm a frequent flyer.

### "an excellent experience"
Seattle to Los Angeles, and this was my first experience flying with Alaska Airlines, and overall it was an excellent experience. The plane was clean and comfortable (it was one of the newest planes in the Alaska Airlines fleet, and our pilot half-jokingly reminded us to keep it clean as a result! ), and the flight attendants were great. The inflight entertainment system worked really well with my Android phone (Samsung Galaxy S6), and it was great having chargers with each seat, so that I didn't drain my battery life while watching TV shows or movies during the flight. It's also nice to have a number of free viewing options, along with full WiFi and additional movie/TV show options available (for an extra fee). I have nothing bad to say about my first Alaska Airlines experience, and do plan on flying with them again in the future.

### "service experience is superior"
Excellent service as usual from Seattle to San Diego. Whenever there is an opportunity to fly Alaska we do so even if the fare is not the cheapest because the service experience is always far superior to the other airlines. Virgin America is great too but has limited destinations - so therefore Alaska, together with their mileage program, is always the preference. They were serving a red wine by Browne Vineyards not the usual cheap stuff that other airlines serve - even in international biz class.

### "still had the new plane smell"
This was my eleventh and final trip this year. As a retired guy I have plenty of time on my hands, so I check out various airline vacation deals. I noticed a great deal to Las Vegas with Alaska Vacations. Departing on Monday, we flew to Portland on a daylight flight. The crew, plane and service was just fine all the way around. Landing at PDX we noticed how much rain the area had been receiving - what a mess. The airport was fine. We were there about an hour before we departed to the land of Lost Wages. The pilot informed us that the climb out may be a bit on the bumpy side and we had to stay at a lower altitude the entire way due to upper level turbulence. It was not bad at all. On our return, our departure flight was to be a bit on the bumpy side but we had been warned of this. Just prior to departing the pilot came out and talked to us about his 26 years of experience with Alaska and how much he, his co-pilot and crew appreciated our flying with them. I have seen this a couple of other times and I was impressed. The flight to SEA was great. Our departing Seattle was expected to be rough and we were informed that we would climb out at a lower altitude for some distance due to expected rough air, not bad though. We were on a new 737-900 which had been in service for about six weeks, still had the new plane smell. Everything worked great - the service, the food, our luggage arriving with us was a bonus as I was fairly certain it might not. All in all, the flights were great, the Vacation package was great pricewise and above all, Alaska continued to provide what I have come to expect, "Service With Pride".

### "a first rate job"
My son and I flew down to SDF from ANC via ORD during Thanksgiving. I cannot say that ORD was fun that is for sure as they had a huge snowstorm on Saturday and it was a mess. The flight down on Alaska Airlines was fine as my son and I were bumped up to First. The service was great, the crew members were professional and caring. Everyone just wanted to sleep and that was fine with me as well. We arrived a bit early and had to wait awhile for our gate but no problem. We had a few hours to kill so we ate at Wolfgang P. and that was quite good. I enjoyed a breakfast Pizza. The flight to SDF was on American Air E-175. Decent overall, no complaints. Our return to ANC was uneventful for the most part. The Alaska Airlines flight departed on time from ORD. The flight had us in First again and the service was great. I did not eat the food as I had something prior to boarding. I watched a movie and then tried to watch a second one but my digiplayer froze up. There was a call for any medical persons on board as a young lady had a heart issue. It turned out to be fine, she was checked out by medics when we landed in Anchorage and did not have any further problems. All in all another series of great flights on Alaska Airlines. Fine, clean planes crewed by professionals who cared for their passengers - a first rate job! Thanks!

### "with wonderful employees"
My appreciation goes to Capt Hendricks who piloted the plane from Portland to Boston. There were mechanical issues that delayed the plane for a little over 2 hours. The Captain Hendricks the issues to the passengers in a friendly, concise and comforting manner. He kept us updated throughout the repair process. His reassuring manner relaxed me and helped to keep everyone calm and in good spirits even though we had to disembark the plane for a time period. I want to also thank Alaska Airlines for the food voucher and for the voucher for a future flight. A great airline with wonderful employees.

### "great domestic service"
Alaska Airlines has great domestic service. I fly them every time to Seattle and anywhere else if I can. The flight attendants are friendly. I use my miles and it is very easy. The airline provided complimentary beer or wine which is nice. I like the fact they would give us updates or the pilot would tell us weather conditions. They arrive usually early which is great. When departing the plane it's easy to grab your bag on the cart.

### "understanding and sympathetic"
All set to leave in morning to airport for our Seattle to Las Vegas flight. Discovered my husband lost his ID. Today is a holiday so all hopes of our back up ID out of safety box at bank or DOL were out. Alaska Airlines refunded all my miles and cash I paid. They were very understanding and sympathetic. My first trip with hubby in 24 years. I will keep earning my miles and try again. Thank you customer service. You rock.

### "disregard for passenger comfort"
Our flight #121 from Seattle to Anchorage was not only approx an hour and a half late but we also shared half the aircraft with a load of freight? To add insult to injury, the constant loud chatter of the stewardesses made it impossible to try to catch a few winks before our anticipated 1.30am arrival in Anchorage. The complete disregard for passenger comfort and well being was such a huge contrast to our prior experiences with Alaska Airlines which have consistently exceeded our expectations. As a result, we will not be travelling long distance with Alaska Airlines in future.

### "pleased once again with Alaska"
Returned last night from Seattle with Alaska Airlines after visiting my daughter there. The flights were fine in both directions. I had hoped to get bumped up to First, however, that did not happen. I was pleased with seat 8F down and 9F back. There is only so much the flight crews can do on redeye flights but I will say the flight crew on the way back to the Greatland was impressive as one of the passengers two rows up from me experienced some type of medical issue. Three of the four attendants worked with him and all went well upon our arrival. We were ontime and had snow waiting for us - how nice. My bag was about one minute late so I received my 2500 mile voucher. I informed some of the other passengers who were waiting with me and they too got miles. I read the review of the unhappy customer who flew to Mexico recently, I have to say that the issue of paying for anything in First Class is incorrect based on my experience. You will hear back from their Customer Service folks and they will do what it takes to make things right for you. I hope it does. Anyhow, I am pleased once again with Alaska and look forward to my next flying experience to Chicago at Thanksgiving.

### "nice and well trained staff"
I'm throughly impressed, my last 2 flights were with Delta and they were just horrible. From being told that my seat was sold to a different person and I'd have to rebook a different day to getting to an Alaska Airlines flight and getting seated fast and being appreciated for being in the military, it's refreshing to have such a nice and well trained staff that suits in customers in every way possible. Thank you

### "it wasn't professional"
The seats were uncomfortable, barely reclined and featured an "innovative" design to provide 3" of leg room. I'm tall and I would expect 1st class to provide extra leg room. Not on Alaska Airlines. My knees were crushed for a good part of the flight. Food, other than soft drinks all other beverages cost. Nothing was complimentary. The meal was a TexMex Salad that was mostly a pile of lettuce with cheese on top. A prepackaged cookie was thrown in. Coach had options better than First class. Upon asking for some fruit from coach I was told "we'll see" and it was going to cost me extra. Coffee was never offered and upon asking I was told maybe they had some in coach but they were out. Little to no complimentary inflight entertainment. That was going to cost too. As soon as we were over Mexican airspace the whole system went dead. No wifi. Not even when flying in American airspace. If it was offered, as apparently it was on some flights, it was going to cost. After meal service, I couldn't get a even a small bag of pretzels. No effort was made to make the flight more comfortable or to provide any alternative food. The crew was friendly enough but seemed inexperienced in providing any first class service. Oddly the flight began with an announcement from the pilot (male) on how attractive the all female flight crew was. I felt as if I had stepped back 50 years. Though minor, it wasn't appropriate or professional. My expectations for first class aren't all that high. A comfortable seat, plenty of leg room, complimentary beverages (inc wine), somewhat of a more substantial meal than you would receive in coach and at the very least a flight crew that tried to make your flight as pleasant as possible. Alaska Airlines provided non of these. No blanket or pillow, nothing to read - having to beg for coffee? And above all else I conveyed this info to Alaska Corporate/Customer Care. Nothing from them with even a hint they might want to retain a customer. If you are going to spend the extra money to arrive refreshed via flying first class, heed my advice, find another airline. I've never been disappointed by Virgin America. United, which is doing the bare minimum at least is providing the bare minimum. There is nothing 1st class about this airline.

### "everything went well"
Just returned from an all day and most of the night flight back to the Greatland from Raleigh Durham, NC with Alaska Airlines. Most everything went well with small exceptions. The flight crews did their jobs well, professionally, and with great attitudes. The flight back up to Anchorage had to stay at a lower altitude due to rough air however the pilot informed us of this just prior to lift off. All in all it was fine. The meal on the flight from Raleigh was quite tasty and desert was too. Flying back to SeaTac this Sunday morning to visit my daughter and of course it will be on Alaska.

### "service has deteriorated"
For years my family and I have flown on Alaska Airlines. The service has deteriorated to the point where I want to scream. Flying from Anchorage to Seattle is about 4 hours of absolute misery. The seats are tiny and hard. I was miserable after a couple of hours. Staff sighs snarky, rude and I don't give a damn! I had the beverage cart slam into my shoulder and the crew member said "stay out of the aisle.  I might add that there were 3 larger people in this row. I was trying to give everyone a bit of room. I'm flying down to Costa Rica at the end of October on Alaska via milage plan. Who knows what is in store for me - perhaps I'll upgrade to 1st class.

### "I was very pleased"
I have flown a lot but this was my first experience with Alaska Airlines. We flew with our baby. I was very pleased that they were able to give us a row. The seats were the most comfortable coach seats I've sat in. We're both a little tall, my husband is 6'3", and he had enough room to stretch his legs out in front of him without his knees touching. The food offered was limited but good. The staff was the most friendly staff I've ever encountered flying in 25 years. Our flights were on time. They arrived a bit early at the destination. The best part was the changing table in the bathroom. The prices were the best offered for the trip we shopped for too. I sat on that plane looking forward to leaving a review, they were that good.

### "wonderful trip on Alaska"
Another wonderful trip on Alaska. The flight from ANC to SEA was great, the crew was excellent, flight was on time, all in all no complaints whatsoever. I was looking forward to the next flight, SEA to Raleigh as this was the first time Alaska flew there. They had a nice going away ceremony at the gate with all sorts of breakfast items, short speeches and a ribbon cutting as well. The aircraft we flew on was the special Russell Williams plane which I think is the 900 model of the 737. It was quite the arrival in RDU! Although it was raining upon our arrival, there were numerous television crews both outside and inside to catch shots of the plane, crew and passengers. The RDU folks that greeted us, (about 75 or so) lined up, gave each of us a welcome to Raleigh bag of goodies plus clapped and cheered for us. I was amazed at the welcome - Southern Hospitality at its best! The only downside was that our luggage did not get to the passengers within the 20 minute guarantee. We each received the 2500 mile ticket to apply to our Mileage Plan - it's all good. The flight there was great by the way - 4 hours and 26 minutes with very little to gripe about. I believe that this route will do well as Raleigh is quite a nice destination, great airport and easy access to the car rental facilities/freeways.

### "the most amazing experience"
This was my first time on Alaska Airlines and I have to say it was the most amazing experience on an airplane. The amenities, the food, the airline stewards, the pilots - all  of it was perfect! We were comfortable, attended to, acknowledged, and treated extremely kindly.

### "was such a pleasure"
It was such a pleasure to step foot onto Alaska Airlines to Seattle. Everything from check in, staff, tidy planes and friendly onboard service I cannot fault. Both flights departed early and arrived early. The crew were in the cabin interacting with the passengers.

### "the service is wonderful"
The level of Alaskan Airlines service is great. The flight to Portland was a small plane with no first class, but for such a short flight it was absolutely fine. The Portland to Maui sector was wonderful. The staff are the most attentive and helpful I have travelled with. The food was to a high standard with a few choices. The drinks were served on a regular basis and the chocolate snacks are great. The seating is comfortable with adequate leg room and I found the entertainment notebooks really easy to use and the content was current films and tv programmes. The service is wonderful!

### "I only have great things to say"
When I rushed into the Boston airport wearing my ten-month-old son in a baby carrier and balancing a 55 pound anxious dog in an oversized crate on an unthinkably tiny luggage carrier (oh, Logan!) while my three-year-old clung to my thigh things were looking bleak. We were running late and I wanted to check in the dog while my husband dealt with the rest of the luggage, the rental, and a looming police officer. I was frazzled, but the Alaska Air staff spotted me right away and from then on our travel experience went smoothly. He really made sure that all the documents are checked as quick as possible and helped me take the dog crate through inspection. No one gave me any trouble with the dog, and we received a ticked assuring us that she was on the plane with us in the cargo. We found her safe and sound at our destination. All the while the staff member was entertaining and patient with my curious and slightly anxious daughter and assured me that he will take care that my husband gets on the plane in time as he was late returning the rental car, which he did. Everyone else working with Alaska Air was very courteous and attentive as well. Since we booked our seats late, we were not assigned to the same row, and with two small children this six hour flight could have turned very ugly if we were kept apart. The flight attendants took care of this issue right away and adjusted our seating so that we were in the same row (also thanks to two gracious gentlemen who agreed to switch their seats for us). The flight was long but comfortable, there was enough leg room even in the economy seats with snacks, drinks, and entertainment tablets making the long flight with tired kids tolerable. By the way the food was hot and delicious. Another nice touch came when we requested an entertainment tablet which was ten dollars per piece. The flight attendant noticed that my husband gave it to our daughter right away, so she gave him another one at no extra charge. No one harassed us when our kids were getting loud and impatient (which happened couple of times and ended very quickly, they are such good kids), and no one mentioned anything to me as I was nursing my little boy for most of the flight. I only have great things to say about the Alaska crew, they were so professional and compassionate. I know I would recommend this airline to any family.

### "extremely friendly and helpful"
After flying around the USA for the past month on numerous different airlines, I experienced no better inflight service than with Alaskan Airlines. From the moment I arrived at the gate to board and the plane trip itself their staff and cabin service was exceptional. They were extremely friendly and helpful making sure everyone was comfortable, happy and had everything they needed and wanted. I wish I had flown with Alaskan Airlines more on this trip.

### "crew professional, clean planes, good food"
Just returned from a quick five day jaunt to Eugene, OR, flying Alaska Airlines. Bumped up to First class both ways due to my Gold status and some luck as well. The flights were great, crews professional, clean planes, good food and on time both directions. I had the pleasure of sitting next to a WWII former fighter pilot whose son is a Captain with Alaska. He was quite a hit with the crew as he seemed to be well known. I enjoyed his company and he made the flight an unforgettable experience. Departing in a week or so to fly to Raleigh NC on the first ever Alaska Airlines flight to grace the Tarheel State.

### "I recommended flying Alaska Airlines"
Alaska Airlines staff has excellent customer service and are willing to help any way they can. They make flying easy. I flew to Mexico for my wedding and they gave us free drinks and food and a seat in first class. They accommodated my dress that I carried on the plane and made my stressful trip that less hectic. I recommended flying Alaska Airlines for any trip.

### "don't really care about you attitude"
There have been numerous incidents with Alaska Airlines while my daughter has lived in Mammoth Lakes over the past 5 years. Today, Sept 15, 2015 my daughter, who had made her reservation weeks ago to fly down and go on vacation to a central coast beach town, got a text at 1 pm today notifying her that her flight had been cancelled. The next flight is tomorrow evening which would have her arriving at 7ish and we are due to be at our vacation destination tomorrow. If she took the offer for tomorrow we would be losing one nights hotel stay nonrefundable as there is a 48 hour deadline to cancel. She called Alaska Airlines to get her refund as now she has to drive down to LA by herself in order to make our plan work. She asked why the flight was cancelled, already knowing what they would say. Alaska Airlines go to phrase for cancelling flights is "mechanical problems" when the flight isn't full enough. Sure enough that is what she was told. I'm thinking really, there are 3 hours before the flight leaves LAX for Mammoth and there isn't a working plane available to be brought in? Well, of course there is nothing a passenger can do or say to change the "I don't really care about you" attitude that exists in this situation. It is really sad that this happens fairly often which proves to me that Alaska Airlines really doesn't care about this particular flight. I feel Alaska Airlines should perhaps not be flying in to Mammoth Lakes every day. If people knew there was a limited schedule at least they would know how to plan instead of last minute cancellations being frequent.

### "the worst travel experience by far"
This Alaskan Airlines trip has been the worst travel experience by far. I was stuck at the airport for 9 hours because they kept pushing the flight back every hour until they finally canceled it and reconnected me through a Delta Air Lines flight that was 3 hours later. Had to spend the night in San Diego and the next day I was optimistic that I would get to my final destination without a problem but of course the second I got there they flight was delayed due to mechanical issues. Very annoying and took up a lot of my vacation time.

### "the crew were wonderful"
Two more great flights with Alaska Airlines. Vancouver to Seattle was fine, no service due to weather but the Seattle to Kona flight was really good. It was packed full, but the crew were wonderful. Friendly, professional and fun - what more could you ask for? The crew get you in the mood for the Islands! We left on time and arrived a bit early.

### "friendly, courteous, and professional"
Alaska Airlines is the best, they provide complimentary drinks, including beer and wine. Service is offered a couple of times even on a short 1.5 hour flight. The flight attendants are friendly, courteous, and professional.

### "live and learn"
Usually I am more than pleased with my trips on Alaska Airlines. I am a Gold member and will be again for this next year. The trip from Atlanta to Seattle was delayed due to a mechanical issue, starboard engine. This was fixed and we were about two hours late departing ATL. We were rebooked in ATL prior to finally leaving. This delay caused me to miss Flight 119 from SEA to ANC. I was rebooked on Flight 121 which is a Combi 400 737. Arrived at almost 3am and my luggage did not. None of the Atlanta folks luggage made it to ANC. I spoke with the luggage person and she said it would be sent out later on in the morning. I accepted this, not happy but it does happen. I called the MVP Gold customer service folks today to inquire about a partial refund for my flight as it had no 1st Class. She spoke to the accounting department and said I will get an $80 credit. The bottom line here is a customer who was not pleased overall, especially in regards to finding out about travel segments, some being refundable and some not. Oh well, live and learn. Portions of my experience went very well. Some others, not so much. I have four more trips coming up by Christmas on Alaska. I hope they go better than this one.

### Alaska Airlines customer review
Alaska has always done a good job when I have flown with them but this time was even better than normal. There was a mix up with my ticket and I learned at the gate that I would not have the First Class seat that I thought I had. The gate agent did get me an Exit Row seat and refunded the fare difference. The agent, emailed me the refund information by the time I had arrived in SEA. The cabin crew always does a great job and so much better service than other airlines provide. I wish Alaska flew to more destinations.

### Alaska Airlines customer review
It was the worst service. I bought three seats (30 D/E/F) in a row from Seattle to Salt lake. I wasn't able to fill the third seat which was nonrefundable. After boarding I was relaxing in my aisle seat of the three seat I bought and paid for. A man came and wanted my seat, which I refused because I had paid for all three seats. A flight attendant and ticket taker lady showed up and she belligerently told me to give up my seat and told me to move to my middle seat. She didn't offer a refund or any compensation for the seat that they basically outright stole and resold one of my seat from me. Since I didn't want to make a scene, I comply in protest and moved. She was very unprofessional, insensitive and rude.

### Alaska Airlines customer review
This was the first time I have flown with this airline and I was very disappointed. Both flights of my round trip were delayed a minimum of 2 hours. After spending more money to save time instead of driving, I ended up spending way more time sitting in an airport. I will not fly this airline again if I can help it.

### Alaska Airlines customer review
First time flying with Alaska Airlines, we usually fly Southwest but they don't offer non-stop flights from Albuquerque to Seattle any more. Got a great deal on flights for 3 people, was able to do everything over the internet. Paid luggage fees, checked in online, printed luggage tickets, and boarding passes. When we arrived at the ticket counter at the airport in Albuquerque, we found out that it didn't open until an hour or so later. Surprisingly, two Alaska Airlines employees came out and helped us with our luggage tags since they use a special holder to attach to the luggage. As we were about to start boarding another employee approached us and asked if we would like to board using a new system that they were starting to use. He scanned our boarding passes and we were all set. The flight was great, all of the attendants were very courteous and helpful. Our return flight was also great and without any problems.

### Alaska Airlines customer review
I had a fantastic customer service experience with Alaska Airlines thanks to one member of staff! She showed genuine concern, empathy, and common courtesy in regards to my plight due to a problem with Delta Air Lines. It wasn't her obligation to help me, but she did so willingly and with kindness. She offered suggestions, took the time to research, and above all else, took the time to show she cared. Her actions represented her airline in the best way possible because when the day is done, having a person show care is what we remember the most.

### Alaska Airlines customer review
Another series of fine flights with Alaska. Redeye to Seattle with a fine crew. Service was good. Plane was clean and on time. We had one unusual thing happen - a person apparently acted out in some manner towards a crew member right after we pulled back from the gate. We then returned to the gate and this "gentleman" was escorted off our plane. After that excitement we were off with no further issues. Upon landing at SeaTac I made my way eventually to the Boardroom where I enjoyed coffee and rolls, caught up on news and relaxed. The flight to ATL went fine. Again, plane was clean, crew was great and appeared quite professional in all regards. The return leg went fine. The pilot on the outbound leg to Seattle informed us of some possible rough air coming up over the St Louis area which folks appreciated. The food I ate was decent and the wine was enjoyable as well. The final leg back up to Anchorage was without any negatives. I actually caught some sleep which for me is unusual. Landed a few minutes early, luggage made it on time and then home to the Valley. All in all, a fine series of flights with great.

### Alaska Airlines customer review
Pleasant Flight, great staff, always try to fly with Alaska when I can, however I was not impressed with the food product. The first class service was great, but the food was not so good.

### Alaska Airlines customer review
Checked into Alaska Airlines at the Santa Rosa airport 2 hours before take off. The plane was 30 minutes late. Because they were late they decided to rush boarding and instead of the allotted 30 minutes it was more like 10-15 minutes. My 70 year mom and dad were right behind us in security. My husband and I got through security and we were rushed to get on the plane. I told them there were 2 more behind us. They decided to just cut the line there and didn't let them board! To top it off I was worried about my 70 year old mom (she was upset and crying) so I asked the flight attendant about my mom and dad not being on the plane. She snapped at me that it was too bad, and that they probably weren't there on time. I responded that we checked into the airport 2 hours previously. She said rudely, 'so?'. My mom ended up having to fly out of her way north to Seattle and them back down to San Diego to make it in time. Horrible airline, insensitive staff, rude, and couldn't care less about their customers and how they treat then.

### Alaska Airlines customer review
Short one and half hour flight, seats were comfortable, very friendly staff from check in until we disembarked and we were given a free snack and drinks.

### Alaska Airlines customer review
Flew down to Louisville from Anchorage with a stop at ORD on the way. Bumped up to First again which was nice. Crew was great, plane clean and on time. I found nothing to complain about and arrived relaxed and pleased with the service. O'Hare airport in Chicago was a zoo. It was as crowded and noisy as Atlanta always seems to be. I went to the American Admirals Club and mellowed out for a few hours - fine service there and the views of the aircraft was a plus. Flight to SDF on American Eagle was fine - the E-175 they use was quite a nice aircraft for this short trip, great views from the large windows on board. The return trip back to ANC began again at SDF to ORD, same plane as above, fine service, nice crew etc. I was routed to Portland from Chicago this time. All went well, I was seated in economy and had no complaints. I purchased the movie viewer and was well entertained. Great service too. The flight to ANC was near perfect. Only problem encountered was that our luggage was about thirty five minutes late getting to us. I put in and received my 2500 free air miles for that issue. All in all, flights were fine, crews were great and on time for all sectors. I feel Alaska should move up to a 4 Star rating.

### Alaska Airlines customer review
One way, PDX-LAX. Everything was smooth sailing. Seats were comfortable, staff were great, and the flight was on time. I also like the electrical outlets in the seats. The big disappointment was the food. Nothing substantial on this flight except cookies and a small bag of pretzels. They made such a big deal about their cookies. I would have preferred an option such as fruit or cheese and crackers. I don't really know what they are thinking with this. I would have given them a 10 if not for the snack issue.

### Alaska Airlines customer review
LAX-SEA on the 737-800. Flew on 4th of July and the atmosphere on-board was festive and friendly. Flight attendants interacted with the passengers. Purser was lovely. The crew was probably one of the best and most friendly I have flown with. They went above and beyond when I realized I had left my jacket at the lounge and made sure I got it back. Seats comfortable with plenty of space for the 2-hour flight. Food and beverage selection was extensive. Excellent snack of pasta with marinara sauce, beans, along with with a salad which was fresh. Overall, a wonderful flight. Good lounge, excellent service, great food and comfortable seats.

### Alaska Airlines customer review
Just returned to the Greatland having flown what is now my favorite airline once again. Departed ANC at 5 am and arrived ontime in SEA. I was bumped up to First due to my Gold status which I appreciate. The service was fine, the plane clean and all in all nothing to complain about. The trip to Redmond was on Horizon, a Q-400. No problems with anything here. If there was one thing though it would be the seats on the Q do not adjust at all. I wish they would but understand why they don't. The return trip was great on both legs. The crew was very impressive with their customer service.

### Alaska Airlines customer review
Returned recently from a trip to SEA from ANC and SDF (on Am Eagle) to ORD then onto ANC. All flights were well run affairs with fine crews and great service. I flew First and when I get upgraded I always enjoy the experience. I am however more than pleased when I do not move up as the rest of the plane service crew does a fine job. I have yet to be unhappy with this airline since I have returned to using it on all my flights out and back to the Greatland. I have about six more flights scheduled in the next half year and I plan to fly them every time. Please keep it up!

### Alaska Airlines customer review
Flight 893 9 May. I don't fly Alaska at all as my loyalties are with another airline at present because of frequent flier status. I flew last Saturday night at 9.45pm from Seattle to Oakland. What a difference in customer service. From the very start in the airport - their employees seemed gracious. The agents at the departure gate seemed relaxed and most affable as I watched them before our boarding call. My mainline carrier I usually fly - the employees always seem "put out" when they are interrupted from their computers. Inflight was pleasant. Flight attendants who seemed happy. If Alaska Airlines flew where I needed to go - they would have won me over.

### Alaska Airlines customer review
Flight AS838 on 6 May. Flew Alaska from Honolulu to Oakland on 6 May. I was not expecting much for the cost of the first class ticket and was pleasantly surprised. Aircraft was not old (737-800) seat was spacious enough for a 5 hour day time flight. Meal was good and a nice linen service. Even the wine served was quite good and topped up regularly if you wished without having to ask. Crew were friendly and efficient. Even check in was quick and efficient. Overall a good experience and I think worth the extra for first class for this length flight. I rate it as highly as some domestic Australian business class flights I've had so it was quite good.

### Alaska Airlines customer review
Upgraded to first class for our flight from SEA to DFW. Had seen Tom Douglas in the news lately talking his about the new menu he created for all Alaska flights. Our breakfast going down and dinner coming back was awful looking awful smelling and awful tasting. Many in 1st class that had the dinner on the return did not eat it. Even FA said she was embarrassed to be serving this meal. The spinach had a nasty smell to it.

### Alaska Airlines customer review
Flew with family SJC-Honolulu then returned to SJC via Seattle. Economy Class. All planes were 737's of some variety. The seats were comfortable with adjustable headrests but legroom was terrible. I'm short so this was only a problem when I (or someone else) wanted to use the restroom as the person on the aisle seat had no choice but to get out of his seat to accommodate us. The cheese platter is an excellent meal available on all flights. Availability of hot meals was inconsistent and confusing (available one direction but not the other on flights before 9 am or after etc.). Flight attendants were friendly and attentive. However on our trip from HNL-SEA they disappeared 3 hours into the 5.5 hour flight and we were getting thirsty. Had to go ask for water. Hint: Alaska boards very early (45 min) and will depart early if they can. We once showed up 20 minutes before our departure time with boarding passes I had printed the night before and the plane had left already! They said they had paged us but we couldn't hear anything in that particular airport. Fortunately they had seats available on the next flight 2 hours later and got us on that for no charge.

### Alaska Airlines customer review
Flew First LA to Pueto Vallarta and had several issues. Firstly leg room was the poorest I'd experienced in first class ever. Secondly the cabin was far too cold and no rugs are supplied. Thirdly several passengers were allowed to remain in a reclined seat position for landing a safety issue. Lunch offered no choice - the chicken wedge salad was inedible. Luggage took well over the 20 minutes to arrive on the carousel. I could go on but let's just say I won't be flying with them again.

### Alaska Airlines customer review
Kona - Oakland First class. What an improvement. Leaving United in the dust Alaska offers good food good service and decent leg room on this sector. Individual meals instead of all at one time distinguish this excellent offering from United using the same aircraft and only one hard working flight attendant. Finally a major carrier steps up and offers good service to and from Hawaii.

### Alaska Airlines customer review
Great service Seattle to Kona. Major upgrade in meal entertainment and attitude since last years trip. Keep it up Alaska you won me over.

### Alaska Airlines customer review
I recently flew first class from Cancun Mexico to Seattle Washington. Having tried many times to upgrade and not having any luck I was excited that I finally got the chance. My boyfriend and I each used 10000 points to splurge on the trip home. I would never have done so if I knew how poor the service would be. Our steward was beyond rude. He offered no service whatsoever was totally unhelpful with any questions and hung out in the front away from the passengers. We had to ask for more water let alone a drink and when we did his attitude was atrocious. I realize first class isn't what it used to be but had I known what this would have been like I would have saved my points and stayed in coach I've had much better service there! Very disappointing for my first time going "first class".

### Alaska Airlines customer review
I had never flown Alaska before this past 2014-15 Christmas/New Year season. My fiancé had relocated for work to Portland OR from Massachusetts. We had two cats to move and decided it would be best for them to fly with me in the cabin for the holiday. The operator who booked the flights with my fiancé was so helpful and made sure we had all the information we needed to get the cats ready. When I got to Logan Airport in Boston I was allowed to board early with the cat carriers. When one of my cats started getting antsy in her carrier and I had the carrier in my lap the stewardesses asked if the kitties needed anything. There was no fuss or problems traveling with the cats. Check in was smooth and easy on both going and coming. The Alaska Airlines staff is genuinely friendly and pleasant which is such a change from the canned fake concern most airlines staff seem to have. The mileage club is so easy to use and keep track of miles. It is nice to see that customer service is still a virtue in some companies.

### Alaska Airlines customer review
Yesterday January 19 2015 I flew Flight 16 from Seattle back to Orlando. It had been a round-about 48 hour visit to an ill relative and I was exhausted from having to rise in the wee hours AM to board coming and going on the only non-stop flight. It has been many years since I have seen flight attendants so "up-beat" and kind with a sense of humor in the face of a fully packed jumbo jet. And too many years since I have seen well-groomed stewardesses actively caring for each passenger. Accolades to Alaska Airlines for returning to a more gracious time during these chaotic ones.

### Alaska Airlines customer review
Travelled from Philadelphia to Maui via Seattle. Flew first class. After take off flight attendant stated that there were only 16 first class meals on board for the 16 first class seats. There were two choices of menu 8 each. She started taking orders at the front of the first class section and I was setting in the back when she got to me there were no choices left take the remaining selection or nothing. So I end up with nothing. She came back and offered me a cheese platter with 7 grapes and two so so cheeses and some crackers. Seats were standard first class seats which did not come close to lay flat. Hand held entertainment device did not work. Poor excuse for a first class flight.

### Alaska Airlines customer review
Returned early this morning from my flight Redmond to Seattle to Anchorage on Alaska in First. (upgraded). This flight was fine once we got into the air. Our plane had an issue or two which prevented an on time takeoff. We were about 70 minutes delayed but the crew did a fine job keeping everyone informed and did their usual fine job for the passengers. Paul was our employee in first and did an outstanding job great humor and fantastic work ethic. Even though we were late getting home to the Greatland nobody on board (from what I saw) griped about it. We were just glad to be back home.

### Alaska Airlines customer review
Flew LAX-SEA-BLI on B737-900. Took the offer of a first class upgrade for $50. Friendly attentive crew and a meal was served. I always find Alaska good value for the money. The only drawback is the constant PA's telling you how to do everything from how to stow your bag in the overhead to not using the call bell unless it's a medical emergency. All in all though a safe comfortable and reasonably priced service.

### Alaska Airlines customer review
SEA to IAH return. First time flying on Alaska. Both legs were on time. Service was friendly. I appreciate the communication from the pilot or first officer with respect to turbulence and what's happening with the flight. Leg room was decent for economy class. Not a big fan of their food and beverage selections. Being a bit of a nervous flyer I generally tend to ask for 3 glasses of red wine when drink service is offered so I can slip slowly and make them last for a 4 hour flight and mellow out. One Flight Attendant took exception to me ordering 3 glasses (apparently fearing I was going to become intoxicated on the flight). In addition the wine service is poured from a bottle into a plastic cafeteria cup. Other airlines simply give you a little bottle which you pour yourself (which I much prefer). So this aspect was about the only thing that I give a thumbs down to. Another thing I like about some other airlines you have your own IFE system display. For me it's a matter of simply selecting "My Flight" as I like to see the progress of the flight. Not possible with Alaska.

### Alaska Airlines customer review
Flew BLI-SEA-SNA. Bellingham to Seattle on Horizon Q400. No service offered on this sector. Comfortable flight. Only 45 minute connection time in Seattle however made it to the next gate with ease. Boarded the B737-700 from the tarmac in the cold pouring Seattle rain instead of via an airbridge. Crew were efficient but no smiles or interactions with the passengers. Legroom excellent for economy and seat very comfortable. Really convenient being able to fly into John Wayne airport. I fly with Alaska fairly often and always find their service comfortable reliable and good value for the money.

### Alaska Airlines customer review
Left Santa Ana late because plane arrived late. Had connection in Portland and we only had now 5 minutes to get from gate C to lower level gate A. Dozen or so people running to their gates. Luckily for us there were several flyers going to Eugene so the flight was held and even waited for luggage. Thank you Alaska Airlines for making the end of our vacation a happy ending.

### Alaska Airlines customer review
SEA-IAH first class 739 equipment. Boarding was fine and efficient. Left about ten minutes late due to catering not being available until last minute. Hit cruise 19 minutes into flight but it was fully an hour before FA served drinks. Nothing unusual going on so this was inexplicable. Service was friendly but very slow.

### Alaska Airlines customer review
Recently traveled for the first time on an Alaska Airlines flight from San Diego-Boston. It was the best domestic flight I have experienced. The 4 cabin crew members were excellent and very customer engaged with passengers needs. The flight wasn't full and they came to me and asked if I wanted a row of seats to myself to relax for the duration of the flight. The service was great 3 rounds of snack and beverage service for the 5-hour flight. The aircraft was a Boeing 737-800 and the legroom was great. A job well done. I look forward to flying onboard in the near future. The only downfall to Alaska Airlines is they charge $10.00 for a video recorder to watch the movies. There should be no charge for that as it should be complimentary since snacks sandwiches and alcohol are charged to the customer.

### Alaska Airlines customer review
12/1/14 ORD-SEA Flt 29. Arrived at the airport about 1.5 hours early. Only 1 agent at the counter. Waited about 15 mins before another agent appeared to assist. Once there it went smoothly and quickly. Boarding was efficient and able to be seated quickly. We were issued their digiplayers. Fair selection of movies to view but really no place to put the player when the meal arrived. A bit cumbersome. Meal offered was one choice only. It was tasty but portions have certainly been scaled back. Flight attendant disappeared after the meal service. Arrived on time. However I remember Alaska having a far superior service to that of its rivals but this flight did not prove that at all.

### Alaska Airlines customer review
12/4/14 SEA to ORD Flt 22. When checking in one has to perform a self bag tag and then take the luggage to the check in desk. There were 2 of us - we had 1 bag to check. It was over by 4lbs but since you are allowed two pieces of luggage per person we were well with in the weight limit. Too bad cost $75. Flight departed on time. Staff were friendly service was standard. Same meal offered on both segments but yet again nothing remarkable that would make me select this carrier over the competition. Once meal was served and one refresher of drinks the FA disappeared. I was disappointed with the overall service. It is not what I was accustomed to. A digiplayer for the entertainment was handed out but it is cumbersome to have on your tray table when the meal is served.

### Alaska Airlines customer review
SEA-LAX. Standard seating food etc for a 2.5 hour flight. As first class has an advantage over others in that you get access to their airline club even if you are flying just domestic and not connecting to an international flight (and aren't a club member). Alaska has both refundable and non-refundable first class fares. Non-refundable is about 1/2 the cost of the refundable but is not available on all routes (e.g. we were going to fly to BUR but only fc fare was refundable so we chose to fly to LAX instead).

Flew one of the Alaska/Horizon regional routes PDX-MFR night flight. The flight was originally at 9.05-ish but was delayed to 9.55. Got info 3 hours ahead of time and we still boarded late because traffic on the taxiway. Once aboard seats were fairly comfy flight attendants were friendly easily accommodated my sister's severe nut allergy made sure no nut-containing items were aboard the plane (standard airline safety procedure) and served two drinks for a flight less than an hour. Not bad Alaska.

### Alaska Airlines customer review
10-12-14 early flight SMF to SEA. Seats were thin but comfortable legroom seemed a bit more generous than the space I'm used to on other carriers seats had power outlets. I flew Alaska as part of a Delta flight from SMF- SEA-DTW-TVC the ticket purchased with my spouse's frequent flyer miles. I would choose to fly Alaska again over another airline even if the ticket price was higher. The aircraft didn't have entertainment. The food selection looked decent although I didn't buy any.

### Alaska Airlines customer review
Flew Alaska MCI to SEA return in First. Both legs were pleasant but the service on the outbound leg got off to a slow start with no pre-take off beverage offered. However once we were in the air the flight attendant was very quick to begin beverage service. Seats were comfortable but the pitch was a little tight I wish Alaska would invest in some bigger planes for their longer cross country flights in order to have a larger First Class cabin. Food was very good served plated and fresh. Check In both in Kansas City and Seattle was extremely easy and the Board Room in Seattle was pleasant. For a full fare ticket it wasn't an overall bad experience but felt that I overpaid slightly for what I got. Will fly Alaska First again in December and am looking forward to gaining elite status with them. Their mileage earning partnerships cannot be beat and I love that I can fly Delta American British Airways and Emirates as needed and still earn miles.

Flew from SFO to ANC to SFO with stopover in SEA on 5th and 13th September 2014. These were routine flights. There were no delays in fact each leg was a few minutes ahead of schedule and baggage came out in the first few minutes. The Champagne and Beer was cold the food was really just snacks as we travelled in between normal mealtimes. This was good value as we were allowed 2 pieces of luggage each. I would definitely recommend this airline.

### Alaska Airlines customer review
My wife and I travelled to SEA and return to ANC recently on Alaska. No issues at all problem wise. Both flights were fine crews were great lanes clean on time arrivals etc. I tried to upgrade to First as I am a MVP Gold member but alas no luck. Maybe next time. I told my spouse it is a nice experience and she was hoping to see it firsthand. Anyhow keep up the good work and thanks Alaska.

Took Alaska to Cabo on Sept 15th Alaska stated flight is still going. Get to San Diego Cabo flight still going. 30 minutes later our flight is cancelled. Alaska says no seats open back to Seattle tough luck. Find out the Cabo airport was shut down the day before and Alaska flew us to San Diego knowing this.

I had a flight scheduled from ATL-SEA and the day of it was cancelled. So just four hours before my flight I was scrambling to get another flight that day.. Not only that but they didn't even send an alert that the flight was cancelled. My google alerts notified me about the cancellation. The customer service is non-existent and I will never book with them again. Book at your own risk!

### Alaska Airlines customer review
Returned last week from a ANC-SEA-ATL and return in First. No complaints with the flights at all. As usual (for me) the service was outstanding the planes clean and the flight crews were very friendly. We were told we would be departing ATL about an hour late due to a crew rest issue. This would cause me to miss my connection to ANC in Seattle. I was rebooked quickly by the ATL folks. I caught my flight with minutes to spare in SEA but of course my bag did not show until the next flight. The Alaska employee at baggage claim was tired and a bit grumpy but I was given a coupon for 2500 miles and that was fine with me. Besides this issue all was great. Looking forward to our next flight to SEA this Thursday evening.

### Alaska Airlines customer review
Alaska is our airline of choice. MCI-SEA-ANC flights generally good and on time. New Sky interior slimline Recaro seats (a bit uncomfortable). On landing at Anchorage the pilot apparently took a wrong taxiway or misjudged the turn as he braked to a halt (squeal on the brakes hard stop) then used reverse thrusters to turn the plane completely around. ANC-SEA-MCI late flight out of ANC substituted a smaller plane which put us in a non-recline seat. All in all we have been satisfied with Alaska and will continue to use them as these are somewhat minor issues and tend to be found on all airlines.

We have just arrived back in New Zealand after our Alaskan cruise and would like to commend Alaska Airlines customer service desk for their excellent and sympathetic response to out late arrival due to tardy shuttle service resulting in our late arrival at LAX airport. We were very stressed as were to travel to Seattle the staff member advised that although our flight hadn't quite left it was indeed too late to get on but immediately advised that they had a flight every hour and could get us on the next flight. After all this there was no extra charges for this change we were so impressed with that.

I flew Alaska non-stop from Dallas to Portland first class. The crew were very friendly and attentive to everyone's needs. We had an hour delay after boarding the aircraft in Dallas but the crew kept everybody informed and kept serving drinks and a small snack for us. Very impressed with their first class service.

Recently flew on Alaska Airlines with my 2 longer legs (TUS to SEA and ANC to PDX) in First Class. On these flights (along with the other 2 segments) the flight and flight crew were fine. My complaint is with what defines "First Class" to Alaska Airlines. On TUS-SEA our meal consisted of a chicken sandwich and a chocolate mint! No inflight entertainment devices provided. On the ANC-PDX segment (which was 2.45 Alaska time to 7am PDX time). No wake-up breakfast which meant zero food provided at all. Flight attendant asked if we wanted anything as we were already in the process of pre-landing operations. And since an overnight flight no inflight entertainment. Guess I'm expecting too much for paying for a first class seat.

Flying from Soldotna AK we were fogged in. In only takes a short while for fog to burn off but they delayed the flight twice and then canceled it. I had the option to either have a 12 hour layover in Anchorage or spend the night in Seattle's airport. After waiting 3 hours I was flown to Anchorage. I had 100lbs of frozen fish I worked hard catching. Alaska air refused to help in any way. No mailing my fish home no putting it in a freezer. They refused to put me in a hotel to sleep no options whatsoever. I called them and the woman told me "We can't pick up the tab for every act of God" and "this happens all the time. Once in Anchorage I tried to switch to the flight where I stay overnight in Seattle because someone I knew had a freezer and I could stay there. Customer service said 1 seat was left while asking her supervisor permission the seat was taken. I took the next flight 4 hours later only to find out the freezer was unavailable so late at night. So I was sent by customer service to get my fish from baggage (it was checked) then come back. I did and asked again to change to the plan to layover 12 hours in Anchorage. I went and waited in line again. I got my fish into the freezer in Anchorage for 28$ not bad but I shouldn't have to pay for that. 3 hours in Soldotna 12 hours in Anchorage a red-eye flight to Seattle then another 3 hour lay-over until my next flight home which is only a 2.5 hour drive. I was so exhausted. I can't believe this happens all the time and everyone lets them get away with this.

### Alaska Airlines customer review
My first flight from Vancouver to Seattle was great - the crew were fantastic. However my flight from Seattle to Salt Lake City was not very enjoyable. I found the crew to be lazy and rude. I tried to order a beverage on the plane and they had closed out early (1 hour early) and right after they had passed with the drink cart. I've flown before and unless there is turbulence then typically a plane will serve you until about 30 minutes before landing. One flight attendant was very rude. I usually love flying Alaska and was about to apply for my Alaska Air credit card but this was very disappointing. I think I may hold back on applying because of this particular experience.

### Alaska Airlines customer review
This week on my trip to Seattle I flew Alaska Airlines when in the past I would normally fly United. Alaska Airlines far exceeded my expectations. If I could use them to fly everywhere I would. The flight attendants actually seemed happy and were very nice. The seats were extremely comfortable - much more comfortable than other flights that I've been on. The plane was clean. I will definitely fly with Alaska Airlines anytime I can.

We flew from Maui to Seattle with a connection in Seattle to Washington D.C. First the plane leaving Maui was delayed for over 3 hours. Alaska Airlines took us off our connecting flight without telling us (Seattle to D.C.) and booked us on a much later flight. Thank goodness I checked before departing from Maui. I was told that they didn't think there would be enough time to make the connection. I asked for them to get me on another flight/airline where I wasn't waiting for my connection for five or more hours. They couldn't do this I was told. I demanded to be put back on the earlier connection and told them I would attempt to make the connection although I had less than 30 minutes to do so. I was told that my seats were already taken by someone else. I informed them that tickets had been given to me already for my seats and they had better get me back on that plane. After some time they did get me back onto the connecting flight from Seattle to D.C. The plane from Maui to Seattle took off several hours late and it did not have very good air conditioning. The plane was hot poor service and I was not impressed at all with Alaska Airlines. I will never fly with them again. The connecting flight from Seattle to D.C. was also very hot on the plane. Don't fly Alaska Airways. Go with another carrier such as United Delta or American Airlines.

Flight was supposed to depart at 1.30pm from Seattle to Long Beach but it didn't. For the first hour the flight was delayed because one of the aircraft crew was late” Then we were told the flight was delayed for another 3 hours. I could not wait any longer. I requested to be put on another available flight to California. I was placed on flight # 464Y Seattle to Los Angeles with departure time at 7.25 pm. I wasted 6 hours of my time and I had to pay an extra fee to rent a car from LAX area and pay with higher rate. I arrived in a hotel at 11.30 pm. The trip to Long Beach took me 12 hours instead of 5 hours. I would be OK with this if the flight back to Seattle had not been canceled too. Flight 3477 from Long Beach to Seattle with departure time at 7.25 pm was canceled because of some engine problems. At 11.00 pm I was told that the aircraft would not be fixed any soon and all hotels around Long Beach and LAX were booked. I had to take a taxi to LAX and had to sleep on the bench in LAX airport so I could finally fly to Seattle on the 6am flight. It was the worst experience in flight and I am flying for business a lot.

### Alaska Airlines customer review
Flew LAX to DCA. Delay leaving LAX due to air traffic congestion but was kept informed. The seats were pretty uncomfortable considering this was a 5+ hours flight. I was very glad that I purchased a 'comfort seat' alongside as I was coming off a 15 hour flight from Australia and had space to spread out. The cabin crew were lovely and most helpful. We had a strange delay in DCA as we arrived 2 hours late due to earlier delay and adverse weather around DC and the Alaska gate was taken by another Alaska plane and we ended up waiting around 30 minutes on the tarmac for space to be found. Would use them again but would definitely purchase the comfort seat for added space.

We traveled home from Las Vegas on Tuesday July 29. Our plane was 4.5 hours late and I cannot say enough how great the Alaska Airline staff were . They were very helpful apologetic and kept us informed the entire time on what the updates were on our flight and when we could expect to take off. We really appreciated the positive attitude and genuine care of their employees. It made the inconvenience of having to wait for our flight much easier and very helpful.

Just returned from my trip south ANC-SEA-EUG and returned EUG-PDX-ANC. All flights were fine the crews were all professional clean aircraft on time and the food was quite decent. We had quite a few young children flying back to Alaska with their parents from 3 months of age up to five in my section. The flight attendants were very helpful and appeared to enjoy the interaction with the little ones. I flew the 400 model combi south for the first time. Not bad at all for a red eye flight. All in all a fine experience.

July 24th. Flew SLC-SFO in the morning and returned the same evening. Best short haul domestic experience this year. Boarding handled smoothly. Flight crew extremely polite and courteous.

Flew from Los Angeles to Anchorage on Alaska 149. The flight left and arrived in destination on time. The purchase food quality and quantity were OK. The drinks provided during the flight are more than adequate. The service was nice.

### Alaska Airlines customer review
Plane delayed due to mechanical trouble. So they re-routed another flight and changed the direction of the flight and the stops although still ending up in Seattle where we were headed. So instead of leaving around 11am we left more like at 4pm. At our first stop in Wrangel some people got on. Then some more. Then a few more. After a while the crew started counting passengers. Then did it again. And again. Then they started asking names as well as counting. Then did that again. And again. And again. As far as I could tell they never found any trouble and never made anyone leave the plane. Then they said we were overweight and had to unload some fuel. After that they started counting and naming again. When I asked if they be serving dinner since it was now after 4 and we wouldn't get to Seattle until after at least 9 pm they said they had 4 wraps on board to sell. The CSA then came on the plane and yelled at me for delaying the plane! For asking if we'd get fed! More than an hour after that harangue we left. We arrived in Seattle around 1 am hungry.

### Alaska Airlines customer review
ANC to SLC return in First both directions. I have no complaints whatsoever. The food was fine the service was excellent on-time both directions and the plane was clean. Their SLC growth (# of flights to and from there) has not affected their great customer service negatively as far as I could tell. One thing which was different on the return flight though was that the flight attendant came around prior to our landing and thanked each customer for flying with Alaska and I felt she meant it. It was a small but very classy thing to do as I have never seen this before. It is the small but kind gestures that help make a difference when I fly. Keep it up Alaska!

### Alaska Airlines customer review
In May I flew with the airline three times: San Francisco to Seattle at the start of my visit then a return flight at the end. In between I flew from Palm Springs to Seattle with the airline. All were good and timely. My main comments are words of praise for the check-in team at Seattle at the start of my return flight when they worked long and diligently to ensure my luggage in the hold was correctly tagged directly back to my home airport in Perth Australia for that 21-hour flight via Hong Kong.

### Alaska Airlines customer review
I flew from Seattle to Anchorage on a 737-800 with the new slimline Recaro seats. Each seat had a power outlet with a USB port and the seats were very comfy with an adjustable head rest and more legroom compared to the old seats. I noticed that there was no longer a barrier between first class and coach but maybe they will install it later. I had 30 minutes of free Wi-Fi thanks to a partnership with Allstate. I tested the speed at 2 Mb/sec download and 0.25 Mb/sec upload. I rented an entertainment player for $8 and had time to watch a movie along with a few other clips. The devices are a little slow and touchy but are still functional. Soon Alaska Airlines will offer entertainment on your own iPads laptops etc. I purchased the chicken dinner for $6 which consisted of boneless chicken breast mashed potatoes and green beans and actually tasted very good. The drink cart went around 2 times during the 3 hour flight and the second time I had delicious orange Tazo tea. Overall a great experience with great service all around!

Looking forward to the Alaskan Experience once again.

Just back from a trip from ANC to Portland then SMF and return. We departed about 40 minutes late from ANC due to a switch issue but made up for it enroute. We had a medical emergency also but the passenger was given oxygen and was well cared for by the crew. Horizon provided the flight south to Sacramento and that was fine in all regards. The trip back was nearly perfect. My only issue is the waiting room in Portland it is a zoo! Otherwise - great!

Flew SEA to SAN in April. Absolutely flawless. Check in was simple and hassle free. Once onboard all cabin crew were so pleasant. Repeated drinks service throughout the flight. One passenger taken ill the crew were reaching out for doctors onboard and they also stood by. Plenty of legroom in economy. Aircraft 737-800 seemed brand new. Interior was clean and fresh. Baggage was on the belt in no time despite it was a short walk from the gate to the belt. Absolutely on top of my choice among American carriers.

I flew Palm Springs to Portland. We departed Palm Springs 5.5 hours late due to a wind/dust storm. The crew were fantastic. We were on and off the plane a couple of times. The passengers never got cranky because of the high degree of professionalism and good vibes from the crew. I have never had a bad flight on Alaska and it is always my first choice.

### Alaska Airlines customer review
Returned last week from my annual trip to Reno from ANC. The flight out was fine good service clean plane and landed a few minutes early in SEA. The flight to RNO was great on Horizon good crew with great service. The only complaint I have are the gates at Portland for the "Seattle Shuttle" are pretty crammed together and I accidentally tried to board the wrong flight. The gate agent pointed this out to me and was a bit short attitude wise. I asked about how many flights are leaving at 3.30? She said "one at that time and the one you are on starts to board at that time and leaves at 4! I was not the only person who had this issue but no problem after that. I got to SEA and the flight home to ANC was fine. I will be flying them again this next Monday going to SMF. I expect my flights will be fine.

### Alaska Airlines customer review
SEA-KOA my first ever flight with Alaska. Check-in at SEA was quick and efficient. Onboard I was positively surprised by the seat pitch; much more leg room than on most other airlines (and I am quite tall). Flight itself was partly bumpy due to weather but the crew cheered everyone up with free Mai Tais shortly before reaching Hawaii. Never had that with any other airline. Flight was on time the food for purchase was OK. Overall a very good experience. Will certainly use them again.

### Alaska Airlines customer review
My first experience with Alaska Airlines. I didn't expect the level of service from the stewards onboard. My two young sons myself and my wife traveled from Edmonton to Seattle and then to Honolulu. The stewards dealing with objectionable passengers children running up and down the aisle were professional and polite. I was able to extend my legs into the aisle without being harassed to remove them. On return bad weather delayed our connection.

### Alaska Airlines customer review
Flew on Flight 447 from LAX to SEA. Codeshare with Qantas. Plane was modern but interior looked dreadfully tiresome. For a low cost carrier their seat pitch was amazing. Cabin crew friendly and engaging with passengers. Besides the typical buy-on-board they give you something for your metabolism and non-alcoholic beverages are complementary. I ordered one of their buy-on-board but the crew forgot to serve it to me even though they have charged my card and all. Thus they ran out on that option after serving it to all the other passengers. Cabin crew's apologies were sincere and they did their best to make it up for me.

### Alaska Airlines customer review
Flew first class from JFK to San Diego flight 769 on April 1. And it did feel like an April Fool return to 1955. No pocket with safety info and sick bag no blankets or pillows provided stewardesses never once went through to collect trash. Food was allergy-unfriendly with bowl of mixed nuts for appetizer and a nut topped parfait for dessert. Worst of all though was the feeling of no safety consciousness. The two stewardesses functioned as - hostesses. Three young men each kept coming up repeatedly to ask a question use the bathroom get a soft drink. The boys would stay in the food prep area for several minutes chatting and then linger in the first class cabin to perform stretching exercises. On all other airlines that I've been on this kind of thing is just unheard of. I would not fly this airline again.

### Alaska Airlines customer review
Rebooked onto Alaska due to cancellation of my original flight on UA from SEA to LAX. The aircraft was pretty worn (737-400) and the IFE non-existent. The legroom was frightening. Once the pax in front of me reclined my knees were against his seat for the duration. Cabin crew were good and service was perfunctory. However I could've done without the 5 minute announcement ploy for their credit card and corresponding benefits (not to mention the FA walking down the aisle with applications). Got me from point to point but I have to say I wasn't really that impressed.

### Alaska Airlines customer review
Had our reservations with other connecting flights and rental cars for 3 days on Oahu and 7 days on Maui this coming June. We were very excited! Then we checked our itineraries and Alaska Airlines cancelled our return flight #883. Alaska re-booked our Honolulu departure 12 hours earlier but we would not get back from Maui to catch it until 8 hours later. They gave us 2 choices: the earlier flight or full refund. Very nice Alaska especially considering the inter island flight is non-cancellable nor are the rental cars etc. Since we made non- cancellable tickets and obtained a confirmation from Alaska I will not ever trust them again.

### Alaska Airlines customer review
February 1 2014. Flight 381 from SEA (Seattle) to SMF (Sacramento). I paid the extra $50 for a first class upgrade. The upgrade was worth the $50.00 although leg room wasn't what I would have expected (I was in 1D behind the bulkhead). The food and complimentary wine were good the service competent. I would recommend Alaska based on my first class travel experience.

### Alaska Airlines customer review
I am an Alaska Gold 75K and due to all the flight time I am seeing an increasing amount of maintenance holds delays and flight impact due to demand maintenance. On a flight from SEA to PSP that was on gate hold for 30 minutes due to a cockpit printer malfunction. The pilots PA circuit also malfunctioned with very loud audio noise in the background that made his communication to the cabin almost inaudible. Given the monthly frequency of gate hold maintenance events I am seeing as a passenger I am concerned about the competency funding and oversight of their maintenance program.

I flew from San Jose California to Seattle. The service was ok the plane was on-time. Boarding was delayed 2 mins but we arrived in Seattle 15 minutes before schedule. Two weeks later I flew from Seattle to Los Angeles - it was a connecting flight perfect again. The service of the crew members were good the flight was on-time again and no problems with the baggage. It went directly to my final destination (Guadalajara Mexico). Both aircraft's were Boeing 737-900 they were very clean and comfortable the legroom was ok. If I can I will fly with them again.

June 2013. One flight from LAX to SEA and another a few days later from ANC to LAX. Friendly and professional crew (on board and at the airport) modern aircraft (B737-800 and B737-900/ER) departure and arrival on time luggage recovered 5 minutes after arrival. I would say only one thing: Next time I will fly with Alaska Airlines again! An excellent low cost company.

### Alaska Airlines customer review
I have been flying Alaska for many years. For the last several years I have been flying first class only and have been very satisfied with the food the service and the extra space. This last trip though made me wonder if I should continue to pay the substantial difference in price to be in first class. It was the space in the new plane. The space between me and the seat in front is closer. I had to struggle to get my bag under the seat in front of me when the passenger in front of me had his seat back. I'm 5'5' and 125 lbs. Also there used to be three big spaces under the 1st class seats for two people. Now there are two with one other smaller space big enough to fit a purse maybe. I don't like to use the overhead but I can change. There still seemed to be plenty of space between me and the passenger next to me. I like the three moveable light fixtures and the ability to direct air flow on the ceiling better. The food is still good and the service good. Although staff service on the majority of my flights has been "excellent" I can only honestly rate this last trip as "fair. I am grateful to her though for this information. I heard her tell the two passengers in front of me that staff call the new planes "slaveships" because there are 44 more seats (!) but no more staff (still 4) to serve passengers. She said something to the effect of "I feel sorry for the people in back. They get served so late or barely at all. I'm thinking that on my next trip coming up shortly I will go coach one way just to see if I can still justify paying the difference in price. But thanks to the overheard words of the staff attendant I will sit in the middle or closer to the front in coach so that I will get better service and won't have to wait forever. I will also plan to bring on board some food and a beverage. Overall I really like Alaska although I haven't flown any others for a long time. Maybe I will venture onto another airline just to compare. I never have trouble checking in no lost luggage airport gate staff friendly and professional. There are a lot of things I like about Alaska.

### Alaska Airlines customer review
My time on Alaska airlines was ok. I was flying from Sacramento California to Seattle Washington. The flight attendants were nice and cheerful. The flight left on time and the flight attendants gave us a bag of beef jerky for the inflight meals. We ended up landing about 10 minutes early and the only thing I recommend is that they add inflight entertainment otherwise I recommend that you fly with Alaska.

### Alaska Airlines customer review
I often fly on Alaska/Horizon flights between Montana and Seattle or Portland. My overall experiences have been very good. Flights even in winter have been on time and counter and plane staff have always been excellent. Value is very good compared with the few other carriers (Delta and United) that we have to choose from here in Montana. Seats on Alaska planes could be more comfortable as they are small and fairly stiff and uncomfortable but most flights are short so it is not a big issue for me. You can't carry on larger bags on the smaller planes but their a la cart process still allows me not to have to check in my carry on and pick it up after landing. Overall my satisfaction with Alaska is very good.

### Alaska Airlines customer review
Absolutely awful service. I missed a flight to Honolulu for business because my connecting flight (also an Alaska Airlines flight) was 25 minutes late arriving. I got to the departure gate for Honolulu in time to see the plane sit there for a few minutes before pushing back if only they have held the plane 5-10min so me and the half dozen other connecting passengers could make the flight. Worse yet they offered no hotel or even club accommodations even thought this was the last flight out and it was entirely the airline's fault that we didn't make the connection—service reps said it wasn't their problem since they were 'only' 20min late and blamed my booking. I'll never fly Alaska Airlines again.

### Alaska Airlines customer review
LAX-YVR-LAX. On the flight to YVR we were greeted with great service at the gate. The aircraft was nice and clean and had a lot of legroom on the B737-400. Even though we were delayed a bit we still had a good flight. The service was great. We had complimentary drinks and the food a cheese plate was delicious and was worth the $7 dollar price. On the flight out to LAX we were delayed from 6am to 11.45am due to maintenance issues. Because of this they rebooked all of the people traveling to Mexico and the first class passengers. They also gave $40 breakfast vouchers. This proves excellent service. Also the first officer took us on a tour of the cockpit which was really nice. Since so many people left this flight onto a flight to Mexico the flight was almost empty. The seats were very comfortable on the Boeing 737-400 and the food and service were great as well especially because they were handing out every order for free due to the delay. Because of this Alaska Airlines is a great airline and I definitely recommend.

Round trip Seattle to Fort Lauderdale family of 4 for a cruise Nov 8 return 16th. Great experience considering we go in with low expectations our own food iPads etc. I was watching the on-time performance for a few weeks prior to departure and it seems this flight leaves the gate early more often than being on-time and our experience was no different - we pushed off 10-15 mins early both coming and going. Crew were experienced polite and helpful. 3 drink cart visits for the 6 hour flight with in-between bottled water. Gate checked our carry-ons for free. All good.

Very pleasant flight that I expect to make frequently visiting daughter in Bend Oregon. Friendly and helpful staff: Went back to plane to recover my jacket. But I have 2 complaints: Elderly neighbor got a $65 ticket when he pulled over in the loading zone to answer my call on his cell (that I was late) and Alaska's Seattle wait room sure looked shabby. Otherwise a very good experience.

Recently returned from ANC-ATL-ANC in first class. I was quite pleased overall with not only the service attitudes of the cabin crew but also the layout of the B-900. The flights were all on time and the food was actually quite good. The crew from ANC to SEA (red-eye) was great with a flair for humor. I do not always travel upfront unfortunately but decided to give it a go wish I could do it every flight. No complaints here. I will continue to use Alaska.

I have flown several times with Alaskan Airlines over the past few years. I am Canadian and live 2.5 hrs from Spokane Washington. I have found all employees to be polite and helpful over the phone at check-in or while flying. I did have a flight delay in January but all passengers were kept informed of what was going on. I much prefer Alaskan Air over Air Canada. I will be flying with Alaskan again on Nov 6/13 to Hawaii.

Round trip Seattle to Houston. Everything as expected on time friendly crew arrived back in Seattle 30 minutes early. Have flown Alaska at least once a year for the past 10 years have never had a late flight or lost luggage. Companion fare is a great deal $99.00 + tax anywhere they fly. If you don't like the seats in back quit whining and pony up the money to sit up front.

### Alaska Airlines customer review
My main issue is the check in. Flight from SMF to PDX was on the small propeller jet. Those do not have overhead room for normal overhead luggage. But they don't tell you. Hence you are forced to tag bags at the gate and place on cart for checking just like regular checked bags. What if you had something temperature sensitive. It's stupid not to inform customers that the plane does not have normal overhead storage. On the return flight it took half hour to check bags because the airline was understaffed line oppressively long. If I fly Alaska again I will bring a backpack only that's sure to fit in the tiny overhead compartment. Tell us if we get normal overhead. That's all I ask.

I've flown close to 50000 miles this year - all on Alaska Airlines. I've been flying Alaska for 15 plus years. Most of my travel is up and down the west coast with a NY Boston Orlando Chicago trip thrown in on occasion. Overall Alaska has done an amazing job all around. I've had one bag go missing in the last 15 years. It showed up at my door before 8 am the next morning. The food choices are excellent in coach and the few times I've been in First Class it's been wonderful. Their beverage choices are extensive and you can purchase an entertainment system on flights over 2 hours. Alaska's flight attendants are great - very friendly and accommodating and most of them have a great sense of humor! The few times I've had to fly other airlines I've discovered there is no comparison.

I had not flown with Alaska Airlines for a number of years but had a good experience previously. I had a 6 leg trip this past week from LAX to ANC to FAI to Cordova to JNU and to SIT then finally to SEA. Every trip was on time or ahead of schedule. FA were attentive and polite. F&B service was good. I had the food purchase options on 2 flights and was very pleased. Not overly priced and was fresh with good flavor. Only downside was in LAX boarding was chaotic. Gate agent shows up 5 minutes before boarding so many confused passengers. On all flights I noticed the upholstery on the seats were quite worn. A little surprised when most flight were on 737-700 or 800 series aircraft. Anyway all in all a successful trip with Alaska Airlines. Flights on time and my baggage made every flight. I would certainly endorse Alaska Airlines.

Recently flew Alaska from Anchorage to SEA and then down to Redmond OR to take our daughter to college. The trip down was fine in all respects good service new 737-900 and on time. The trip to Redmond was on Horizon and they did fine as well. The return trip was Redmond to Portland then up to Anchorage again no problems. We departed a bit late from Portland due to a windshield wiper problem but due to the upper level winds due to the massive rainstorm in Portland we were just a few minutes late arriving in ANC. All in all good job all the way around by all crews and staff. I will fly them shortly to ATL and we will see how they do in First.

I was not looking forward to 6 hours in a 737 from Seattle to Kona in first. In actuality the trip was not bad at all. Decent leg room and meal service were all complemented by a hard working and friendly flight attendant who serviced 20 people on her own. Digi player was decently loaded for entertainment. By today's lowered standards this flight was quite nice.

SEA-ANC-SEA KTN-JNU JNU-ANC-HNL in B737s during the month of August. Managed to get a Row 6 seat in each of them which led to being offered priority boarding. Every flight was either on time or ahead of schedule. Excellent in-flight service. This is an exceptional American carrier in the north-west of the country. Being slugged twice for baggage despite travelling on a single itinerary was the sole gripe.

LAX-PDX. Very good early morning flight to PDX. Cabin a little tired and cramped but service was some of the best. The breakfast was actually really good - eggs benedict and bloody mary's. First time flying them and would again. They need to upgrade there interior product though as looks worn.

Flights Bellingham to Honolulu in Coach. Seats are tight but that's the sign of the times. Service was sparse. You are nickeled and dimed on everything now. Gone are the days of Wardair. Guess that's why they aren't in business. Miss the days when air flight was fun. Having said that out flights we good and we didn't really expect much more for the price we paid. Would take this trip with Alaska Air again.

Upgraded to First Class from JNU to ANC for $50 (1.5 hour flight). This was my 1st First Class experience and I was not impressed. Water was offered before take off. The plane was a slightly aged 737-400. At first the seats seem okay but they hardly recline and there is no adjustable headrests. This makes the seats unsuitable for sleeping in. There was also a lot less legroom than I was expecting. I wouldn't recommend putting a bag under the seat in front of you unless it is very small. Since it was morning we were served breakfast. Our drinks were served first along with the standard snack bag that's also served in coach. Then the meals were served. The meal was an egg and bacon French toast sandwich. It was okay but not very filling. I was expecting more for first class.

Horrible experience transferring from Flight 456 arriving in Los Angeles to Flight 4213 going to San Jose CA. Boarding pass said Skywest but it was actually American Eagle. On arrival at LAX there was no information about either Skywest no indication where it was located and no one who seemed to know. Asked a gate agent who told us it was terminal 8. She did not say it was American Eagle we were looking for. After much walking and asking several people a TSA agent said to go to gate 65 and take shuttle bus to American. Upon reaching American we were told to board another bus which took us to a building near but not even attached to terminal 8. The TSA agent and the individual opening the restricted zone for us at gate 65 along with the shuttle bus drivers were the only competent individuals who seemed to know that Skywest was American Eagle in this case.

Out of 6 flights on Alaska going from Santa Barbara to Kalispell Montana and back only one flight (S.B. to Portland) was even remotely on time. All the rest departed from a half to full hour after the scheduled time. This is the worst this experienced long time flyer has ever seen.

### Alaska Airlines customer review
Exceptional flight from PHL to SEA on Aug 6th. Everything from checking in online using the mobile app to the inflight experience was smooth cheerful and efficient. The new recaro seats in Y class was smartly designed and comfortable as Y class goes. Inflight crew were cheerful and chatty particularly the senior attendant. Virgin America has great amenities on transcon flights but I find Alaska to offer the best service!

Flew from Bethel AK to Anchorage AK on a 737-400 Combi. Flight left on time and service was great. Flight attendants were very nice and smiled. I purchased a Mediterranean Tapas picnic pack for $6 and it was very good. A couple of days later flew from Anchorage AK to Juneau AK on a lei themed 737-800 which is rare for the route (usually only 737-400s are flown). It was nice having an adjustable headrest but I noticed that the seats on the 737-800 don't recline as much as the seats on the older 737-400. The flight was pretty empty with only 50 passengers. The flight attendants seemed tired and didn't smile as much but the service was still okay. Flight left on time. 737-400 Combi's don't have inflight Wi-Fi but all the 737-800s do for a charge of $4.95 for a single flight pass. Overall Alaska Airlines is a great airline.

### Alaska Airlines customer review
Departed on time from DCA bound for SEA on a 737-400 window seat 16 impossible to move in or out while other two passengers occupied their respective seats. The individual on the middle seat wore the most puzzling attitude making it absolutely awful to even attempt to exit for a loo break for the 4 plus hour trip. Blame the ludicrous spacing that makes it an absolute necessity to require other passengers to co0operate multiple times during a long flight. From SEA to JUN still a fully loaded aircraft yet uneventful and more pleasant neighbor passengers. JUN to final destination PSG a short hour long hop. A short 30 min delay at SEA. Return PSG by way of WRG then KTN imposed an hour an a half delay due not to weather. We arrived late night at SEA and then off to catch a ride to a local awful Seatac Inn for an overnight layover. Flight back to DCA was more pleasant. FA mobilized quickly to keep the full cabin stocked with minute free snacks beverages in cups and purchased meals. Entertainment was avail at 10 dollars for a shared small screen pad which battery quickly ran out of charge. The DCA to SEA is a long flight on a regularly cramped cabin. The spacing between seats is insufficient for a 155 lb. 6 ft. man to exit the window seat without interfering or annoying uncooperative passengers. It is difficult to hold biological needs for such long travel distances.

### Alaska Airlines customer review
LAX-ANC-LAX. Seats were very comfortable and the staff service was great. They even gave us free peanuts and cookies! Although all of these were good the in-flight entertainment is horrible. It is basically an IPad that you rent at $12. Not worth it. Overall this was a great airline. I would definitely fly Alaska Airlines again.

### Alaska Airlines customer review
I flew First Class from Palm Springs to San Francisco on July 7th. I have flown First Class on this route many times in the past with Alaska. In the past they had a great choice of salad or cheese plate on the flight with great service. Now they have totally eliminated that and didn't even bother to ask if anyone wanted a refill on their drink which they served with a cheap bag of pretzels. The flight attendant did everything possible not to walk in First Class but stayed in the galley doing nothing. Standards have gone down on Alaska.

Flew from San Jose to Fairbanks via Seattle. A good trip. Flight was on time. We knew no food was served so took our own. AA guarantee that if you don't receive your bags within 20 minutes of the plane arriving at the gate they will pay compensation ($20 I think). Our bags arrived within this time limit.

### Alaska Airlines customer review
We flew from Seattle to Las Vegas with a connection in Portland as a direct flight would have meant hanging around too long. As we live in UK we were nervous that flights would be delayed given some negative reviews here. Everything went smoothly and right on time. We were impressed with complimentary drinks service given that similar budget airlines in the UK all charge for drinks. Our return flight direct to Seattle was again on time . We found baggage check in quick and friendly and with the exception of one rather curt stewardess everyone else was absolutely fine.

SEA-ANC-ORD I consider my two experiences with this airline poor ones! The staff are friendly but flights are often delayed! On board crew seem lost this made me feel very uncomfortable these days you pay for everything extra when you fly them even for the bags. Won't be flying Alaska again unless the price is right.

On time and even had two inflight beverage services from Los Angeles to Seattle. This was economy. On the way back to Los Angeles I flew First Class. Was nice to have a meal.

### Alaska Airlines customer review
June 2013 LAX-MZT-LAX first class. Horrible check in. One first class line which is really 2 lines that mould into one. We stood for 20 minutes as the line grew longer. Whoever designed this lobby should be forced to deal with it on a busy day. When we finally got to the clerk he was surly if not down right rude. He did not speak two words to us. Off to the "new" first class lounge. Small cramped dark. Good bar but the small selection of food looked old and un-appealing. I certainly would not pay to get in. Indifferent staff. Boarding was quick and easy. However after it was announced the rear door had been "armed" the crew allowed a first class passenger off the plane to purchase an upgraded ticket for his grandson. So we all sat and waited at least ten minutes for him. Inflight the flight attendants on both trips were excellent: attentive friendly helpful. Nice folks. The food? On the way down a limp salad with what I think were chicken strips and a raspberry soda pop for dressing. On the way back inedible pesto chicken. Absolutely unacceptable for the price of a first class ticket. At MZT it took 35 minutes for our baggage to hit the belt. The counter people were slammed trying to check in outgoing passengers so it was impossible to hold Alaska to its 20 minute guarantee. All in all first class is definitely NOT worth the price and I would not recommend it.

### Alaska Airlines customer review
I am retired and am fortunate enough to fly first class extensively and often on a variety of airlines both in the US and Europe. I recently flew first class with my wife round trip from Las Vegas to Anchorage and plan to never fly Alaska again. Every employee I had contact with was pleasant and courteous the planes were on time but the only benefit in flying first was the additional legroom. The outbound and inbound flights were 2 weeks apart but breakfast both mornings was the same and only thing what they called eggs benedict with turkey ham which was on a piece of dry bread and was tasteless. Lunch was also one choice a chicken salad on a tiny salad plate with out bread cracker or chip desert was one piece of rolled candy. There was no TV on the leg of the flight to Seattle to Anchorage they provided a small hand held screen with a choice of 4-5 movies and short clips. I have never had such cheap and thoughtless meals on any of my previous flights. I would never recommend this Airline but if your required to fly it don't waste your money on first class.

### Alaska Airlines customer review
SEA-MFR via PDX then PDX-SEA. All flights on time. Service great. No complaints except maybe the skimpy selection of beverages but these are such short flights.

### Alaska Airlines customer review
Flew from Honolulu to Newark return in First. Flew Alaska last year in first and was so impressed booked with them again. Great service and the meals are just some of the best I have had on a plane. Flights were on time except for a delay because of weather but that's flying for you. Cant blame the airline for that. The staff are helpful and polite. Love the small first class of only 16 seats. Makes it feel like being on a small business jet as very individual service. Again well done to Alaska and would fly with them again.

### Alaska Airlines customer review
SJC-OGG SJC-LIH SAN-BOS return in F on relatively new 737-800 aircraft. While Alaska planes may not have the "bells and whistles" of JetBlue or Virgin America Alaska succeeds by running a very reliable operation offering a decent inflight product and friendly service. From Bay Area to Hawaii I was able to upgrade to First via online check-in for $100. Worth every penny! Check-in was fast and no charge for 2 bags. On board pre-flight beverages offered and menus were distributed. Mid-range wine choices but glasses were kept refilled throughout. The Alaskan Amber beer is quite good too. Breakfast served in 2 courses and Lunch/Dinner in 3 courses and the pace of service was quite relaxed. A snack later in the flight. Food and portions were very good on all flights. Crew were very polite and addressed passengers by last name. One FA even personally thanked each passenger for their business at the end. IFE consisted of a "digeplayer" providing a wide choice. The touchscreen worked well and the picture was clear although the sound quality will be much better if you bring your own headphones. F seats are basic domestic F but the extra width and legroom certainly make the upgrade worthwhile. Best part is their excellent on-time performance. I've only encountered 2 delays in the past 30+ flights.

### Alaska Airlines customer review
We have been trying for two days to get to Fairbanks and have spent 15 hours in airports and not there yet. There has been delay after delay and none of them weather related. The delays and cancellations have all been maintenance and crew problems which seem to be a systemic problem with Alaska Airlines starting with their top management. This is Sunday and I tried to talk to a supervisor in the Anchorage Airport and was told that supervisors aren't available on Sunday.

### Alaska Airlines customer review
Victoria - Seattle - Maui return in First Class. The service was impeccable and breakfast on the outbound flight was very good and spread out over a couple of hours which helped pass the time. Lunch on the inbound flight was equally good with a choice of sirloin steak or sweet and sour chicken. Frequent offers of alcoholic and non alcoholic beverages throughout the flights. Individual entertainment tablets with a wide range of films and TV shows. Attendants were very friendly and attentive. All the flights departed on time and arrived on time. This is the first time travelling on Alaska First Class and it was well worth the additional cost. My only disappointment was The Boardroom at Sea-Tac. It was pretty drab with a poor choice of food/snacks (both in the morning and early evening). It is certainly not worth $45 a visit. It is not a patch on Air Canada's Maple Leaf lounges.

### Alaska Airlines customer review
LAX to DCA on May 23rd. Apart from one every other flight attendant was rude and scowled the whole trip. No greeting as we boarded the plane no follow through with promises to help provide first aid (or a simple bandaid after an injury) and no explanation for delays that occurred. The attendants seemed annoyed when customers asked for beverages when we were seemingly skipped. Overall this flight is miserable and the staff are far less pleasant than the attendants who work for foreign or even domestic airlines that I have flown with recently. Granted the lack of amenities on this older flight doesn't add much to the comfort of fl going across country but a pleasant attitude for the staff wouldn't hurt.

My flight from Honolulu to San Jose was delayed 2.5 hours today which made me miss my connecting flight to Atlanta. They then told me there were no flight tonight to the east coast yet while I was sitting with an employee waiting for new boarding passes for tomorrow a flight to New York was boarding right next to me. Not a full flight either! They changed my flight but then brought me outside to wait for a shuttle to a hotel. I was left on the curb with 5 suitcases and a duffel bag and waited an hour. I finally called the hotel and they told me the shuttle had stopped running at midnight. I ended up having to take a taxi to the hotel. The next day when I was boarding my new flight I had to pay to check my bags again. All in all I paid 60$ extra for re checking my bags a 15 dollar cab and absolutely no sleep. They had absolutely horrible customer service and late flights.

Round trip SAN/PVR April 4-12. Alaska's first is more of a "light first". Seats and legroom just so so. Same pasta dish on both legs served along side a small salad. No roll butter or dessert. Flight attendants on both legs were great they seemed embarrassed about the meal quality but kept drinks flowing and were very pleasant. Both flights on time. Travelled on BA award tickets.

ANC to RNO with stop in SEA. I must admit that I was pleased with Alaska and Horizon Air in both directions. I flew their 737/8 on the way down and the 900 model on return. Planes were clean service was much better than I have had in the past. If they keep it up I may end up with them again soon. Good job and a decent price for what I received.

We travelled overnight from Seattle to Orlando and were seated in the very back row of the plane. These seats are hard up against the back wall of the plane and do not recline. It was a most uncomfortable trip I can remember and would definitely recommend avoiding travelling with Alaskan Air.

### Alaska Airlines customer review
I flew to Las Vegas March 29th and returned April 1. First class round-trip $777. Service down was slow and we were served a cheese platter. Not a significant midday meal but it was sufficient. Returning was worse. Nearly an hour before cocktails were delivered. We were not served the cheese platter. We were served hot pasta in cheese sauce on a sad looking salad bed. I asked the Flight Attendant for the cheese platter instead as I heard them offering it to the coach passengers. She advised that I would have to pay for it. She was rude and smug. Apparently I can drink you dry of scotch but have to pay additional for a decent meal. In addition after being served our drinks another Flight Attendant came up to us and asked if we wanted our pretzel bags as they did not have enough to serve coach. I have been flying Alaska Airlines since 1973. This is the worst service I have received coach or first class. Flying 1st class is more than a wider seat. It represents a gracious and superior attention to the passengers for which a premium is being paid.

### Alaska Airlines customer review

Flew from Anchorage to Seattle with a seat on a plane from Seattle to Vegas. The weather was bad in Anchorage but the pilot assured us we'd make our connections. Got to the gate in Vegas 21 minutes before the flight was set to leave. The Las Vegas crew was alerted that 45 of us from the Anchorage plane were bound for Vegas. The gate agent would not let us on the plane. Smiled smugly and said sorry. We all went to the customer service centre where a man told us we were lucky to get seats on the 9.35 flight. While I was at customer service I noticed the Vegas plane was still at the gate - 20 minutes later. I paid almost $1800 for this experience. Clearly Alaska Airlines isn't interested in customer service.

### Alaska Airlines customer review
DCA-LAX on a 737-800. Plane pushed back from the gate 15 minutes before scheduled departure time and was in the air right on time (I can't remember the last time this has happened). Aircraft was very clean and the leather seats were very comfortable. The crew did 3 drink runs and we received plenty of updates from the flight deck which I always appreciate. Will definitely consider flying them again since they have a codeshare agreement with American Airlines.

Seattle to Maui return. Planes departed on time and arrived slightly early both ways. Baggage was already waiting for us when we arrived in claim area. Attendants were very courteous and pleasant. Food purchased was just fine-deli pack. I usually travel Alaska if possible and have not had anything to complain about. They have always departed on time and done a good job!

SFO-SJD return. The flight to Los Cabos left and arrived on time the return flight left half an hour early but was required to circle SFO for almost as long before landing. Snacks on the 2hr 40min flights were edible nothing more. FAs were attentive. Seats were comfortable but legroom was as tight as any I've experienced in a first class (or business class) cabin. Alaska now departs from the new SJD terminal it lacks some of the features - dining options in particular - that made the "old" one a pleasant place to await boarding.

### Alaska Airlines customer review
First class KOA-PDX. Flight was on time. Seats fine. Food fine. In-flight entertainment (individual hand- held devices) fine. Nothing spectacular but we had no complaints. We chose Alaska over Hawaiian because it was fully refundable in first class and also non-stop from Kona to Portland where as Hawaiian was not unless you purchased a much more expensive ticket.

### Alaska Airlines customer review
Staff indifferent and rude. We had a 4 hour delay from Kona to Portland and they offered no inflight freebies to compensate. Going to Maui they kept serving alcohol to passengers that were drunk.

### Alaska Airlines customer review
Alaska Air has a bad reputation because of frequent flight delays. We weren't surprised when our flight was delayed several hours in Kelowna BC on Feb 22nd. We then missed our connections in Seattle and in Portland to Maui Hawaii. After all the delays we were looking forward to finally boarding our flight to Maui and sitting in our first class seats for which we had paid a lot of extra money. What a disappointment! It was an old dirty plane with the most uncomfortable seats we have ever experienced. The seats were old and worn and lacked cushioning. To top it off the backs reclined only about 5 degrees. The inflight entertainment was of such poor quality we couldn't use it - the audio and screen were awful. We are vegetarians and Alaska Air only offers fish and chicken. The good thing about the flight were the flight attendants who were pleasant and cheerful. We arrived in Maui and because of all the delays we were up 24 hours before being able to finally get to bed. So all in all we were not happy customers. Alaska needs to improve their planes and give much more thought to passenger comfort and service. We have been to Hawaii 20+ times on other airlines and never had such an uncomfortable flight as on Alaska.

### Alaska Airlines customer review
I recently flew round-trip from Boston to Seattle on Alaska Airlines. I was happy that we: 1) arrived safely 2) arrived on-time. I didn't check a bag so cannot rate their handling of my luggage. I was surprised to learn that even on longer haul flights in-flight entertainment was not complimentary as it is on other airlines. In addition the food offerings had no hot meal suitable for a vegetarian at any meal. My seat on the flight to SEA was very uncomfortable but adequate on the return flight. Alaska Airlines got the major points right but there's plenty of room for improvement!

### Alaska Airlines customer review
LAX-SJD-LAX Feb 15 First Class. What a disappointing experience. We purchased (not upgraded or miles) first class tickets to Cabo expecting a lot more. The first class seat pitch was awful in rows 2 and 3. Very cramped! Forget it if the person in front of you leans back at all. It also appears that the 3rd (and last row of 1st) has minimal seat recline. The condition of the seats : The leather was very distressed marked up and very worn. When we boarded at Cabo for the return flight to LAX there were crumbs all over the seats and floor. The food (both ways): a chicken sandwich with a single tomato slice some orzo and a piece of chocolate. Not even packets of salt and pepper accompanied the trays. I'd say this product is an embarrassment to this airline.

### Alaska Airlines customer review
Flight was late on both legs of round trip. The food advertised was not available and what was available they ran out of so we could not feed our 3 yrs old. When my husband complained the flight attendant happened to find something. There should be enough food for the passengers especially when you're landing at 10.30pm.

The day we were to depart was a bad weather day for the North Eastern part of the country and the aircraft we were to take from Reagan International was delayed due to weather. When we arrived at the airport shortly before the flight I received a call regarding this delay. When we finally go to the ticket counter the agent informed us that we would more than likely miss our connecting flight and they wanted us to depart from Dulles. After speaking to the customer service agent we were informed of the situation and they would pay for a taxi to get to Dulles send our bags and upgrade us on the United flight to first class. We got to Dulles with time to spare boarded our flight and got to California early enough to get a good nights rest before catching our connection. End result we arrived to our destination refreshed on time and ready. Our luggage arrived with us as well.

DCA-SEA Dec 24 Y class. Orderly bordering and flight left on time (it helped that DCA was practically empty at 5pm on Christmas eve).

Just flew from Vancouver to San Diego via LAX with Alaska. 2nd segment was with a Delta Regional operating for Alaska. My bag which was checked through did not arrive. Airport rep said it was the 3rd day in a row this had happened on the Vancouver flight.

I have been sitting in Calgary airport for 4 hours with little communication from the staff as to what is going on. First they have us board the plane and the plane is not even functioning. Then they have us sit on the plane for over an hour before telling us what is going on. Then finally they instruct everyone to get off the plane and wait. And wait. And still waiting. Finally an hour later they board us again saying everything is repaired and we are ready to go. Oh but wait we are still sitting here waiting with no communication from the flight team. I will never fly them again.

I flew from DFW to Seattle then on to Honolulu. Interior of the planes are shabby and worn. Seats are hard and narrow with minimum recline. No pillows blankets or footrests. FA tossed a bag of mixed nuts toward my hubby by the window seat couldn't she have handed it to him?

### Alaska Airlines customer review
I started flying another airline about 2 years ago but today decided to give Alaska another chance. I was sorely disappointed. The ticketing agents greeted me with frowns and a cold mechanical demeanour. The woman managing the line was condescending and seemed irritated with everyone. When I boarded I found my seat 3-A to not fully recline. The amount of leg room wasn't enough to cross my leg at the ankle and the general appearance was worn out and dirty. Once we were in the air the man in front of me reclined and I was no longer able to reach my bag under the seat. Now I would expect this in a coach seat but again they're calling this first class. I was served a lacklustre although well presented breakfast of eggs with tomato and asparagus a potato cake and fresh (ish) fruit. The flight attendant in my cabin was prompt and polite but the announcement about Alaska air credit cards droned on for what seemed like an eternity. Alaska built a reputation with exceptional customer service and a clean well maintained fleet of aircraft. Today booth there workforce and equipment seems to be in need of a serious overhaul.

### Alaska Airlines customer review
I fly Alaska a lot - MVP Gold for several consecutive years. I maintain this status mainly through partner airline miles. The main reason I stick with Alaska is that they have direct flights to two of my primary destinations from SEA where other airlines have stops in between. Service on Alaska is wildly variable. One flight will be the best service I can remember and the very next flight will be painful and unpleasant. So - if you are lucky and get a newer aircraft and a good crew you are good to go. If on the other hand you get one of the worn-out planes and/or a crew that couldn't care less if you were there or not.

Flew from SFO to Seattle Seattle to LA and then Seattle to SFO. Check in and boarding was seamless - for each flight we departed either on time or ahead of the scheduled departure time and luggage was always ready to be picked up within 20 mins of exiting the aircraft. Flight crew are friendly. Will fly with them again.

SFO to Seattle. Printed my boarding pass and was waiting to board my late night flight back to Seattle which was delayed by 3 hours. When I checked my options for changing the flight I was told its a non refundable ticket and to change was $100. Staff do not appear trained to be polite and offer service. We waited for passengers from a connecting flight to arrive this consumed another 30 minutes.

### Alaska Airlines customer review
I choose Alaska over United on my flights from LAX to PDX or SEA because they fly 737 and not commuters and offer a better Coach product than United. Crew seems happy to be there and they have hot food to purchase with good coffee! Having Wifi is a plus as well.

### Alaska Airlines customer review
SEA-ANC return in First. On the way up Anchorage was expecting bad weather. The FAs who had already delayed providing any first class service until about 50 minutes into the flight decided more than an hour out of ANC to prepare the cabin for landing. They got on the overhead and informed everyone that the captain had ordered this then promptly ceased service closed the restrooms and plopped down in their jump seats to chat. (This was clearly visible from First.) About a half hour of smooth flying later the pilot got on the intercom and announced that the FAs should begin preparing the cabin for arrival. It was obvious he had no idea the FAs had ceased working 30 minutes earlier. Alaska really needs to do something about its FAs. They used to be the best in the business such that it was a real treat to get to fly Alaska on this leg; now this route in particular is staffed by burnouts. I get better treatment on Delta for my Alaska frequent flyer status than I do on Alaska.

### Alaska Airlines customer review
Traveled to and from Anchorage from Kansas City in Sep 2012. Amazing to find the Alaska Airlines structures built in several airports to squeeze hold baggage fees from customers - but poorly staffed. Lines were longer when standing in line to check bags where baggage fees had been earlier paid on the web by credit card. On the full flight back from Anchorage to Seattle on 17 September I don't know that I have ever been packed tighter in an aircraft. I am not a tall man and my knees were in contact with the seat in front of me for that uncomfortable 3 hour leg. I know the economy is tough and the airline business intent upon wringing the last buck they can from the consumer but Alaska Airlines has taken this to a new level. I felt for the flight attendants hawking meals video devices and other such up and down the aisle. In Seattle prior to the last leg to Kansas City they gave us a start by posting a 7 hour delay- with no explanation whatever. Fortunately after 20 minutes of angst the original departure time was reinstated. I last traveled to Alaska on Alaska Airlines quite a few years ago and the present experience in coach was like night and day.

### Alaska Airlines customer review
Flew Newark to Honolulu via Seattle and Bellingham First Class. First time with Alaska. Very impressive. Seats comfortable food was great. The flight from Bellingham to Honolulu had the best airline food I have had. The crew were friendly on all legs. One thing that did annoy was that even though an announcement was made at the start of each flight that the front toilet was for first class only during the flight Economy passengers would use it and not be stopped. The digeplayer was not up to the standard of in seat units and did not have a good selection. But overall excellent flights. Would fly with them again.

### Alaska Airlines customer review
Alaska Airlines is slightly better than other major U.S. carriers. Like the legacy carriers they have also done away with blankets entertainment and free coach food. Fortunately flight attendants were actually kind and I did find the seats to be noticeably more comfortable. Having a friendly smiling crew and a nice seat made quite a difference.

### Alaska Airlines customer review
Heading to Disneyland for our daughter's sixth birthday. Planned well in advance and when it comes to checking in they have separated the three of us with their updated seat assignment. We all have the same last name an it clearly states that we're travelling with a child. Get to the gate only to be told by the agent that she can't do anything and we should ask the flight attendants to find us seats together. We get in the plane and explain the situation to the flight attendants and they now tell us that hey can't do anything and we're out of luck. Maybe someone will be nice enough to switch seats with you". Is this really how you handle mistakes? By passing the buck and doing nothing? A complete disappointment from a company that has obviously forgotten what customer service means.

I booked a one way trip from Seattle to Los Angeles and after reading some of the negative comments I was a little concerned. It turned out my worries were unfounded. I booked my trip online some time before the trip and got a very reasonable price. I was able to select seats on reservation and was able to change them when checking in online. On arrival at Seatac check in was smooth and swift and the boarding process was well organised. Staff on board were pleasant and informative and I found the on board wi-fi excellent - and cheaper than what some hotels charge! All in all a very pleasant flight and would certainly use Alaska again without any hesitation.

One way from San Diego to Seattle in first class. I paid approximately $450 for the seat. The extent of the food service on the 2.5 hour flight was a fruit and cheese plate. Pitiful to describe and worse to eat. There was also absolutely no in-flight entertainment no headsets and no video.

### Alaska Airlines customer review
We were very disappointed during our 4 weeks trip around Alaska and way to Hawaii with Alaska Airlines. We used it for many flights. SEA-JUN JUN-CVA CVA-ANC Fairbanks-Barrow Anchorage-HNL and HNL-SEA and always the same opinion. Old dated planes service near zero (no free meals) just peanuts and drinks. You have to pay for your luggage when you don't travel only around Alaska: for us a total of 80 USD. More over no entertainment you have to pay 10$ to watch old movies. To conclude crew not very friendly.

### Alaska Airlines customer review
I already checked into my flight and got my boarding pass at the airport. However with Alaska you have to wait in line to pay for your luggage separately (is this something new?). By the time it was my turn to pay for my luggage they said my luggage was too late for the flight. The luggage needs to be paid and checked in 40 min before the flight. As a result they took my boarding pass away and switch me to a flight 8 hrs later. Because of the huge delay my business activities all have to be sacrificed.

### Alaska Airlines customer review
I showed up 2 hours early but a TSA-Alaska problem made me miss my flight. Their small print symbol calling for additional security screening was missed by TSA so when I went to board they had to send me back to TSA and I missed my flight. The worst part is that they wouldn't put me on the next flight to my destination (on another airline) and made me wait 5+ hours for another Alaska flight. I would have been better off driving. I'll avoid flying with Alaska air in the future if I can.

### Alaska Airlines customer review
My husband and I were refused to fly because he had an airline approved oxygenator to take on as hand luggage and it would not be used in flight. We had purchased First class tickets to from Seattle to Hawaii they put us on another Airline those seats were economy and the cost of those tickets were $360.00 pp and we had paid over $700 pp - they gave us a refund of $105 pp.

LAX-PDX-BLI and BLI-SEA-SFO. All flights were completely full. Comfort on all aircraft's was surprisingly good. What lets them down is the staff. Robotic flight attendants going through the motions. Check-in staff in Bellingham were agonizingly slow. There were only two customers in front of me. 20 mins later there were still two customers in front of me. When I finally reached the counter my bag was 50.7 pounds. I am told to re-pack it. I took one shoe out of my suitcase and put it in my carry-on and she accepted my suitcase. On both Horizon Air flights (PDX-BLI-SEA) flight attendants sat in their jumpseats and read magazines the entire flight. My Alaska Seattle-San Francisco flight ended up arriving over an hour late. I had to run through SFO to catch my Air New Zealand flight. What a pleasure to be greeted at the door of Air NZ by smiling polite cabin crew.

### Alaska Airlines customer review
Found planes to be aged and shabby. Tray tables dirty would not want to eat off them. Staff seemed friendly but their uniforms were unimpressive. Had a delay out of Seattle and everyone was made to get off plane travel by train to another terminal to board another plane because of a broken seat. This was obviously known about before we boarded so they should not have put that plane back into service before it was fixed. Would not recommend this airline.

### Alaska Airlines customer review
Previously I have had mostly positive experiences with Alaska Airlines. However over an hour after boarding the plane we are still sitting at the gate waiting for maintenance and my 16 month old is getting fussy. I ask the FA if she can get us some juice to calm him down and am told no even though she is serving coffee to other passengers. 30 minutes later we are still sitting there and he is seeing everyone else getting drinks but him and starts to cry at which point the FA comes back and tells me to make him be quiet. I fly with my son almost twice a month and have never had a problem. On any other airline they would have tried to help the situation by talking to him or bringing a snack or a pair of wings. But not this one.

### Alaska Airlines customer review
Being based in Portland I am stuck traveling Alaska 75% of the time for business travel and was never impressed with the quality of the planes or service. Recently I used rewards miles for a trip to Honolulu. The plane was a standard 737 with absolutely no amenities. The overhead air barely blew. Service was terrible. Based on the most recent experience with their customer service I will try even harder to not fly Alaska and I am cancelling their rewards credit card. The other 25% I travel United and have never had a problem with their planes or service.

### Alaska Airlines customer review
I flew in from round trips OAK to HNL both flights were awful. The money I paid for these two flight's were great and that's the main reason I'm not too hateful towards them. The food was not bad. The staff service was good. The main reason my experience with Alaska Airlines was awful is because the actual aircraft's I flew in were horrible! The seats were incredibly small I was feeling very cramped during the whole flight's it was impossible to sleep on those plane's because the recliner's barely reclined. The leg room was ridiculous it's really hard to get up and go to the lavatory. The lavatory is also a bit small. There was not any complimentary in-flight entertainment expect the crew members offered screens to watch movies shows etc with a 10$ fee. Overall Alaska Airlines is mediocre. If you want a good price to go to Hawaii but understand that you will suffer cramped seats for 5 and half hours fly Alaska Airlines.

### Alaska Airlines customer review
Flew SFO to SEA. My 9.20am flight was over sold. I was bumped to another flight leaving from OAK 5 hours later. My return flight left 5 hours late after changing planes twice because of mechanical problems. Worst flight experience I have had on many years and I fly 50000 plus miles a year. I haven't flown Alaska in 20 years and I never will again.

### Alaska Airlines customer review
I would not recommend Frontier for those with connections. My flight from BNA-SFO with a connection in Denver was grounded because of plane problems. We were grounded in St Louis and agents were most unhelpful. I was stuck in St Louis and only got to my destination because I booked other flights in order to do so. Frontier does not do anything but give a 200 voucher for a missed connection. On my way back from SFO to BNA (connecting through Denver) we were grounded for a medical emergency which is understandable however no help given to those who missed connections. I got home on my own doing by booking a Southwest flight while we were grounded in Grand Junction. They have limiting options to help you out if you miss a connection.

### Alaska Airlines customer review
MCI-SEA-ANC- May 2012. All flights on time no delays. Had an excellent Tuscan pasta dish. Return was also without hitch long layover in SEA but got passes to the Boardroom and enjoyed to space and quiet. All of our flights on Alaska have been positive and enjoyable.

### Alaska Airlines customer review
I was flying from DCA to SAN with a connection in Denver. DCA to DEN was a nice enough flight with no complaints. However when my flight from DEN to SAN came they were unable to get a pilot. Keep in mind that DEN is Frontier's hub. This occurred at 10.10 pm and by the time I was able to speak with customer service the earliest flight that I could get to SAN was 9 pm the next day. Fortunately I did not have plans the next day but I know several people in the line who had to miss out on their plans due to this.

### Alaska Airlines customer review
Overall my flight was very pleasant. The crew were nice and friendly and for the most part the plane was clean. They forgot the digeplayers however and the wifi was iffy so definitely bring a ipad along with you with non-wifi apps. The headrests are annoying for shorter passenger as they are literally a pain in the neck. Overall Alaska Airlines was a cheap alternative to other airlines to Seattle.

### Alaska Airlines customer review
I bought tickets to fly myself and my 2 young kids (ages 4 and 2) from Salt Lake to Kansas City 2 months in advance. Inexplicably Frontier did not assign us seats together. For each of the 4 legs on this round-trip gate agents did a little shuffling to get us in the same row. But I still had to personally ask other people already on their seats to move. Travelling alone this wouldn't have been a big deal but with two little kids? Just getting on the plane and taking care of everyone's food potty and entertainment needs is stressful enough. Frontier made this such an unpleasant experience that I will avoid getting any tickets on Frontier again. When I said something about this to a flight attendant I got the response "Well that's Frontier for you!

### Alaska Airlines customer review
LAX-SEA-LAX-GDL in First Class. Alaska served the same meal consisting of a Chicken Sandwich and orzo pasta salad on all sectors. I was especially disappointed on the International sector of LAX-GDL. Alaska Airlines was on time for all sectors baggage was delivered promptly and the inflight cabin staff were efficient. They have to learn to vary their menu for First Class Passengers especially on International Sectors. Thus the mediocre rating.

### Alaska Airlines customer review
PDX-LGB return. While the flight was technically on SkyWest it is abundantly clear that this is an Alaska Air operation from the plane livery to the standard level of service given - which is to say a cut above. Clean CRJ planes 2x beverage service - no charge for microbrew beer or Pacific Northwest wines arrived on time with not much fuss. Only quibbles were the standard narrow CRJ seating and any food other than a package of pretzels had to be purchased. I liked the fact that the counter person suggested I check my bag plane- side avoiding the ridiculous $20 surcharge on all counter-checked luggage.

### Alaska Airlines customer review
OGG-SEA-BOS First Class. Flying in first class and not having to worry about paying $18 for the video player plus 2 suitcases each was almost worth it. We boarded on time and were given a plastic cup of water. The flight attendant took our coats and was polite and attentive. He let us know our food choices and was very attentive throughout the flight. We arrived early into SEA and had a 3 hour layover we went to the first class lounge in another terminal but had time to kill. Free food relaxing and comfortable lounge was appreciated. We boarded on time for BOS and again were given great service and lots of attention. I was pleased with my time in first class and just booked again for our return next Feb.

### Alaska Airlines customer review
ATL-SEA in First Class. Lamb dinner was very good. Service excellent. New version of Digiplayer entertainment system is a big improvement. Left on time arrived a little early. Seat comfortable. Couldn't ask for much more.

### Alaska Airlines customer review
I am a 75K elite status on this Airline and fly every weekend and also 1 million miler status since two years ago but sadly have seen a dramatic decline in service. First class not worth the cost. Upgrades even with my status are rare. Food is horrible. I recommend you stick with either American or Delta or United or Southwest for elite status. MVP Gold and 75K means nothing to the airline.

### Alaska Airlines customer review
I have been an Alaska Airlines MVP Gold passenger for 6 years. Each year the service and attitude slips in the past 2 years more than ever in crew attitude food portions and quality. The routes I fly for business are SEA-ANC SEA-DCA and SEA-LAZ. Last two round trips one to DCA and to LAX were especially bad. The plane had not been well serviced the food was not up to standard and FA's did not care about the over heated cabin. The sorry truth is that on the SEA-ANC and SEA-WDC flights Alaska knows that they can be poor and still outshine their competitors.

### Alaska Airlines customer review
We flew from Bellingham to Honolulu HI and back with Alaska Airlines. On the flight to HI we sat in row 23. By the time the food service got to us (I was willing to pay for food) they were out of the good food and only had things that no one else wanted to buy. Lousy service lousy prices. Late leaving HI for Bellingham by 30 minutes. This airline continues to go down hill. Years ago it was a great airline. Not so much anymore.

### Alaska Airlines customer review
Cost-cutting measures are showing more and more. Although first class is quite expensive it really isn't worth the extra expense anymore except for the larger seats and increased legroom. Meal service is a shadow of what it used to be just a few years ago. A recent flight from Anchorage to Seattle features a chicken curry salad that was frightful while the nice desserts have shrunk to a small piece of candy. Not impressed.

### Alaska Airlines customer review
Terrible Airline cheap with bad service. My plane landed in Seattle for a connecting flight at 10.40pm my connecting flight left at 11.00pm. Though the flight staff announced that all those people who needed to get on connecting flights be let off the plane first none of the passengers complied when we landed. Flight staff did nothing to ensure that folks who needed to get connecting flights got to them on time. I ended up at my gate at 10.55pm though flight staff closed the gate anyway no apology no help.

### Alaska Airlines customer review
We flew to Mexico in coach. Both ways they ran out of food and we were at the front of the plane row 8. Trying to get one of the attendants to serve you for a drink is a nightmare. We have flown many times and each time it goes down hill further. Our next flight is in First Class so lets see if it is any better. After reading the reviews I am not holding my breath.

### Alaska Airlines customer review
First Class is an expensive joke. An ageing fleet makes for poor seats and amenities. Food is poor - both legs of our first class trip brought the reality that only some in first class are allowed to order from the menu. For both legs we were given food that was unwanted and in fact inedible.

### Alaska Airlines customer review
YEG-SEA-LAX both flights were considerably disappointing. Food - all I had was a small snack. Drinks were good. Flight Attendants were hit and miss in responding to requests. There was no inflight entertainment. Seats weren't very comfortable with little to no space.

### Alaska Airlines customer review
I filled out everything from seat number to meal preference it turned out to be a waste of time. There is no food other than pricey snacks and the seats assigned at check-in. I was taken back by the lack of free onboard movies instead you have to purchase that too. As well as being turned away from using lavatory in front of airplane - that's reserved for higher paying customers. So not having been on Alaska in sometime I was very disappointed.

### Alaska Airlines customer review
YVR-LAX-YVR. Both flights relatively full and on-time. Great service FAs and surprisingly comfortable seats (though narrow). The only negative thing to point out is their terminal in LAX which is not good at all - overcrowded and dirty.

### Alaska Airlines customer review
ANC-SFO-PSP-ANC First Class. Flight attendants do not serve first class like first class. It's more like you're time warped back into what Coach used to be like. Drinks on offer before takeoff - tepid water poured out of an open common bottle into a plastic cup. Service after takeoff indifferent. Food not great. Interestingly if you request an alcoholic drink they bring you two mini-bottles of the alcohol but don't bring you the can of tonic/soda/whatever that goes with it so you can mix it yourself. Planes are exceedingly loud with announcements from FAs but if the pilot speaks you can't hear a word. Between that and the thin rocky seats make sure you pack your ibuprofen.

### Alaska Airlines customer review
My family and I were scheduled to traveled from DC to Seattle this week but we accidentally went to the wrong airport. Our mistake completely however you would have never guessed that considering the way the ground crew treated us. They immediately got us rescheduled on another flight to LA and on again to Seattle. They made sure we had our seats together as much as possible and were as hospitable as could possibly be. I've always felt that our prior experiences on Alaska Air were always good but I was truly impressed with their service on this last trip. I am certain that we would not have had such luck on any other airline. I want to thank Alaska Air for making a possible bad situation a positive and comfortable day for us.

### Alaska Airlines customer review
I've had to fly Alaska almost every Monday morning and Thursday evening for the past 2.5 months from Seattle to Oakland because of a project I was on. Their miles plan is quite generous and I will continue to book with them. Consistently good things about Alaska are their customer service quality (always respectful and accommodating) and on-time flight status (not one single late flight with the exception of a bomb threat which isn't their fault). Consistent areas for improvement with Alaska are their seat comfort (the adjustable headrests are good on the larger planes but the smaller ones lack them and the seat bottoms across are painfully hard across the board - a 1.5 hour flight should not have me in physical pain at the end of it) their wi-fi offerings (there is no way I am paying $10 for slow internet access for 1.5 hours; that's absurd) and their MVP Gold status is so heavily overloaded now that it seems like the majority of the flight is boarded early by them rather than normal flyers (they need to consider revising how these points are earned and applied). Overall I have enjoyed them however and I will continue to use them for my return flights now that my weekly commute has moved to a Seattle-to-Houston trip (there are no nonstop flights going to Houston on Sunday afternoons with Alaska or its partner airlines so I'll have to get there using Continental and come back on Alaska which is fine).

### Alaska Airlines customer review
I flew 6 hrs from Seattle to Kona on a full flight. The only toilets for economy were at the back of the plane. Being only one narrow aisle there was continual crowding and congestion up the aisle near the toilets. It was particularly bad for passengers in the back rows because they had people in the aisle crowding them the whole flight. We were not allowed to use the first class facilities at the front even though a couple of people did go through. An other annoyance was the frequency and volume of announcements. Please let us have some peace and quiet! We noticed the contrast with Hawaiian Airlines which was so tranquil and relaxing with no loud publicity of special deals and unnecessary announcements of impending drinks trolley.

### Alaska Airlines customer review
SEA-MIA. I had the misfortune of missing my flight the night before (my fault). I ended up flying out the next morning on my birthday my travel partner mentioned to the FAs that it was my birthday. They went out of their way and made me feel quite special. The FA asked me if I liked sweet or sour and soon came back with a special drink which he'd put dry ice in to make it bubbly! Then later they lent me a complimentary movie player. They were small gestures but really made my day. The service was great.

### Alaska Airlines customer review
On return flight from Maui we sat in the first row behind 1st class. My wife needed to use the restroom and must use a crutch to walk so she went forward to 1st class. I went to the back but was blocked by 10 people in line who were blocked by the serving cart so I returned to the front. My wife had returned to her seat and another lady was going through the door so I waited. Then a lady attendant seeing me waiting told me I must go to the rear. I explained that the aisle was blocked by the serving cart she insisted I go back which I did. After the long wait on the serving cart I finally reached the restroom. When I returned to my seat the man in the aisle next to me asked why I went back. He said while I was gone 3 people had passed him and used the front bath room without any harassment. I realized that this restroom is intended for First Class but at the same time a little reasonable attitude and common sense by the attendant would be appreciated.

### Alaska Airlines customer review
San Diego to Seattle return. The overall trip was excellent. The crew were nice and gave me a free extra snack. My carry-on was 2 inches larger than the maximum but the gate agent offered to consider it check-in luggage for no extra cost. Only negative point is that both landings were hard especially at San Diego.

### Alaska Airlines customer review
Flew nonstop Oakland to Kona. Its a much smaller plane than Hawaiian or United for example but seat size is the same. However there are no movies and music they will rent you small hand held pads. They only use one food cart in coach so if you are at the back you will wait over 1 hr after service starts. Food is reasonably priced. Staff are nice and helpful if you know what to expect its fine.

### Alaska Airlines customer review
Burbank CA to Seattle WA. My mother is quite elderly staff were very courteous from the moment she exited the car. She was supplied with a wheelchair with and pushed by a staff member to both the ticket counter and security without waiting and then helped onto the plane. The trip went without a hitch.

### Alaska Airlines customer review
The airline did got us to the destination however they re-assigned our seats upon check-in - to the lavatory row. I paid full fair for these tickets and spent 6.5 hrs with people standing next to us. When I asked to have my family back in their original seats I was told there was an equipment change. Apparently the computer runs the airline. The computer reassigned the seats and there is nothing a human can do to rectify the situation.

### Alaska Airlines customer review
Bellingham to Las Vegas return. The flight was great and they provided us a free snack and drinks. Seats were comfortable crew are very friendly. Both flights were on-time. The only negative is that don't have enough check- in counters and staff at Bellingham it was a mess lining up.

### Alaska Airlines customer review
MFR-PDX-LAS. Adequate flight to Portland with Horizon. Limited service and bumpy ride in crowded Bombardier. Great flight with Alaska in First after chaotic boarding at Portland. Pleasant cabin and comfy seat. Inflight service good drinks flowed freely though the meal wasn't to my taste.

### Alaska Airlines customer review
Puerto Vallarta from Los Angeles. Its only a 3 hr flight. We paid full price First Class not upgrades. First Class it was not. Besides the 737-400 being old and tired my seat was broken both ways. Seat pitch is the tightest I've ever experienced it was impossible to get up with the seat in front reclined. Food was awful there were zero amenities and pre-flight beverage service was water. I had to wait behind coach passengers to use the lavatory both ways despite the announcements alerting passengers about the usage of the front lavatory. The one bright spot was the use of their Board Room Lounge at LAX. Its very nice wonderful staff and plenty of amenities. Alaska needs to upgrade their First Class or go ahead and rip out the four abreast seats up front.

### Alaska Airlines customer review
BLI-HNL on 737-800. ALOHA card on seat with "Here's the Flight Plan" on one side and "Island Trivia" on the other side sets the Hawaiian mood. Complimentary macadamia nuts and mai tai near arrival leaves a good impression. FA's efficient served free juices and cookie. Does not compare with international flights on Asian carriers but about as good as can be expected nowadays on a domestic flight.

### Alaska Airlines customer review
San Jose to Spokane Washington. Flight out of San Jose was delayed the agent assured me I would make my connecting flight. We landed and my connecting flight was on time I ran across the airport only to be told the plane had left already. There no apology for the delay or missed flight staff were surly at the gate. Instead of responding to my concerns with some empathy and trying to make a positive difference they went out of their way to make it worse. I've never had this kind of experience with Alaska in the past and I fly with them fairly regularly.

### Alaska Airlines customer review
SEA to LAX. We were seated in first class row 1. When we tried to stow our carry on bags the crew had their stuff in our overhead. This forced us to use the overhead behind us which held those people's bags. Plus we got dirty looks from them. The same happened our return trip. We were appalled when coach customers lined up to use the 1st class restroom - why don't the attendants stop the coach from using the 1st restroom. When we pay for first class tickets we are paying for these "Perks" or so we thought. It is not our job to tell coach people the rules. It is Alaska Air's job to enforce them.

### Alaska Airlines customer review
We flew to Maui from PDX return - flight over was great the flight back seemed to be on a different airline. The attendants were rude and had no desire to accommodate even a very simple request. Also we paid for our bags going both ways and were only supposed to pay going one way that was an extra 40 bucks. We could have just carried them on like so many others. We paid the 14 bucks for a digiplayer but the headphone quality was so bad we couldn't hear anything. We were finally watching a movie that was very old not a new release as advertised but with 15 minutes left in flight and 5 minutes of the movie they took it away. Overall the return flight was a very inattentive and miserable looking crew.

### Alaska Airlines customer review
San Jose to Kona First Class. The seats are not First Class standard. The food was awful and the crew were rude. Also our First Class bathroom always had a line as they opened it to coach class. Something I have never seen on any other domestic airline. There are no First Class lounges in San Jose or Kona.

### Alaska Airlines customer review
LAX-YVR Economy. Boarding was a little chaotic and confusing as the announcements were not made clearly and sometimes hard to hear in the big departure hall at LAX. Staff seemed pretty laid back but were generally helpful. Nice to see an airline that still serves free snacks and drinks. 737-800 was in average condition with pretty basic interior decor.

### Alaska Airlines customer review
I booked an Alaska flight for a short trip to San Jose CA from Los Angeles. I have never had an experience like the one I did on the return trip. 10 mins into the flight the cabin told us that due to a high volume of air traffic we would likely be delayed about 15-20 mins and would have to circle over LAX while waiting for a runway to open up. We end up circling over LAX for about 30 mins which wouldn't have been a big deal either except that we didn't land at LAX we landed at Long Beach about 30 mins away by car or 1hr 30mins with LA traffic). Then sat on the tarmac at Long Beach for nearly 2 hrs this is a 1 hr and 20 min flight to begin with and was given no information whatsoever about the airline's plans for us. When certain passengers were permitted to debark they were informed that they would be unable to retrieve their baggage from under the plane and would only be allowed to take their carryon out. Most of us had figured that the airline would probably shuttle us over to LAX. Word comes over the loudspeaker that we're flying back to LAX and will be there in about 1hr. I was expecting to meet an Alaska Airlines representative to explain to us that we would all get vouchers for cabs missed flights etc. no such luck. Not only did no one make an effort no one was even around. I couldn't find anyone from the airline other than the uninformed pilot and stewardesses. In the scheme of things delays like this happen and are sometimes unavoidable. What I don't get is how an airline can turn an hour and a half into 4 hrs by failing to plan ahead.

### Alaska Airlines customer review
SEA-YKM on Horizon (connecting to international flights in SEA) but I have been a customer for over 15 yrs. The interior of their planes is standard but their service is what puts them above other American carriers. Numerous times when flying out of YKM and connecting in Seattle to Continental Delta BA etc they have waived second bag fees. Ground staff gate staff and FA are all helpful and genuinely want to make your trip easier. On their longer domestic flights Alsaka still has the full service feel that was the norm in the early 90s. What really sets the apart is that twice now my flight to YKM has been cancelled or forced to return to Seattle due to freezing fog and both times I have been given a full refund without argument from the call centre staff. Highly recommended by a very loyal flyer.

### Alaska Airlines customer review
Flew first class from Seattle-Chicago this week and was shocked at the poor cabin service. Cabin crew were ambivalent and made us feel unwelcome. The lunch offering - a bowl of soup a bread roll and salad - was very meagre. A very disappointing experience.

### Alaska Airlines customer review
In general Alaska Air has been my number one go to airline. They have been customer service oriented for as long as I can remember. The only bad experience I had was when I had MVP Gold status. I called the then Horizon MVP line and asked to have my husband seated next to me. They refused since he was not an MVP Gold. So I called the Alaska MVP Gold number and they put him next to me no questions asked. As for booking I recently booked a vacation through Alaska and had a difficult time. It would not pull in any of my account information from either my personal or EasyBiz account so I had to enter it all manually. Also unlike when you book just a flight you cannot pick your seats in their vacation page. I found both of these items to be frustrating. I doubt I will book a vacation through their site again. I will do everything separately.

### Alaska Airlines customer review
I was a little surprised to read the negative reviews of Alaska. I have always flown them and almost always satisfied and comfortable. Most recently I went Juneau to Kona and back with no complaints. I have found them better than other American carriers I have flown. Also of note due to flying in bad weather in Alaska most of their planes have cutting edge navigation technology in the cockpits.

### Alaska Airlines customer review
Los Angeles-Vancouver on 737-400. Attempted check-in at kiosk but unless you have a US or Canadian passport you need to check-in at the counter. Staff neither rude nor friendly just robotic. Boarding a bit chaotic as passengers push aboard to hog overhead lockers with their gigantic carry-on bags. Was greeted at the door by a flight attendant's back. I said "hello" but no response. Proceeded through first class and waited patiently while passengers blocked the aisle stowing their carry-ons. I was happy to wait however a flight attendant shoves her hand in my face and shouts "wait right there! I wasn't even moving! Walked past the first two rows of economy and noticed that they were smashed to pieces with a sign hanging that said "do not use". Not a good look. Airplane was totally full and the interior was showing it's age. Drinks and food for purchase served by frowning unenthusiastic cabin crew. Flight arrived on time baggage delivery fast. In the end they get you where you're going but like most North American based carriers staff are rude and unfriendly.

### Alaska Airlines customer review
We paid to fly First Class from Portland to Hawaii. Seats aren't much better than coach little leg room and hard seats. Inattentive flight attendants. No welcome drink prior to take off and the cabin was served drinks before we got ours. We used the call button and were told our FA was busy preparing our breakfast. Breakfast was fine. Digiplayer didn't have much of interest to offer. FA's disappeared after breakfast and were gabbing away. We rang again for another drink after about an hour and were ignored. Rang again and were berated for abusing the call button. Will never fly Alaska first class again stick with Hawaiian.

### Alaska Airlines customer review
SEA-LIH-SEA. Flight out was OK. We were allowed to sit in our assigned seats. Hard to sleep because of numerous really loud announcements about buying food joining the frequent flier club signing up for a credit card renting a video player etc. Flight back was bad. When we checked in online the day before our return flight we discovered that Alaska had changed our seats from our nice aisle seats to poor ones. When we called we were told that it was too late to do anything; we should take care of it at the airport. That we had written confirmations of our seats which we had repeatedly reconfirmed meant nothing. At the airport check-in line we were told we had to go to the gate. At the gate we were told it was too late to do anything. The gate agent was apologetic but said "it happens all the time. Everyone we talked to basically said "I don't know why this happened. We are very customer oriented. I can't help you. Flight back was notable for the sleep robbing announcements to sell the same stuff. Does an airline have to wake everyone up to find out how many are flying on miles so they can sell more credit cards? Couldn't sleep much anyway; seat didn't recline.

### Alaska Airlines customer review
First class Seat 4D on Seattle/Chicago run was horrible coming and going. Like sitting on a concrete bench. Not acceptable for First or Business Class. Also what's with the Board Room restrictions? I suffered a 6-hour delay at O'Hare but American (partner in the lounge) would not let me use the lounge without a Board Room card. With a delay of any length they should give complimentary day passes to premium customers. On the plus side Alaska cabin crews are the nicest in the business and food is really good.

### Alaska Airlines customer review
BZN-SIT-BZN. Thanks to having a friend who works for the airline we were able to fly standby over an extended Easter weekend. We got everything we should have had we been paying the regular fare - planes were on time crews were friendly enough baggage was unloaded promptly the snacks were unappetizing the cabins were clean and seating was comfortable enough. We appreciated the efforts of the gate staff in Seattle to keep us informed of seating status on a full flight to Sitka (we were the last ones on the plane). The only complaint I have is a mild one and while not the airline's fault I mention it in hopes that maybe the airline will lobby a bit harder - the waiting area at the Sitka airport past security is cramped and without restrooms or any other amenities and the only food outlet at the airport was closed for the holiday.

ANC-SEA-SFO-SEA-ANC First Class. Outbound uneventful and reasonably good service in First. Back was another story. Surly male flight attendant who was uninterested in serving in First Class. No service for the first 90 minutes of the flight. Service when it appeared was lackadaisical at best. No refills of drinks. Flight crew sat in jumpseats ignoring passengers (including me) who were trying to use restroom. Restroom appeared occupied for long period of time. Turned out the flight crew just couldn't be bothered to turn off the "locked" sign for about two hours of a three hour and 20 minute flight. I am looking forward to competition in the Alaska market arriving this summer.

First class from Sea-tac to Maui and back. My friend did an upgrade for an additional 360$ to join me. Service was no smile food was so so the bathroom had a constant line from the back. I asked for a Mai Tai no! Everyone got a pre-mix at the end of the flight - we got about 10 nuts in a pack (same as coach) with that. I wanted a snack and was told the cheese and fruit plate was for coach only - lucky me they had extra and I purchased it for 7$. The only good things about this flight were the seat (large) and my bags were there. Be advised to bring your own pillow and blanket because Alaska won't give them to you - and my flight was freezing!

Had reservations for the family to go on spring break to California from Seattle. Not any more. Because of a computer failure all their flights were cancelled during the time period that my flight was to leave. Of course none of this was announced anywhere even on their website which I checked before we left for the airport. Got to the airport and walked into the ticketing area and huge lines of people everywhere all for Alaska Airlines. After two hours in line a customer service agent came by down the line and told everyone who had tickets for this morning that "you might as well go home". She said that all the other airlines were full that it would be 4 to 5 days before people could be rescheduled for their destinations. She did say that "Alaska Air would waive their normal rescheduling fee" That was it. No other explanation. If Alaska Airlines wants to pretend they are a big airline they need to quit treating their customers like dirt. What kind of company does not have a back up to their main operating system. The news said that they were updating their system. What company would run an update during one of the busiest travel weeks of the year. Now I get to spend my time trying to get refunds from hotels cars and Disney Land.

Going on a flight from Vancouver BC to Los Angeles on Alaskan/Delta air and found out that a checked on bag will cost about $25 each way (there are 4 of us $200 extra) but if I went to Mexico checked bag would be free. Alaska and Delta both stated that was because Mexico is an international destination but the US is not. Really? US Canada and Mexico are on the same continent but how can the airlines say that the US is not international travel from Canada or visa versa? We must depart from the international terminal we need a passport we have to go through customs we can buy duty free products.

SEA-LAS. One of the very few direct flights to Las Vegas from Seattle so choice is very limited. I ask for very little on a short haul flight. There was a free soft drink and the usual packet of indescribable pretzels. Decent seat size and overall a clean aircraft. Landing at McCaron improves any flight as it is one of the best domestic airports I have ever been to. Functional though unspectacular.

Kona-Oakland First Class. A very comfortable flight despite the conditions at Kona International (no loungeno wifi etc). B737-800) is adequate for the 5 hour flight. Great flight attendants good food and drink fairly comfortable seat and decent entertainment via a Digiplayer.

LAX-MEX-LAX January 2011. I had not flown on Alaska in quite a few years. This airline is in my opinion better than the average US carrier. B737-800 was clean newish and with pleasant staff warm snack. No baggage fee! Overall I would recommend Alaska Airlines.

OGG-PDX-LAX and OGG-SEA return. We live on Maui and use both Alaska and Hawaiian Airlines to travel. This is a new market for Alaska and we hope they continue to improve their service. These flights were okay - standard mainland business class. Food was average. Service was good and attentive. What is lacking is a seat with better pitch foot rests and pillows or blankets. Hawaiian Airlines give you a seat with about 140 degree recline leg and foot rests and pillows and blankets. Both airlines are attentive to needs but Hawaiian has the edge with unsolicited water drinks etc. Costwise Alaska charges about $300 less than Hawaiian. For the money and the additional comfort I want Hawaiian is the better deal. But keep trying Alaska.

First class from Atlanta to Seattle. The service was attentive and friendly. The meal on Alaska was beautifully presented flavorful and nourishing.

Returned on Alaska Airlines from Kauai HI. We had barely left the ground and it was announced "no fresh fruit" - yesterday's only. Then midway through the flight we heard "the system is out of water. There will be no more water to drink and please try not to use the toilets unless necessary - who goes into an airline bathroom unless it is necessary? I am only guessing but I think that if there was no time to get fresh fruit on board or enough water to last the flight perhaps the preventive maintenance wasn't done either. No apologies for lack of supplies and of course no coupon for future use.

LAX-PDX roundtrip. Service on this trip was better than the last few times I've flown this airline - in other words it went from dreadful to mediocre. Flights were on time and the interior was comfortable enough but inflight service was perfunctory and cold. At least this time I was spared the flight delays dirty cabins mishandled baggage and pitiful customer service I've come to expect of Alaska Airlines.

ANC-SEA-SFO-PDX-ANC. Most legs of this multiple leg round trip were relatively uneventful. The nickel and diming poor gate announcements surprise gate changes in SEA etc. have all become expected of Alaska Air. What is unacceptable is how unbelievably uncomfortable and filthy the cabins now are. Alaska has no excuse they're not short on cash. As for discomfort it is unacceptable to fail to pay close attention to climate control on a packed airplane. Usually you're freezing. PDX-ANC leg averaged about 84 degrees for the entire flight. Baggage claim continues to be a joke. Alaska claims to have a compensation program if your bags take more than 20 minutes to arrive. They must know nobody is going to stick around to make a claim for now-worthless Alaska Air frequent flier miles.

STL-SEA-ANC December 24-25. Upgraded on a whim at check-in in STL. Took a little time for the agent to get it taken care of. Some slight delay due to de-icing. First Class STL-SEA pleasant crew in a holiday mood. Safety briefing done to "The Night Before Christmas" fun and got people's attention. Good meal and attentive service. Economy class SEA-ANC. Crew was not as jolly as previous flight and the cabin was full. Still good service. All luggage there when we arrived in ANC early Christmas morning.

### Alaska Airlines customer review
SFO-ANC. Economy class flight was fairly good. The crew was courteous and efficient. The cabin was clean. Flight was on time and checked bags came fairly quickly.

LAX-MFR via Portland in first class. Both flights on time. Staff very professional. The "light meal" seemed rather skimpy since this flight took place around dinner time.

### Alaska Airlines customer review
Very pleasant flight in Y-class from Newark to Seattle on Christmas eve. Online check-in to boarding were all a breeze. Clean plane leather seats and friendly and professional flight attendants that offered frequent beverage service. Two attendants in particular were warm friendly and professional and made the flight quite enjoyable.

Seattle to Kelowna BC and the boarding procedure was chaotic. They boarded three flights at the same time through a single gate. Upon arrival at the aircraft boarding zone there was no clear designation on which flight was which. As a result many passengers boarded the wrong aircraft and had to change planes shortly before departure. The same system applied to loading luggage which of course ended up being lost. At my destination I was told to expect a call from the central luggage department but this never happened. I called and got different versions on the status of my luggage: the first agent said it would be here on the afternoon flight the second agent said it had been scheduled but they were not sure whether it had arrived or not and the third yet most unprofessional representative Linda simply hung up when I asked her if anyone could guarantee that my luggage would be sent on a specific flight. It's sad to see such substandard logistics management for Alaska Air because the in-flight service was outstanding. Undoubtedly I will be sure to avoid this airline on my next trip to Canada.

SEA-PHX in first class for the holidays. The first leg left an hour late due to the lavs not working. They brought around water and orange juice while waiting the hour on board. Breakfast served was pretty tasty. Return trip left on time drinks served quickly. Dinner also very tasty. Landed back in SEA early and checked luggage was very prompt. All in all Alaska air is improving their first class experience.

Miami-Seattle. The inflight experience was great however it was a different story at the airport. Alaska Air is located in concourse E (or Central Terminal) at Miami Airport. The ticket counter area is small and a very inconvenient part of the airport. Unless you arrive very early for check in the line will stretch to where it will block the entrance to a food court behind the counter the exit path of Concourse E the entrance to a TSA check point and the exit of Customs located just below them. The flight departs from Concourse F and the upside to the airport is that there are only about a handful of flights departing from F that morning so TSA checkpoint a breeze. Boarding process was poor there were no pre boarding announcements and passengers just saw other's making the line to board and assumed it was time to board no matter what row they were in. The cabin crew was attentive and cheerful there was actually space in the overhead bins. The seats were comfortable however seat pitch was terrible! Alaska offers Gogo inflight internet and they rent DigEplayers which come with movies/games etc. The flight was 6 hours 24 mins - I had no idea a 737-800 had such a long range. The meals they served (or sold) onboard were fair at a reasonable price. We had the option for a hot or cold meal. Given the long length of the flight the crew did go around the cabin about 3 times for beverage service.

### Alaska Airlines customer review
PDX-LAS B737 a pleasurable experience. After a 4 hour wait at PDX we were very relieved to get onto the aircraft. The aircraft was a little outdated but crew more than made up for it. Very attentive and professional. Overall very efficient.

LAX-BLI one way combination of Alaska and Horizon Air. This flight was better than my other experiences on Alaska/Horizon which isn't saying much. Nothing went wrong but the fare was higher than its competitor Allegiant Air and the onboard service and seating were poor. The unionised drone cabin crew couldn't care less about the customer. Horizon Air's DHC-8-400 props are noisy and uncomfortable. Allegiant Air despite their very inconvenient scheduling offers better service and better value for the money.

DFW-SEA-YVR. DFW-SEA sector in first class. Crew were very chirpy for early morning flight wih smiles all round and quick service. Seating ok for domestic First and digiplayers offered free of charge. SEA-YVR with Horizon air. Gate staff pleasant as were crew. 40 minutes after boarding crew were unable to close door and we were deplaned and sent back to terminal where we informed flight was cancelled. Ground Staff were excellent handling the situation and re- booked me on the next available flight with Air Canada. Bad situation made good by well trained friendly (even got a smile) and empathetic ground staff.

Vancouver to Portland on Horizon (Alaska Air's partner for the short hops on puddle jumper planes in the Northwest) on a Q400. Check-in went well with assurances that the flight was on time. Then once aboard our plane we sat and we sat at the gate until the pilot informed us that there was a mechanical problem. The passengers were allowed to return to the gate and await the problem's resolution a two-hour delay on a one-hour flight. Although the crew thanked us for our "incredible patience" no compensation of any kind was offered! Upon arrival in Portland I sought out a gate agent requesting compensation. She helpfully offered me a $50 travel voucher or 2000 mileage plan credit. The moral of this story-always ask for compensation even if not offered up front.

### Alaska Airlines customer review
Due to booking a flight with Delta which sold the seats on Alaska beware. Alaska does not honour your original seats even though you resubmit and get confirmation of seat assignments. We had bought tickets for row 10 for my wife and I - Alaska decided to leave me in row 10 and at first had my wife in row 22 then row 28 after complaining the lady at the Kiosk put both of us in row 30 - the very rear. They do not seem to care much about customer relations. The flight was OK - on time etc.

### Alaska Airlines customer review
Coming back from Maui to Sacramento we were able to buy a 1st class upgrade for $100 each. It was a pleasure to have the improved room and service of first class. The counter staff at the Maui airport were extremely helpful and courteous. The food and service were great compared to traveling in coach. We feel we had a great value.
