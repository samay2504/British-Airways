### "Extremely bad airline"
Extremely bad airline with bad service. Our flights (both ways round trips) were cancelled and rescheduled couple of time, affecting our travel plan and booked holiday. Our check in luggage were delayed for 2 days as well on arrival of our destination. The worse thing was, the airline knew there is no flight on the subsequent day but informed us the luggages will arrive on the subsequent day, and only told us the luggage will only further delay to 3rd day after we checked on the second day. The airline seems to hold no responsibility on the delay, refusing to send the luggage to our hotel, and we have to arrange taxi (on our expense) to airport to collect our luggage when it arrive on the 3rd day. This is the first time we flew with Himalaya Airlinse, and first time we encountered such unpleasant travel experiences, which spoiled our entire holiday plan. Please do not fly with this airline if you have other choices, especially if you have per-book holiday in Nepal. The risk of flight cancellation and baggages delay is extremely high.

### "The worst airline"
The worst airline. First and last time to choose this airline! Re-schedule, re-schedule again and delay! Food is the worst, tasteless, totally no option to choose from, unlike other low-cost airlines.

### "a horrible unstable airline"
They have delayed both my departure and arrival flights by two days, something I have never seen happen with an airline previously. What a horrible unstable airline, it was a nightmare.

### "shocked at the unprofessional attitude"
Being an Indian, the only way to travel to Saudi Arabia during the COVID times is to spend 14 days in some other country and than travel to Saudi Arabia after Quarantine i had selected Nepal as my Quarantine destination. My company had booked the flight in Himalaya Airways , on the 6th May i reached the airport after the quarantine, while i was waiting in the queue to collect my boarding pass, i was informed i cannot board the flight as this flight is only for Nepal and Saudi Citizens during the Covid times. I was shocked, why was this information not told while my company booked the Flight as during the booking it would have asked for Passport details. I spoke to the Ground staff but they just said u cannot board the plane, I asked them to show where exactly is it mentioned about Nationality they had no idea, they did not respond at all. I am still shocked at the unprofessional attitude of the ground staff. I lost the ticket and my company lost the money.
