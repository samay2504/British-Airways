### "free drinks great snacks"
La Vegas to Burbank. Cheap flight and free drinks great snacks. Great  legroom(I'm 6'2). Lounge in LAS was super nice. No TSA I was put onto another airplane (to shorten the delay) without wifi but plane was supposed to have outlets and wifi. There was a delay but the staff and crew were helpful and informative. The captain even flew a lot faster to shorten the delay. After landing I received an email from JetsuiteX apologizing for the delay and issued me a $50 voucher. JetsuiteX eliminates everything that's wrong with flying. They even tried to fill up the remaining seats on the plane with people on the later flight.
