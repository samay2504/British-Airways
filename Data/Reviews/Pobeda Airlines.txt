### "Disaster customer service"
Never again. Angry staff didn't let me board because of my straps have been hanging from my back pack! Disaster customer service. Lost my conection fly in Istanbul! Disaster!

### "unreasonably small sizes for hand luggage"
Not Verified |  First time flying Pobeda they charged for check-in even though they admitted their online check-in system was broken. Their line was that they would reimburse this after landing but despite countless emails they never did. Decided to give them a second chance and they have unreasonably small sizes for hand luggage, for which they charged a hefty €30.

### "They didn't let me board"
I had valid Russian Visa, plus invitation letter. I come to the airport Bergamo and the they didn't accept me on fly. Because cannot fly for tourism. I try to explain that I have not a "Tourism Visa" but "Guest visa" They didn't let me board. My girlfriend coming from Kursk to Moscow by train  to meet me in airport. She had to go back again.

### "bother you at every leg of the journey"
Terrible airline even by low-cost standards. It all starts from website, where you can't change the currency. Airline is deciding In what currency you'll pay. Carry-on bag limits are very restrictive. Can't get "IATA Cabin OK" bag on board even for extra money. Because of that there are constant bag checks. No, they can't give you the label that your bag is okay size. They need to bother you at every leg of the journey, starting with the first check-in. Going one way I've got the label and bad to measure my bag only once, at check-in. But going back there was no bag label, had to put in that rack 3 times. My bag fits, but doing that is extremely annoying. Seats have no legroom (as expected). Surprisingly, you can get drinking water on board without any problems. Actually, the only thing that is good about Pobeda, is cabin crew. They are very pleasant. 2 flights each way, 4 in total, only pleasant experience. But I want to mention extremely stupid announcements on the plane by, I guess, some comedian. Really hard to tolerate it without earplugs. If the airline would've addressed carry-on restrictions, it would've been a decent low-cost airline. But right now, it's better to avoid, because can't be good with only cabin crew efforts, other teams should do better.

### "problem is baggage allowance"
Moscow to Antalya. I would say I liked flying with Pobeda Airlines. The problem is about baggage allowance. I have spent 5 months in Russia as an exchange student; hence, I needed to take a lot stuff with me. I have flown to Russia with Pegasus Airlines, I had 30kgs of checked baggage and 8kgs of cabin baggage allowance, it was perfectly enough. I experienced no problems. When I was searching for tickets come back to Turkey, I was looking for the most reasonably priced option and came across Pobeda Airlines. It was cheap, baggage allowance was 20kgs, but it was no problem. I have purchased 20kgs more for ~1250 RUB, so was feeling relaxed. A couple of days before the flight, thankfully, one of my friends warned me that in Pobeda flights extra baggage is not added to your standard baggage allowance. These two were separate; hence, you could take one single bag which can be 20kgs at max, and one more bag as the same. I thought it was quite stupid; hence, did not really think it was real. Still, I tried to pack my stuff accordingly. When I reached the airport and checked-in, I realized that was real. I had 4 bags (large travel luggage, small sports bag, one backpack and one laptop case for cabin), and they have told me they could accept only two of these as checked baggage. One bag was around 28kgs and other was 5-6kgs; hence, the total was around 33-34 kgs. However, I had to re-arrange them so these could be at most 20.9 kgs. I have spent 20 mintutes at the desk struggling with my luggage, thrown some cheap clothes and etc. As a result, my large bag was ~20.8 and small bag was 7-8 kgs. Since they couldn't accept any other bag because of the fact I had 2x20kgs (which exactly means 2 BAGS maximum 20kg), I had to fill my backpack with clothes and electronics for cabin, hold my laptop in my arms and throw my laptop case/bag since it was larger than the allowed sizes. I had some problems with my laptop case which is additional to my overall baggage allowance problem. My laptop is a 15.6" regular sized one. The case of it was also not oversized. It had reinforced walls and corners to protect my laptop so it didn't bend. It refused to bend to the stupid rules of Pobeda, so I had to throw it at the airport due to 2-3 centimeters extra. To sum up, do not prefer Pobeda if you're not using exactly same travel luggage bags weighing up top 20kgs.

### "have to pay for anything"
Berlin to Moscow. You have to pay for anything apart from your personal item. That includes your carry-on luggage. Longest queue at check-in I have seen in years as a result of everybody having to pay for carry-on or luggage that was more than 20kg. Aircraft are new and made a good impression. Cabin crew young, good-looking and charmingly helpless. Seat do not recline.

### "read the rules and conditions"
Berlin Tegel to Moscow Vnukovo. The cheapest ticket doesn't include any checked luggage and only a small piece of hand luggage. There's a possibility to buy checked luggage in advance - but no such feature for hand luggage! According to this - a person travelling with, for example, a medium-size backpack, should drop it at check-in. Well - it's OK for a LCC to omit any luggage for the cheapest ticket, but why not to let additionally buying an option for large hand luggage? So, if you're travelling with anything bigger than a purse, it's strongly recommended to buy an item of checked luggage in advance - because at check-in desk this will be very costly. Online check-in is tedious, with lots of advertising (do you want to buy an insurance policy? to assign a seat? etc..) One needs to visit the check-in desk for dropping big hand luggage off, for visa check - so a very long queue occurred. Surprisingly, but currently they don't coerce passengers to online check-in as it used to be some months ago - it's also free at check-in desk, but they also accept mobile boarding passes. Tegel terminal C, disorganized, with enormous queues anywhere - is a real nightmare, but that's not Pobeda's fault. They don't provide any meal service onboard, one cannot buy anything, even snacks - some passengers complained on it. Only drinking water is served. However, the aircraft is new and tidy, the seats are acceptable (Ryanair-like), though not reclining, the ground and cabin crew are polite and helpful. As for me, there were too much announcements, especially about smoking prohibition - this was repeated more than 5 times. Usually the flights are punctual, but this time we had a small delay (30 min), due to heavy traffic at VKO, I guess. Generally - for such a price the product is absolutely acceptable. The only recommendation - before the flight read the rules and conditions carefully, in order not to goof.

### "Staff were impolite to me"
Moscow to Irkutsk. Staff were impolite to me at Moscow Vnukovo airport at check-in and at boarding the plane. The nicety at measuring the size of hand luggage is aimed exclusively at extracting additional money from the client, even for 1 cm over the norms.

### "attendant said gate closed"
Moscow Vnukovo to Murmansk. When we reached the check-in desk, the attendant initially asked us to pay 6000 rubles to allow baggage for check. We asked her for the reason to deny check-in and also tried to convince her by saying we have paid for 4 but carrying only 2 bags. Still, she declined to check-in the luggage as they have only 15 to close the check-in and told us "if you want, you can carry your luggage till the boarding point and pay the extra 6000 rubles if you still want to travel". Without any option, we carried our luggage through security check and to the boarding gate. At the boarding gate with 10 minutes left to board the flight. However, the attendant  said gate closed. We were clueless what to do when we were denied for boarding. Then, we went through the other boarding gates and one of the crew from other airlines advised us to go back to ticket counters and check with Pobeda. We strolled our luggage and went to 1st floor to pobeda office. When inquired about our flight, staff mentioned that that was the only flight for that day and the next flight is for same time on next day. 14600 rubles was the fare we paid for the flight and they were unable to adjust us to the next flight with an answer "it is a non refundable ticket". When we tried to book for the same day, the fare was 28600 rubles and the next flight is from Domodedovo airport at 10 pm (3 hours time left). We booked the ticket and rushed to other airport through the traffic

### "take any other airline"
Istanbul to Moscow. Awful, terrible. Rude employees and they ask 45euros for a normal cabin luggage! Nether fly with them anymore. Better take any other airline.

### "Luggage not included in my ticket"
Sochi to St Petersburg. Terrible customer service, employees rude and unhelpful to me. Luggage not included in my ticket (35,000 rubels per bag). Even carry on small luggage bags were paid (30,000 rubels at the gate). 100,000 rubels total for baggage. Recommend not to fly Pobedo Airlines.

### "made me pay that 25 euro fee"
Larnaca to Moscow. It was not possible for me to purchase any food or drinks on the plane, because they  didn't serve anything except for water on a 4 hour international flight. They  charge a fee if a passenger doesn't check in online prior to coming to the airport.It is written somewhere in their policy, and no notification was made to me about such costs on the confirmation email, itinerary, or ticket itself. In my case it was impossible to check in online in advance because they overbooked tickets and there was no seat for me on the plane. Even though it was impossible for me to check -in in advance online because of the overbooking issue and their error in the system as they called it, they still made me pay that 25 euro fee.

### "the flight has been missed"
Moscow to Baden-Baden. During the check-in there were no separate table for baggage drop off. Therefore, there was one queue for the people who was not registered and for the people who had been already registered. We spent 40 minutes in the queue in order to leave a baggage. According my opinion the number of staff from the air company who were involved in registering passengers was not sufficient at all. We dropped off the baggage nearly at the end of the registration to the flight, ie. it means the only 15 minutes left to go through the customs and etc. As a result the flight has been missed.

### "error on the website"
Moscow to Eindhoven. I tried to register for my flight and I got an error on the website. In the call center, which costs 65 RUR per minute I was not helped. I do not know if I can fly back home tomorrow. This is a company which I fly because the flight is from the nearby airports. I do not care about luggage and food, but I should be able to fly home without paying for call center and being nervous about the need to be there tomorrow.

### "couldn’t check in online"
We bought a fly from Milan to Moscow and return. In Milano, We couldn’t complete the check in online but It was impossible and We need to pay extra 50€. Tomorrow, we will have our travel to return our home and We Couldn’t to complete the check in on line. I suppose that tomorrow we will pay 50€ again.

### "trouble with online check in"
In both my two flights with them, from Milan to Moscow and back I got in trouble with the online check in. First flight was impossible to online check in because their unfunctional web page and at the airport I had to pay 25€ fee. Many passenger got in the same trouble. The staff told me to ask a refund to an e mail addres but still nobody answer me. On the way back I got in trouble on the payment for an added luggage I requested online. Because their website makes my wish to pay unrealized saying some sort of error unspecified occur, even that time the online check in was not possible and I needed to pay at the airport. My demand for refund, another time not answered. Need to say also that the carry on board luggage has no sense, you can barely carry on board a pair of spare shoes because they are already too big. I recommend to avoid use this company, is better pick another one, maybe more expensive, because with pobeda you end to pay more, have a worst flight and waste a lot of time.

### "worst airline I've ever tried"
Istanbul to Moscow. This airline is the worst airline I've ever tried, it was the worst experience. Although the plane is good, it started by the hand luggage and they will make you pay 25 euros if you didn't do online check in. The staff in the airport are rude and close registration one hour before the flight. When we tried to complain to Pobeda office in Vnukovo airport Moscow, we received the same rudeness, and they literally said to me "if you don't like it, don't fly with us again).

### "read all the latest policy"
Cologne to Moscow, If you chose to fly with this airline please read all the latest policy of airline about baggage, online-checking, etc. Otherwise, you may be asked to pay 25€ or more at the airport, or you cannot fly, because airline has changed some rules that you need to pay. This happened to me, and the support of Pobeda are rude and not responsible, although they had no answer to my complaint. Very strict about the size of handbag.. Really really stupid rules.

### "check-in online before 5 hours"
Istanbul to Moscow. If you don’t check-in online before 5 hours from flight, they will charge 25 euro per person. I will never choose this airline. Also, the hostesses were very rude to me.

### "Ridiculous  baggage policy"
Milan to Moscow. Ridiculous cabin baggage policy. Bad service and having to pay extra fees. Service very poor. It looks like bonus of employees is linked to give you any penalties.

### "50 euros for additional 10 kgs"
Not Verified |  St. Petersburg to Rostov-on-Don. Even though the hand luggage is free, you won't be able to bring a bag more than size of a shoe box on the plane (not even a regular backpack would fit). Had to pay additional fees to place my hand luggage in baggage section, which I didn't know before they placed my bag on the belt. Also some of the workers at the check-in were measuring your bag while others didn't, their excuse was that "they would make you pay the fees on the plane anyway". It was also hard to find the information about the allowed weight of the baggage per person (which was 10 kgs). I took it for granted that they allowed 20 kg like other airlines, so I had to pay around 50 euros for the additional 10 kgs. The staff was rude and never answered my questions and never clearly explained what I was paying for. Neither were they allowing payments by credit card. In total, the additional fees were the cost of the ticket itself, so I had to pay twice as much as I expected. If you are trying to save money, fly with a more expensive but good company, because there is no point of flying with this airline for the same price but with a genuinely bad quality. Never going to fly with this airline anymore.

### "pay 25 euro to print the pass"
On 22nd December 2018, I check-in online on their web site for the flight Pisa to Moscow. Immediately after having finished the check-in and being assigned the seat, I have been trying many times to print the boarding pass but the link to open the Pdf document was not operating. and there was no way to print it. at Pisa Airport I had to pay 25 euro extra penalty to print the pass. I am badly surprised about this company.

### "Charged us €75 to check in"
Istanbul to St Petersburg. Charged us €75 to check in, even though we tried multiple times to check in online, but could not. The other €45 in fees, I still don’t know what it was for. Their cabin luggage policy is the most ludicrous thing ever. Nothing over the size of a shoe-box. We travel a lot so we have our luggage nailed - not for them. Couldn’t even get our iPad Pros or laptops in the box. Don't fly them - any saving is not worth the extra stress.

### "pay 25 euro to check in!"
Bergamo to Moscow. For some reason system didn't allow me to check in online and I was advised to do it at the airport. When arrived to airport had to pay 25 euro to check in! I was of course told that I should have done it online and my explanations were dismissed.

### "never fly with this airline again"
Not Verified |  St Petersburg to Istanbul. Tried to check-in 4.5 hours before flight, but the website gave an error. Went to the airport, where we were charged 25 euros each for not checking-in online (which is 30 percent of the ticket price!). The atmosphere was really aggressive at the counter since a lot of customers were not informed about this policy. Our luggage was checked for multiple times on size. Would prefer to never fly with this airline again.

### "nonsense hand baggage policy"
Milan to Moscow Vnukovo. Cunning company that applies a nonsense hand baggage policy charging a fee higher than the cost of the ticket. I made a complaint and the response was purely copy and paste. Totally unprofessional, will never fly anymore. Other companies have same prices and, at least, normal service.

### "flight was very delayed"
Krasnodar to Saint Petersburg than from Saint Petersburg to London and from London to Glasgow. From Saint Petersburg till end I must use Pobeda airlines. But because of weather in Krasnodar flight was very delayed. It means I was late to my next flight with Pobeda airlines to UK. When finally I came to Saint Petersburg I tried to reach office to Pobeda for Exchange my tickets. As tickets already was paid and because of weather was not my mistake that I late. But in Pobeda office in Saint Petersburg airport was open light but none open door for me. Than I didn’t had any other choice how to buy new ticket to I’m with another company for same date. Than when I did request for refund my money from Pobeda airlines they Told it’s not them problem and none gave me money back. I had very sad mood and really broken vacations plus money spends for nothing. I’ll never again buy tickets from this company and will suggest to all other people be aware from Pobeda.

### "exceeded expectations"
Stansted to St Petersburg. Overall very fluid experience, definitely exceeded expectations. Being someone who lives in the UK who flies regularly to Europe for weekend breaks, I'm no stranger to low cost carriers by the likes of Ryanair and Easyjet, this week I decided to try out Pobeda's new route from London to St Petersburg, and I was genuinely surprised by its efficiency and overall value. Flying direct to Russia in the past usually meant going on Aeroflot or British Airways, both which offer pretty average service and almost always cost upwards of £150 return, for £50 return on most days Pobeda makes flying on this route much more attractive for tourists like me. A bit of a hack but if you're booking directly from their website, always search in Rubles instead of Pounds/Euros/Dollar as not sure why but the difference in price is quite significant (even including all the exchange fees your bank might charge). Anyways since I was flying from outside Russia, much like other low cost carriers, online check in was a must if you wanted to avoid paying extra. This took less than a few minutes after which I loaded my boarding pass onto my phone. At the airport, having no checked bags, I walked straight to the security checks, and 10 minutes later I was at the gate waiting to board, While boarding a noticed several passengers repacking their stuff, so they are definitely strict with their bag policy. In short, you are only allowed to bring one handbag or backpack with you on board; anything larger than the dimensions described when booking such as suitcases, camping bags or duffel bags must be checked in. This is a tad less but not too different from other low cost carriers as of November 2018. Checked baggage is priced reasonably if prebooked; £9 each bag each way for 10kg and £11 for 20kg. Because of the restrictive bag policy, boarding was insanely fast as passengers no longer had to fight for overhead space. On board, the legroom was decent, better than some low cost carriers such as Wizz Air but for sure no worse than most, and much like the rest, it did not recline, which was fine as I was flying during the day. The plane was also brand new and the cabin was very clean. Food was however unavailable on board, which was a little disappointing, though you are welcome to bring your own food, and water is served for free. By the time we landed in St Petersburg to my surprise we were half an hour ahead of schedule, and it didn't take much longer before we were past immigration and outside the airport. One of the best flights I've had with a low cost carrier, quick and efficient and didn't encounter any problems at all. As with all low cost carriers, as long as you pay attention to the bag policy and remember to check in online when flying from outside Russia, you shouldn't have any issues, very good value for the amount you pay.

### "first and last time to fly Pobeda"
Istanbul to Moscow. Pobeda supposedly started their online checkin procedure several days ago (today is 30 October 2018). Only problem - it doesn't work. I arrived at the airport today to find it was "my fault", and the fault of every other Pobeda passenger at the check in. Due our "fault" we all had to pay 25Euro check-in fees, but they only take Turkish Lira for credit cards at their cashier. They then charged 200 Turkish Lira (32 Euro), but said that if we go file a complaint "in person" at a Pobeda office in Moscow, they will reimburse us (25 Euro). No apologies at all. This was my first and last time to fly Pobeda. I flew Pobeda from Moscow to Istanbul 5 days ago. While it was not chaotic, their customer service was poor. None of the seats recline. If you pay more to board early, they simply let you board the bus to the airplane first; you don't get to the airplane any more quickly!

### "the worst customer service"
Stansted to St Petersburgh via Moscow. Pobeda cancelled my flight back from Moscow for my trip in October 2018 without giving me a reason despite me asking why it was cancelled. I had already incurred visa and hotel costs based on them providing an acceptable service therefore a refund was not acceptable. I can also not take a refund and book another flight as I booked well in advance and flights are now 4-5 times the price. I also cannot travel on another day as my visa expires and I have important plans the day before. Compensation is also not an option as apparently I would have to send a letter in the post to Russia and wait for a reply in the post. Knowing the time it takes to post things to and from Russia, and the time it takes Pobeda to handle even the simplest requests I would be lucky to hear back from them before Christmas. Therefore I asked them to find a flight for me provided by one of their other group members as any other respectable airline would and eventually after multiple expensive phone calls they reluctantly put the request through. Aeroflot has multiple flights on that day available. However after 10 days I have received no updates. Figuring that 10 days was more than enough time to process such a simple request I rang them once again to find out what was happening. They could still not tell me why the flight was cancelled and apparently it was impossible to find out what was happening with the request or how long it would take. When I asked to speak to someone who could sort the situation out, as their call centre was useless, they promptly hung up on me. I then contacted Aeroflot about the situation and they were quick to deny any liability as Pobeda "is not their problem", despite it being their direct subsidiary. I couldn't possibly imagine receiving that response if I rang Lufthansa up with a complaint about Eurowings for example. This has been the worst customer service I have ever experienced.

### "bring people to the bus far too early"
Travelling by Pobeda from Moscow Vnukovo to Krasnodar on Sep 15th. Vnukovo Airport is easy and comfortable. This is also the main hub of Pobeda. Pobeda, being a lowcoster, does not use jetways and they bring the passengers to the plane by bus. No problem with if it is managed professionally. I was boarding the bus at 16:05 (not the first one) and leaving the bus to board the plane at about 16:45. So rather than efficiently managing the boarding, they simply bring people to the bus far too early and let the passengers to wait there for next 40 min. (or more). As you know, there is a very limited number of seats in airport buses. In an overcrowded bus there were elderly people and mothers with a small kids standing all that time and waiting. Pobeda, by managing the boarding in this way, demonstrates its unfriendly customer attitude. They clearly missed the fact that the whole experience from the flight does not start when boarding the plane and when leaving the plane.

### "it is the worst airline"
Cologne to St Petersburgh. Starting with my booking some weeks ago the experience was quite normal, booked a cheap flight with a low-cost carrier. After reading the baggage allowance, I noticed I must pay an additional fee to take my trolley with me up to 10kg, everything was fine. Some days before my flight, I wanted to check-in online to save time at the airport. It was time for the first surprise, online check-in was only available for flight departing from VKO in Moscow. Okay never mind so I took a train earlier and arrived two hours before at the airport. There was already the big queue because only three desks were opened. I was wondering what all people doing with this blue “bagsizers”, how they call it. The carry-on item is only allowed to be 36x30x27cm, if the item is only one cm bigger, you must pay. Yes, for them it is not longer a fee they changed the wording to “punishment”, fair enough. The check in agent was very unfriendly and does not say anything like: “Have a good flight”, etc. There were just waiting for possibilities to punish you with an additional fee. Walking to the gate, I checked Flightradar and saw that our airplane is at least thirty minutes delayed. No information, nothing! Boarding was planned at 18:30 and surprise, the boarding call started at 18:30, I was wondering how it is possible to board if the airplane has not even landed. Again the information if your hand luggage and Duty Free Item does not fit in the “bagsizer” you have to pay a punishment of 30,-€ and of course it was again checked, because your bag may have increased while shopping in the airport. After boarding you were squeezed in a very small part at the airport and waiting for the airplane, so you had to stand one hour until boarding via bus started. And there was no information at all, old people, family with children etc. had to stand one hour queued. Finally, we reached the aircraft, at least it was a modern aircraft, again unfriendly staff guided you to boarding as fast as possible. Again, an information for you, take the seat on your boarding pass, even if there are free seats, if you changed the seat it was time for - exactly! Another punishment. No seat pockets are usual in low-cost carriers, no problem at all but I was wondering where the menu card is? Maybe they handle them after departure to the passengers. After the seatbelt signs were switched off the flight attendants distributed their inflight magazine, but it wasn’t more than an advertising paper. Some experienced passengers began to call the flight attendants, because if you press the Call Button they will bring you a small glass with water free of charge. But there was no Board Bistro, Board Shop, nothing. So, if you did not take anything with you, you may fly hungry or thirsty. Strange business policy, normally low-cost carrier earn money buy selling products on board. But Pobeda airlines policy is to punish you as most as possible. For me it was the first and last time flying that airline, for me it is the worst airline in the world.

### "worst experience possible"
Moscow to Milan. I am used flying low cost companies in Europe and Asia, but had the worst experience possible with Pobeda. I had a small backpack only with my headphone, a computer and a jacket and it could not fit in the cabin baggage size. I was forced to pay for my backpack, but after this, they did not checked in my bag because they were out of time!! So I paid to take the bag with me. The staff is unfriendly and can not speak English, even for the World Cup. I will never fly this company again.

### "never flown one as bad as this"
Samara to Moscow. I've flown a lot of budget airlines in my life, but I've never flown one as bad as this. At check-in we were told to put our cabin bag into a metal container to see whether it fit the cabin bag policy. It did, fantastic. Not our first time on a budget airline as we made sure ours was compliant. But then the our check-in person tried to close a lid on our bag! At first we were a bit confused, then we we realised that our Ryanair/Easyjet/Air Asia cabin sized bag had to fit into this tiny box (I've attached some pictures) which I honestly doubt a standard sized knapsack could fit into. We then realised we weren't alone in complaining about this. The staff were unsurprisingly unhelpful and told us it was in the T&C's. After much scrolling, we found it and by the way, it's not obvious. The only suggestion was the stated dimensions of the hand luggage which gave it way. Hence, we and essentially 95% of the flight had to march to the office on another floor to purchase check-in luggage allowance. If you want to limit cabin luggage to tiny dimensions, make it explicit so consumers can make an informed choice. Fellow travellers, don't make my mistake.

### "an unfriendly airline"
. Flying from Moscow to St.Petersburg on May 7th. My first Pobeda experience, but flying regularly with EasyJet, Ryanair and WizzAir. Compare to those Pobeda seems to be a bit too much low cost (in terms of service). The boarding started on time and then waiting 30 min in the bus (not a nice experience at 6 am). Seats do not have even any seat pocket so you have to keep your newspapers (or anything else) on your knees. I felt that except of the compulsory safety procedure the main purpose of the cabin crew is to make sure no one is asking for anything. Absolutely no service offered and no presence in the cabin during the flight. Price not that attractive given the service. Flight was on time. Overall, an unfriendly airline.

### "judgment is more than awful"
Moscow Vnukovo to Milano Bergamo. I flew with Pobeda today. I bought an access to business lounge at Vnukovo Airport and this lounge was not existing (or nobody at the airport know something about it). Priority boarding was not called and a great confusion was generated at the boarding desk. The inflight experience was less than a standard low cost, the cabin was dirty and the seat doesn't have any pocket to stow a book. A terrible experience, in the end my final judgment is more than awful.

### "worst airline I flew"
Moscow to Sochi. This is the worst airline I flew! It is hard to buy a ticket without making a mistake. They offer you a different day. You have to be careful before confirming a ticket. You have to pay extra even if you carry notebook. Not possible to call them for free.

### "over-met all my expectations"
I have had many experiences commuting between Germany and Russia for the past 20 years. Yesterday I finally made my maiden flight with Pobeda Airlines. I purchased most of the options offered by Pobeda such as XL legroom (Row 15), Priority Boarding, Cabin Baggage etc. The final price with all the Extras incl. Credit Card charges was about 14.000 RUB or 240 EUR within less than 24 hours prior to departure which is quite close to the cheapest Aeroflot Y-class fare if booked one week in advance. (The next day flight for the same route was about 4.000 RUB / less than 100 EUR by the way!) in general, Pobeda met and even over-met all my expectations. Booking was easy and less time consuming than most of the airlines I have traveled before, Check-in agent (AHS) provided fairly good service (three counters open), Gate D40 (terminal position, bridged) dedicated to DP at CGN airport is right in the middle of T2 with two integrated immigration control counters. One minus - gate is a bit small to accommodate 189 PAX with no snack / beverage service or vendor machine. I purchased optional Priority Boarding in advanced, but finally decided to board with last passengers (189 in total, 100% load factor) in order to check capacity of the overhead bins to accommodate all the hand luggage - surprisingly there were more than enough space for all 189 passengers personal belongings. Inflight crew did really an excellent job to get all the passengers satisfied. All four girls served all three hours of flight time long with no interruption providing water, helping passenger with infants, etc. Seats are slim and very comfortable. I used to travel Aeroflot business class for the past 7 years, and my impression was that my Pobeda XL seat at Row 15 provided slightly more space that Aeroflot's business class. Deboarding at VKO was really fast over the front and rear doors. All in all - I would definitely recommend Pobeda to all my friends/colleagues.

### "very good low-cost airline"
Moscow to Cheboksary with Pobeda Airlines. The price was around £50 return ticket + £25 for an extra hand luggage. Pobeda's website was excellent for booking tickets, and what I liked was that all fees and charges were communicated in a very clear and user-friendly way. Check-in at Moscow VKO was done effectively, in a friendly manner. At Cheboksary the check-in was a bit messy, as airport was very small, though still fast and friendly. The planes on both legs were new Boeing 737-800's. Although seats did not recline, legroom was fine. No food was served during flights, but FA offered water at any call. Staff was all about speed and efficiency and were very good at it. All in all, a very good low-cost airline.
