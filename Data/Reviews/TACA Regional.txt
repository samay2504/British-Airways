Round trip from Guatemala to Roatan via San Pedro Sula and Tegucigalpa respectively. June 17-20. For all 1 hour flying segments service was exemplary lunch box on every flight with delicious sandwiches. On the way back departing Roatan plane was intensively checked for an oil leakage threatening our connection at Tegucigalpa with passengers getting nervous about the situation but TACA agent in the waiting room was reassuring! Even offered a free phone call to Guatemala. The plane got fix and we landed just in time in Tegucigalpa with TACA personnel waiting for us at the door of the plane with umbrellas over the tarmac to get to the other plane. When we landed in Guatemala all luggage arrived too! Great service from all the involved staff at all the airports and flights.

BDT to PAC. Flights leave late both on outbound and inbound! The ATR plane was new and well kept the crew were not well dressed. Onboard service basic for 1 hours flight! Would fly them again if Air Panama or Copa are not available.

Don't fly Islena in Honduras if you can fly Sosa instead. We flew Islena from San Pedro Sula to Roatan via La Ceiba. When we arrived in La Ceiba we watched our plane being towed away and were not told anything. Our 20 minute layover exceeded 2 hours. At no time were we told anything by Islena staff. There were no staff members to help us and we were restricted to a room without food or drink. Exactly one week later we were delayed in Roatan for over 3 hours without any explanation. Occasionally an announcement was made in Spanish that said the plane was coming "soon". We know they were lying because the flight time from La Ceiba to Roatan is only 15 minutes. In the meantime the Sosa planes came and went.
