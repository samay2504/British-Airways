### "this was a good flight"
Not Verified |  We flew Virgin Australia for the very first time. The check-in was very good as there were ground staff who helped us for Kiosk check-in and loading the luggage. The aircraft was OK and the seat was quite comfortable. The cabin staff were friendly and professional. There was no meal or drink served as this was low cost airline. We arrived on time. Overall this was a good flight.

### “lack of care, professionalism, and empathy”
Avoid Virgin Australia If You’re Traveling with a Baby Under Two. I strongly advise parents of lap infants under two years old to avoid traveling with Virgin Australia, especially on long-haul flights. Our recent experience with the airline was not only disappointing but deeply upsetting due to their lack of care, professionalism, and empathy towards families traveling with young children. Despite paying extra for seating arrangements that would offer more comfort for both myself and my baby, Virgin Australia failed us—not once, but on three consecutive flights. The airline’s crew demonstrated a troubling level of indifference, poor planning, and, at times, outright disregard for the wellbeing of infants and their caregiver. Flight 1: Perth to Sydney (VA550, 11/04/2025) We were seated in the very last row (Row 30), typically used for crew storage, right next to the only two toilets on a fully booked Boeing 737-800. The overhead compartments were filled with crew luggage, leaving us no space. Throughout the flight, there was a constant queue for the toilets—5–6 passengers at a time—causing congestion and making it nearly impossible to move, let alone soothe an unsettled baby. When we politely asked to stand briefly in the galley for fresh air, we were denied, despite clear signs of our distress. Flight 2: Sydney to Gold Coast (VA523, 11/04/2025) There was no priority boarding for families with young children. The boarding announcement had been modified to mention only those “requiring assistance”—a vague term that left parents like us struggling. We were made to board via the rear stairs, juggling luggage and a baby in long queues with no support or accommodation. This was easily avoidable and starkly contrasts with the family-friendly approach of other airlines. Flight 3: Melbourne to Perth (VA693, 16/04/2025) This was perhaps the most disheartening leg of our journey. We had paid extra—well in advance—for seats with extra legroom to make the long return flight bearable with a toddler. Without any notice, our seats were reallocated to other passengers without children, and we were refunded only upon boarding. No explanation was given. When my child became upset mid-flight (as children often do), I attempted to calm him at the rear of the plane, away from sleeping passengers. Shockingly, I was told I could neither stand near the toilets nor in the galley. The flight attendant insisted I walk up and down the aisles—clearly disruptive and inconsiderate to other passengers. When I explained we had paid for extra space specifically to avoid this situation, her response was, “We are not responsible for such things.” That level of apathy is simply unacceptable. Throughout these experiences, I was met with a consistent pattern: staff who were untrained, unprepared, and, most troublingly, unmoved by the real struggles of traveling with a baby. These weren’t isolated oversights—they reflected a broader culture that, frankly, sends a clear message to parents: You are not welcome here. Virgin Australia has completely lost my trust. As a previously loyal customer, I regret not noticing how poorly they treat families with young children until now. I would never recommend this airline to any parent traveling with a baby on their lap. If you’re a parent planning air travel, I urge you to consider Qantas instead. Every extra dollar spent is worth the peace of mind when you’re mid-air with a distressed child and need assistance.

### "overall it was a good flight"
Despite a delay of about 30 minutes , overall it was a good flight. Check in was easy, the flight attendants were friendly and efficient and the plane was clean and comfortable. The only free beverage was water, which was no issue on such a short flight .

### “staff were friendly and professional”
I enjoyed the flight. Check in was easy and the plane left on time. The staff were friendly and professional. The seat was very comfortable. The meal was tasty with a very good wine. Although the flight was short, I would have preferred a more substantial meal. Otherwise a very pleasant start to my vacation.

### “a pleasant experience”
Check in was easy, as was boarding. Staff coped well on a flight that was completely full. The departure was punctual and the staff were efficient and helpful. Overall a pleasant experience.

### “staff were friendly and helpful”
I enjoyed the flight. Check in was easy and the plane left on time. The staff were friendly and helpful. Only water, coffee and tea were complimentary which is no issue on such a short flight.

### "Generally pleasant flights"
Return flights to Hobart. Generally pleasant flights in both directions. The process for check-in and bag drop was smooth. Boarding via the rear stairs was orderly, if a bit slow. The crew were friendly and courteous. Baggage collection was quite prompt. The seat's legroom was a bit tight, but OK for a short flight. Disembarkation at Melbourne was slowed down by a crew member having their photo taken with friends who were passengers on the flight.

### "Will never fly Virgin again"
Virgin overbooked our flight from Brisbane to Newcastle. Then said 15 people would need to volunteer to take the next flight ... 8hrs later! They offered $200. travel credit that can only be used with them. When no one volunteered the lady making the announcements put it back on the passengers like it was their fault then announced they would be "randomly" booting people off the flight. We were the unlucky ones. When going to ask what was next the same lady told us she didn't want us anywhere near her and told us to go to their service desk. When discussing the matter at the service desk the staff were completely inflexible to discussions about compensation, only $80 meal vouchers which were not even valid at all places in the airport! Will never fly Virgin again and I hope this can stop as many people as possible.

### “Never ever fly”
Never ever fly on Virgin Australia Airlines, my both Melbourne to Canberra VA 281 (5th Feb 2025) and return Canberra to Melbourne VA 284 (6th Feb 2025) more than 40 mins delay due to seat allocation issue in their system. Unbelievable their system. No Air conditioning, only Fan mode in the 34 degrees outside. My both up and down trip is challenging and bad experience because of Virgin Australia.

### "Overall a great flight"
Although it was busy (Australia Day Public Holiday), check in was quite easy . The plane left on time and staff were efficient and friendly. Only water, coffee and tea is available for free but for a short flight I don't mind. Overall a great flight and a pleasant way to end my Australia Day Break .

### "flight departed on time"
I enjoyed the flight. Check in was easy and the flight departed on time. The staff were friendly and efficient. The seat was comfortable too . Only tea   coffee and water is available free of charge, which is no big deal given it's such a short flight .

### "exceptionally dissatisfying"
Not Verified |  When I flew back from Denpasar Bali to Melbourne on VA94 I asked to be seated in the middle of the aircraft with my friend who came on holiday with myself, I was told this was not possible. Upon entering the plane my friend was seated in the middle of the aircraft whilst I was seated on the second last seat on the right hand at the back. The back seat was reserved for staff members. I was not happy to be seated at the back as the turbulence is felt a lot more, hence why I asked to be seated in the middle. I had mentioned this to the lady at the counter. Secondly, the light was not working on the RHS of the plane, therefore they stayed on throughout the whole flight which was from 2200 until 0640 am. When I asked the Stewardess whether I could have a mask so I can sleep, I was advised that I had to buy the whole pack for $25 which included the blanket and pillow. At no time was there any customer service or an apology for the lights not turning off the whole flight. I found this exceptionally dissatisfying especially since I paid a high premium for my flight. The staff behind me went and slept with their masks on with no care on how I was feeling. I have flown so many times with Virgin Australia and I am not happy with the lack of care or concern that your staff has shown me throughout the flight.

### "customer service is also poor"
Worst airline in Australia. Flew 10 flights with Qantas with no problems whatsoever. The last two flights with Virgin Australia were delayed by 1-2 hours ruining all plans. The customer service is also poor compared to QA. Avoid Virgin Australia if you can!

### "Virgin refuse any compensation"
Not Verified |  Melbourne to Sydney a few months ago. First we were loaded on to one plane, then told we needed to disembark and get on another because of an issue with the plane. We then get on another plane, and taxi out, and for some reason, we wait on the tarmac for hours, until finally told we won't be leaving that night, and we'll have to get a flight next day. We're told Virgin won't book any of us a hotel, but they'll reimburse us (I think it was up to about $120, approx), but when we tried calling hotels, none had vacancies - including none of the hotels near Sydney airport. Having had no success in finding a hotel with a room, and not knowing what else to do, thought we'd go back to the airport, and go to the Virgin desk. Saw some other passengers on the flight who told us to go to the Virgin desk as they were booking people into hotels. So, went back there and they gave us a booking confirmation for a room at a hotel close to the airport. We get a taxi there, and go reception, to find most of the passengers from our flight crowded into reception. Guy at reception seems to have no idea what to do, and there's no clear communication, but it seems that it will be pot luck as to who gets a room. Nowhere else to go, so we wait for hours at reception, until at 3am, we're told we're not going to get a room. So, many of us end up trying to sleep in the reception area, without even access to a toilet. Contact Virgin and they blame hotel. Hotel blames Virgin. Virgin refuse any compensation because we were not 'out of pocket'. Despite the fact that, because we didn't get any room for the night, Virgin did not have to pay the cost of a room.

### "lack of professionalism and empathy"
I recently travelled with Virgin Australia on VA 175 from Brisbane, Australia, to Nadi, Fiji Islands, on 6th January, 2025. Unfortunately, my experience with the cabin crew left much to be desired, particularly regarding their lack of professionalism and empathy. As someone recovering from an illness, I am unable to lift even lightweight items above my shoulders due to medical restrictions. My carry-on luggage weighed less than the allowable 7kg, and I only required minimal assistance to place it in the overhead locker. When I politely requested help from the cabin crew, I was met with a dismissive and unprofessional response. The crew member I approached stated that she was “not insured to put luggage in the lockers” and went on to suggest that I should have checked in my luggage if I couldn’t manage it myself. Her tone was harsh, and the words were unnecessary and unsympathetic. This experience was particularly upsetting, as I expected basic courtesy and support from the staff, who are there to ensure passenger comfort and safety. While I understand there may be certain policies in place regarding assisting passengers, there is a more professional and empathetic way to communicate this. Instead of making me feel like a burden, she could have offered to find an alternative solution, such as asking a colleague or another passenger to assist. As a healthcare worker myself, I would not respond harshly to my patient but rather find a solution to help the needy, even if it demands me to ask for help from someone. This incident not only marred my experience with Virgin Australia but also raised concerns about the training and attitude of the staff towards passengers with special needs or temporary limitations. Cabin crew members should be prepared to assist passengers respectfully and without judgement, particularly in situations where the passenger is physically unable to perform certain tasks. I hope this feedback is taken seriously to improve future passenger experiences. Compassion and professionalism are essential in customer service roles, especially in the aviation industry.

### "A very enjoyable flight"
A very enjoyable flight. The plane departed on time and arrived early. Staff were very friendly and helpful. Only water, tea and coffee were available free but any extra food or drink had to be purchased, which was no issue for a flight of under two hours.

### "very helpful and efficient"
Easy check in and boarding. The plane left on time. The staff were very helpful and efficient .The seat was very comfortable. The food served was quite tasty, but rather small. A pretty paltry main meal with cheese and crackers. The wine served was very good. Apart from the very small meal I had a good flight.

### "poor service getting checked in"
Computers didn't work, only one staff member trying to assist us to check in. Had my seat changed at the gate which moved me away from my family, but they didn't tell me they changed my seat so I went to my original seat and then got told off for being in the wrong seat! Very poor service getting checked in as it took over one hour because computers were not working. Got changed to the last row next to toilet which did not recline!

### "satisfied and good value for money"
Can't tell if Virgin Australia is a low cost or a Legacy carrier, straight forward flight, free luggage, meals are Buy onboard, no seatback IFE but you can download the app and streamed for free which is common nowadays, overall satisfied and good value for money. Aircraft is spotless and has the updated cabin interior.

### "A very enjoyable flight"
A very enjoyable flight. Check in was easy and the plane left on time .Staff very very helpful, friendly and efficient. Food and beverages (apart from coffee tea and water) were for purchase only, which is fine on such a short flight.

### "staff were very friendly"
Despite a very busy morning morning at Melbourne Airport check in went relatively smoothly. Unfortunately there was a delay of over 30 minutes. However the staff were very friendly and helpful which almost made up for it.

### "never flown Virgin without a delay"
The one hour flight was due to depart at 6.35am. That morning notified it was delayed until 8.45am. Nothing new. Have never flown Virgin without a delay. It actually did not leave until 9.10am. Apparently a crew member called in sick and they had to wait for a new crew member to fly from Sydney. No coffee or tea offered, just water. Have flown this route many times and have always had coffee/tea before. Along with the long delay it just made for a further not great flight. I hope they start to step up as they are not looking too great to me.

### "Miserable airline"
Miserable airline. Cancelled the flight with no further information, no rebooking, no assistance, nothing. They require you to call an Australian number from overseas at high costs without even assisting. They had no staff to provide info, wouldn't assist trough Messenger/Whatsapp, just kept referring to call the Australian number. A friend had to call in Australia to hear they would only rebook passengers on a flight 9 days later, with no hotel, f&b vouchers or anything provided. Did not provide a recovery flight like Qantas, no further mails, texts or calls. This is probably one of the most terrible airlines in the world with no respect to customers/passengers. One advice, never fly with them as they are not worth being an airline.

### "Overall a good flight"
Check in was fast and friendly. The plane left on time and the flight attendants were helpful and efficient. Unfortunately the tray table was a bit grubby. Only tea , coffee and water were included. Everything else had to be purchased. It may be a good idea for Virgin to include the option of pre purchased drinks, snacks and meals ; especially for flights leaving at meal times. Overall a good flight

### "I enjoyed my flight"
I enjoyed my flight. Despite the morning crowds , check in was quite easy. The staff were friendly and helpful and the plane left on time .O nly water, tea and coffee were available which was no issue on such a short flight.

### "Very pleasant flight"
Very pleasant flight, arrived on time. Paula was excellent in the business cabin, the meal was better than anticipated, tasty and well presented, wines were acceptable, and the seat was comfortable. This is one of the 737s that still has the divider between business and economy plus, so cabin traffic was minimal. Good value for me at 35,500 Velocity points bought with an Amex Mileage Rewards transfer. This could easily have been my best trans Australia flight, but for one issue. I was inexplicably bumped from my 1A seat (window, bulkhead to 2C aisle, last row of business) after I had checked in while sitting in the lounge. Luckily I spotted it before boarding and the lounge staff managed to undo whatever had been done. It appeared I might have been bumped to accommodate a couple which is apparently not policy. Not appreciated as a single traveller that had booked months ago and selected a seat at that time. I know seats are not guaranteed and can be changed for operational reasons, but two grown ups wanting to sit together is not an operational reason. Priority boarding was a bit of a zoo too with a big queue of people not eligible for priority boarding, but the gate agents did make several announcements so tried their best.

### "Bag was left off plane"
Not Verified | Bag was left off plane. They knew this and in app luggage tracker it stated "bag is with us". No other communication. Went to check in and was pointed to QR Code to fill in. Received email saying they'd be in touch in 2 business days. Called them and told that bag could not make flight and was scheduled onto later flight. An hour after that flight arrived received email it had been rushed onto that flight. Called them again and told we'll contact local team to urgently contact you. That was an hour ago. So basically they'll screw you to convenience themselves and not care a damn on wasting your time.

### "I enjoyed the flight"
I enjoyed the flight. Easy check in, on time departure and friendly and helpful flight attendants. The only items that were free were water, tea and coffee which is no issue for so short a flight.

### "on time departure"
Easy check in and on time departure. Friendly and helpful staff. Apart from tea , coffee and water all food had to be purchased which is ok on such a short flight. Perhaps Virgin could give passengers to prepay meals if they wish ? Overall a very pleasant flight.

### "seat was very comfortable"
A very enjoyable flight. Easy check in and service, friendly and efficient staff and on time departure. The seat was very comfortable for a 2 hour flight .Food and drink were very good, but could have been a bit more substantial; all that was provided for desert was a small chocolate. Overall I was very satisfied.

### "Overall a good experience"
Check in was easy and efficient. There was unfortunately a delay in the departure of the plane (20 minutes) but that was not a big concern. Staff were very pleasant and efficient. Food, apart from tea, coffee and water had to be purchased which is no big deal on such a short flight. Overall a good experience.

### "friendly and efficient staff"
A very enjoyable flight. Easy check in and service, friendly and efficient staff and on time departure. The seat was very comfortable for a 2 hour flight .Food and drink were very good, but could have been a bit more substantial; all that was provided for desert was a small chocolate. Overall I was very satisfied.

### "They ran out of food"
The queue for the toilets stretched all the way down to seat row 15. Meanwhile in business (10 seats in total) they have two toilets between them which we were not allowed to use. They ran out of food on a six hour flight. I was only allowed to order one small bottle of wine! Departure gate changed at the last minute. The gate, either boarding or disembarking, was the furthest away from the main terminal and had to catch a bus on the tarmac to the terminal. WiFi non-existant. You can purchase high-speed WiFi but that will cost an extra $10 per 30 mins. My money will never be going their way again.

### "disgusted by the lack of support and empathy2
I am deeply disappointed with the handling of my rebooking request by Virgin Australia following Rex's announcement of voluntary administration. The experience was marked by incompetence and a lack of empathy, causing significant stress for my legally blind client. Despite submitting the rebooking form promptly on 31st July, I received no confirmation or follow-up. My attempt to email necessary documents for my client's seeing-eye dog was met with a full inbox, and I had to follow up multiple times without adequate support. When I finally spoke to the special assistance line, the agents responses were unhelpful and indifferent. She did not bother to check our bookings or show any concern for my client's specific needs. Even though we eventually rebooked the flights, the process was far from satisfactory. The agent asked unnecessary questions and made unhelpful comments, delaying the process further. My legally blind client deserves better care and consideration. This experience has caused undue stress and anxiety for both of us. I demand immediate action to rectify this situation, including a formal apology and assurance that future travel arrangements for disabled passengers will be handled with the necessary priority and care. Virgin Australia needs to significantly improve their customer service practices, particularly for passengers with disabilities. The current level of support is unacceptable and deeply frustrating. I am utterly disgusted by the lack of support and empathy shown by Virgin Australia and would not recommend their services to anyone, especially those with special needs.

### "don't want to compensate me."
Virgin Australia destroyed my luggage and they don't want to recognize or compensate me. In the same flight, another passenger found the luggage destroyed and also no compensation. I made a written complaint but I ask The original receipt since I bought the luggage plus an accredited witness. I am totally disappointed and I will never use their services again.

### "Beware this airline's cancellation policy"
Beware this airline's cancellation policy. This has always been my airline of choice. Imagine my complete disappointment, when I went through the process of cancelling a flight - made sure it was possible - forfeited $100 for doing so and received an email saying I would receive a $532 travel bank credit. All good that suited me. But when I looked in travel bank there was only $232 credit. Apparently it had to do with using travel bank points which were going to expire - had I known that, I would have transferred dates or kept the flights. Why had this not been conveyed prior to processing the cancellation. I have in writing this airline would refund this amount. A letter to this Airline's complaints department yielded a 'too bad so sad' response. It is completely deceptive for Virgin to not to have disclosed this instead of confirming you would be withholding this amount. So disappointing.

### "a beautiful experience"
Not Verified |   The flight from Melbourne to Maroochydore (VA1029) at 6:40am this morning was a beautiful experience. I need to give a special mention to Hellen and Tarsha. I do not ever recall a time when I was shown a more genuine level of care from any stewardess. They were attentive,  intuitive and checked on me often during the flight.

### "not for unaccompanied minors"
Not Verified |   I definitely would not recommend this airline to anybody, especially not for unaccompanied minors or mothers travelling alone with their kids. I experienced a distinct lack of care and service for myself and my child. I would strongly recommend looking into an alternative airline to travel with if you would like support and care for your child. Please do not book unaccompanied minors on these flights - I had the worst customer service experience ever - cabin crew were unprofessional, rude, callous and immature. I would hate for more children to experience the treatment my child did.

### “Worst customer service experience”
Don't fly with Virgin Australia. Worst customer service experience ever in trying to get a seat allocation. Never wanted to fly with Virgin Australia so booked through Qatar or so I thought. When clicking on the Qatar icon to book my ticket, it unbeknown to me shunted me to Virgin Australia and I paid $ to Virgin Australia and the ticket issued under Virgin Australia. After payment, ticket issues with "Seats check-in required". Fare type entitled me to seat allocation and I am also a frequent flyer member and that also entitled me to seat allocation. When trying to obtain the seat allocation through "Manage my Booking" I was blocked. I emailed Virgin Australia customer care several times and called the 13 67 89 number several times but kept getting stonewalled. I called Qatar several times but whilst they were able to give me the seat allocations, when they tried to put it through their system, it showed that Virgin had put a restriction on the ticket. Virgin refused to listen. A friend had the same problem but lucky for her she knew a virgin staff member who went into the booking and with one click removed the restriction. That staff member could not understand why customer care would not do this. Had to get to the airports more than 3.5 hours prior to flights leaving to try and secure an aisle seat.

### "unprofessional and incompetent"
Not Verified |   This company is unprofessional and incompetent. They have enabled a third party to cancel an international flight in my name and then issued a flight voucher to this person in their name at financial expense. When contacted about it they refuse to act without a police report. Knowing full details of situation and leaving me the customer without a flight ticket and significantly financially out of pocket. What an absolute joke! No accountability for their customer service staffs actions.

### "3/4 flights a month are delayed"
First flight in the morning delayed, last flight of an arvo delayed. The time of the flight doesn’t seem to matter nor does providing reasoning as to why the flight is delayed. If it were a few times it wouldn’t be an issue but 3/4 flights a month are delayed and the last flight isn’t due to it being with a different airline.

### “there was a smell of urine”
Our flight was delayed 45minutes which turned out to be 2 hours. There was no vouchers or allowance to use the virgin lounge even a reluctance to explain the reason which turned out to be staff shortage. When finally boarding the aircraft there was a smell of urine. (The toilets were still being cleaned) My main gripe is if I had been late by 45mins to 2 hours for my flight I would have to had purchased a new ticket. So how is it that airlines are allowed to get away with this?

### "$12 for a sandwich is ridiculous"
I fly Qantas a lot because I know what to expect via service food etc and find that comforting. Every now and then I fly Virgin due to scheduling and sometimes a lower fare due to work, thing is they could be way better than Qantas if they supplied food and beverages like Qantas instead of charging on board, $12 for a sandwich is ridiculous as is all other prices on their menu, they used to provide as part of fare but no more. Makes them feel like a budget European airline, which are just that, budget! As the number 2 airline in Australia they should wear the suit that applies to that level, not Kmart shorts and singlet and things! Would support more if they lifted their game! Nice they tell me my bags are on board though, are you paying attention Qantas. Maybe learn from each other for your customers benefit. As always be safe and Bon voyage

### "fantastic and very professional"
We flew with Virgin Australia from Brisbane to Fiji with return and were lucky enough to have Ryan and the crew both ways, they were fantastic and very professional, they gave our trip the kick start it needed for a great holiday cannot recommend Ryan and crew high enough. Great flight.

### "No sympathy, just refusal"
Not Verified |   Could not fly due to our youngest son being in hospital. Half the total fares were taken in fees and the rest put in travel bank. Fast forward 12 months, with the cost of living ext, we can't afford to fly anywhere, and I have asked for an extension for even 6 months. No sympathy, just refusal. Virgin Australia are holding onto money that is mine.

### “Staff customer service poor”
Not Verified | Staff customer service poor. I was asked by passenger sitting behind me not to recline my seat as he had a baby. I had paid full fare for my seat but had to sit up straight even though I had a neck ache. No meals on the 4 hour flight to Fiji. This is an early morning flight. You will have to buy from their inflight menu or go hungry until the afternoon when you land in Fiji. Be careful when you tap your credit cards for inflight meals. I was overcharged. The flight attendant does not show the screen what you are paying for and no receipt is issued.

### "Thank you to this lovely crew"
I had a problem with my ear after take off from Sydney & my ear started bleeding. Nothing terrible but slightly uncomfortable. I knew there was nothing cabin crew could do to fix my problem & just requested a tissue very discretely. Cabin crew became aware of my discomfort & were very understanding & reassuring I was not an inconvenience requesting a few tissues. Unbeknown to me the cabin crew informed the Pilot who then planned for the flight to descend more slowly so cabin pressure could adjust more gradually. Well this was my limited understanding of the amended flight plan & low & behold it made the descending flight much more comfortable. I’m no expert in anything about flight pressure or anything about flying any sort of aircraft but I am still so amazed that any cabin crew who were already so lovely would then inform their Pilot of such a minor issue & they would do whatever they could to help just one passenger. I was happy with just a tissue & some water! Such kindness goes above & beyond any customer service I have experienced anywhere in my life. I wish I could have thanked the Pilot & his second in charge (unsure of correct terminology I’m sorry) in person & I truly hope this review is brought to their attention because I may not fly to Ballina every week for a funeral (thankfully!) but where ever I do fly next time, I know which airline will be top of my list. Passengers do not forget such acts of kindness & nor do the many other people who hear about this in conversation. Thank you to this lovely crew from Virgin Airlines & they are so fortunate to have staff like you! K

### "couldn't care less"
Garbage airline that couldn't care less about on time performance. Haven't had a single evening flight on time post covid. Putting profits over customers is clearly why they have to keep pushing back IPO attempts.

### “I enjoyed my flight”
I enjoyed my flight. Easy check in and bag drop and on time departure. Staff were very friendly and helpful. The only drinks available for free were water, coffee and tea which is ok given it was a short flight. Baggage collection was fast too.

### "good chance of securing an entire row"
Superb economy class service with very friendly and responsive cabin attendants. Flight departed and arrived on time. Seating was comfortable without being great. A big plus was the device holder and USB (type B) charging port. I purchased the full-flight wi-fi pass for AUD19.95, and it probably worked 90% of the time, and appeared to interfere with the IFE reception at times (a member of the cabin crew advised me that this often was the case on this particular aircraft). However sometimes Wi-Fi coverage can be degraded by the location of the aircraft. When it does work, it's good. Catering is what we've come to expect on VA: all user-pays, and OK in terms of choice and quality. Please note that VA have no lounge in Haneda or Cairns. That can be managed in Haneda as there is plenty to keep you occupied, but it is a problem in Cairns International, which is little more than an oversized bus shelter. This flight, and its return flight (VA78) are rarely at full capacity. Choose your seats carefully, and you have a good chance of securing an entire row to yourself!

### "very comfortable seat"
Check in was easy and the flight left on time. A very comfortable seat. Food, service and wine served was excellent. Some extra snacks were offered which was nice. Quick collection of baggage as well. All in all a wonderful flight

### "I enjoyed the flight"
I enjoyed the flight. Easy check in, friendly staff and on time departure. A very tasty meal as well. Perhaps desert could be a bit more substantial. Lovely wine served too.

### "not impressed with the service in Perth"
Not Verified |   I flew to Darwin at 18 March and needed some assistance departing. A nice lady behjnd the business class desk immedjately got a wheelchair for me and took me through customs, that was excellent service and so was the whole flight.when we arrived they ordered a lift for me, I did not have to use the stairs, there was another lady that also wanted to cone down in the lift. Her daughter wited for her down the stairs. Virgin ordered from Perth a wheelchair for me in Darwin. To my surprise the daughter picked the wheelchair and put her mother in 'my' chair and I had to walk the Iong istne with my walking stick. Not so nice . But going back home 30 March virgin had a wheelchair for me again and also in Perth which was fantastic. A young girl from the ground staff in Perthrolled the whelchair through maybe 1/3 of the trip to thd luckage and left me there, she took off and I was really very angry, sat there. Everything was closed,nmmand I was there all alone in a wheelchair, I got out and walked all the long way with my walking stick and handbag and travelbag. That was the bad service at Perth Airport! Virgin was good but I'm not impressed with the service in Perth. It was extremely rude.

### "unhappy with the way we were treated"
Not Verified |  We were subjected to a delay that interrupted our onward travel. Due to the delay of the flight out of Hobart, we missed our onward flight from Fiji Airways to Nadi, FJ934. We were also very unhappy with the way we were treated, and we were not kept notified of what was happening. There were no status notifications announced that we were able to hear, any announcements were spoken so rapidly and unclearly that we couldn't understand a word said. We only saw people finally boarding, so went to the gate and jumped on board after over an hour delay, with no information. There was one flight attendant who was very helpful (I wish I knew her name), but others were brusque and rude. We talked to the helpful attendant in flight, and asked if they would make an announcement to request that people remain seated to allow those with close connections to deplane first, but apparently the captain refused the request, as it was never made. There was no communication from the cockpit, and that bothered me, as I like to hear what the weather and landing is expected, it helps reassure me, as a nervous flier, that the Captain has things well in hand. Also, it seemed a rough and scary landing, even though the weather was clear and not very windy, as far as I know. All in all, a very bad experience, and the gate for our Fiji flight was closed by they time we made it there. As a result, we had to spend the night in Melbourne and had hotel, dinner and breakfast expenses. We asked for some compensation for our rude treatment and delay resulting in increased expenses, but this was again, rudely denied.

### "Overall a good flight"
Check in was easy with friendly and efficient staff. The departure was a little delayed, but this was no big issue. The staff were very friendly and helpful. The seat was quite comfortable and baggage collection fairly prompt. Overall a good flight.

### "it was a good flight"
Unfortunately my flight was cancelled, which was a bit annoying. at least I was informed the night before and was able to choose a flight at about the same time. Check in was a bit haphazard. It was hard to find the right queue. Otherwise it was a good flight ; good cre , on time departure and quick pick up of baggage.

### "staff were friendly"
A very enjoyable flight. Easy check in, the flight left on time and staff were friendly and well organised. The flight left right on time. My only minor issue was that baggage collection was a bit slow.

### "a great travel experience"
I arrived early and was given the option of leaving on a flight 1 hour earlier. Easy check in, friendly and helpful staff and the plane departed on time. Only water, coffee and tea is available for free which is no issue on such a short flight. Thanks for a great travel experience.

### " Staff were very friendly and helpful"
Check in was easy. Unfortunately the flight was delayed by over an hour - it could have been worse. Staff were very friendly and helpful. The only beverages offered for free were tea, coffee and water. All other drinks and food had to be purchased. This was no issue as it was a very short flight. Once I arrived in Melbourne baggage collection was very prompt.

### "I enjoyed the flight"
I enjoyed the flight. The departure was on time, check in was easy and the staff were most friendly and helpful. The only free food and drink available was water, coffee and tea, which is no issue on such a short flight. Perhaps Virgin should also offer passengers the chance to pre purchase meals as Jetstar does. This would be particularly useful on longer flights.

### "Virgin seems like the new Jetstar"
First flight taken since COVID. Virgin seems like the new Jetstar. Flight was 2 hours late taking off and most of that 2 hours was spent sitting on the tarmac with announcements made by pilot that they were waiting for the final sign off from engineers. It was hot and we were travelling with our 83 and 92 year old parents. No water was offered during this time. They were starting to feel unwell. We were towards the back of the plane and no meal items left by the time the food trolley reached us. Not the fault of any of the staff but we had anticipated arriving in Brisbane by 1pm and having lunch there but instead we hadn’t even taken off. Not a great start to our holiday.

### "Good luck to the new CEO"
Not Verified | Horrendous, international 8 hour leg with no food and all the drinks ran out (alcoholic and non-alcoholic) about 3/4 across to Tokyo. No inflight entertainment, no pre-purchase comfort options, this carrier is operating somewhere between low cost carrier and Bobs back country bogan general aviation charter business. Good luck to the new CEO, she won’t be getting paid from my hard earned being spent on tickets ever again.

### "customer service is non existent"
A long time user of this airline, 20 years. Historically, they have been fine. This time the problem was with the ground staff, and their handling of the matter. Their policy change meant my normal travel with items were taken away, value over $200 Aud. A pain, but not a big deal. During this process I was ridiculed by a member of staff, and promised follow up emails from manager. Since hearing nothing from the manager, I escalated the matter. Virgin Australia simply blank and ignore my emails and phone calls, their customer service is non existent, even at higher levels when the matter is escalated. It appears the company does not care about the service they are providing. People are now increasingly looking for decent, at a bare minimum, customer service, so with the above situation I cannot recommend Virgin Australia. My next domestic flights are booked with Qantas as a consequence.

### “staff very friendly and efficient”
A pleasant way to end my stay in Sydney. The FF flight left on time, check in was easy, the plane was clean and well maintained and the staff very friendly and efficient. Only coffee, tea and water were included, which is no problem for such a short flight. Food was available for purchase. It would be great if Virgin gave passengers the opportunity to pre purchase meals. This would be especially worthwhile for flights departing at lunch and dinner.

### “A functional flight”
Not Verified | A functional flight. Full so not much room. Complimentary tea, coffee and water is provided Ground staff were helpful, encouraging us to reduce the weight of one suitcase to avoid a fee. Baggage collection was a breeze at Launceston.

### “the staff were friendly”
I booked the flight and was given the option to take an earlier flight. Unfortunately this flight was delayed by an hour! On the positive side, check in was easy, the staff were friendly and the aircraft was clean.

### “My whole long weekend was ruined”
Even though Virgin Australia sounds reputed, this is the worst experience I had. Came to Sydney airport to fly to Melbourne on 25th Jan and flight got cancelled. They gave me another one on next day 11.30am. Then received a message saying it is delayed. Came airport, flight is cancelled again. Went to service desk, all they had to say was “we apologize and there is nothing else we can do”. My whole long weekend was ruined thanks to Virgin Australia

### “staff were very friendly and helpful”
Unfortunately A my flight was cancelled and B the flight that I was transferred to was delayed by nearly 30 minutes. That said, I still enjoyed my flight. I was given plenty of notice regarding my flight changes and check in was easy. The staff were very friendly and helpful as well.

### “I enjoyed the flight”
I enjoyed the flight. Easy check in, punctual departure, friendly and efficient staff. The plane was comfortable and clean. The only refreshments included were water, tea and coffee which was no problem on such a short flight.

### "Overall a good flight"
Easy check in and very friendly service. Very nice white wine but it could have been colder. The meal was quite tasty, but a bit small. Dessert was a small chocolate. Overall a good flight.

### "clearly the worst performer"
Have flown an array of airlines in 2024. Virgin clearly the worst performer from all aspects. Luggage policy, helpfulness of staff. Reliability (8 virgin flights in 2023 with 3 cancelled, 4 delayed).

### "will never fly with them again"
Avoid like crazy! We had credit from Covid and were finally able to use it (As VA weren't even flying to our country until recently - NZ). Had a trip in Australia so were finally able to use them. Then they cancel our return flight last minute forcing us to quickly have to book on Qantas and give us a partial refund (a third of the fare), and the rest credited again to the travel bank. They have then given us only three months to book and use this credit before it expires forever. Tried to come to a compromise as we're planning to be back in Australia again mid next year, however they refused to let us use the credits despite us not being able to travel the last few months and they don't even fly to anywhere near us. I've tried and tried to work with them, but definitely will never fly with them again.

### “enjoyed the flight”
I enjoyed the flight. Easy check in, punctual departure and friendly staff. Only water and coffee and tea is provided free of charge, which is OK, given it's a short flight.

### “Flight attendants efficient and friendly”
Check in was easy. Friendly staff. The plane left on time. The seat was quite comfortable. Flight attendants were very efficient and friendly. Only water, tea and coffee was free, which is OK for such a short flight. I didn't have to wait long to pick up my bags in Melbourne. Overall a nice flight.

### "it's unprofessional, embarrassing"
Not Verified |  They cancelled my 7 am flight and put me on an earlier one at 6am. With the alert coming in via email at midnight so I didn't receive it until waking up (too late by then as I need over an hour to get to the airport) - started driving to the airport anyway and called the customer care desk to ask if I could still board the new flight if I only arrived 40m prior to departure. He was very rude and did not understand what we were asking. Inevitably, I missed the flight which was connected to Fiji, so I obviously also missed my Fiji flight in Melbourne. He eventually rebooked me for the following day, no refund for the missed flight cos it was "my fault I couldn't make it" to the new flight I never confirmed. He charged $1400 for the new one way ticket (I paid $500 for the one I had to miss) so that's $1800 total and a day less in Fiji. I confirmed the new flight on the phone and via email confirmation whilst on the phone, to then receive my e-ticket an hour later with a completely different flight on it. Had to call back a second time. I was told the flight he'd booked "didn't exist". It did, I had it up on my phone, it was just through a completely different airline. So they had to change my flight again. I then realised they hadn't given me access to select my seats. I paid extra money on both my initial flights (before they cancelled) yet they were only allowing me to select standard seats. - I called a third time to confirm my seating, specifically asking for the 2 window seats I'd already paid for. The lady said that was ok and confirmed on her end and that she would resend an updated e-ticked. - an hour later I didn't have the confirmation email so I checked my booking. She had not changed my seats at all. In fact, the ones I selected were not taken by other people, so I had to call for a fourth time to say that my seats had in fact not been changed and now I don't even have the option anymore. I hate to say this, but the staff I spoke to across all 4 phone calls today we're very incompetent to the point that it's unprofessional, embarrassing and truly takes away the fun in travelling. Cancelling a flight last minute, rebooking me on an earlier one at such short notice in the middle of the night, then rebooking on a non-existent flight, then saying my seats are changed but not actually changing them. How is this even possible. I've had to cancel multiple things in Fiji because I won't be there until tomorrow now (transfers, accommodation etc).

### "cancelled my flight last minute"
Virgin Australia cancelled my flight last minute from 8 am to 8pm. I was only going away for two days and it means I will miss important events in Brisbane. I called the call centre at 5:30 am and an automated message said it was closed till 5 am, so it should have been open. The people I was travelling with were able to continue on that flight but my booking was cancelled for no real reason. When I rebooked my flight it wouldn’t let me check in. They were also texting other passengers my booking details. My friend was travelling with Virgin but on a different flight that day (we booked separately) was getting texts with my booking details. These texts included my name, number, email and boarding details which is a huge breach of privacy. It makes me concerned how many others were texted my details that I am not even aware of.

### "Flight home was cancelled"
Not Verified |  Flight home was cancelled on 11/11, I had no notification. Was offered no explanation at airport and no assistance. Was rescheduled to 2 days later, at 6.30 am - so frustrating. I had no extra medication with me and it impacted commitments I had back in Adelaide. Not happy.

### "cancelled our flight without proper reason"
Not Verified |  They cancelled our flight without proper reason, which caused our international flight to be missed. The ground staff service is terrible. They did not offer proper hotel and no meal compensation, nor re-organized our international connection flights. The Adelaide airport staff service is the worst we have ever experienced. Will never fly Virgin again.

### "Overall a decent flight"
Unfortunately the flight was delayed by nearly an hour. A pity. Otherwise it was an enjoyable flight. Easy check in, friendly staff and a comfortable seat. Food as on all Virgin Australia Economy Flights, had to be purchased, apart from water, coffee and tea. Overall a decent flight. A shame about the delay.

### "Staff very friendly and helpful"
An enjoyable flight. Check in was easy and the flight left on time. Staff were very friendly and helpful. The seat was comfortable for such a short flight. The snack options were limited. Only free water coffee and tea. The rest had to be purchased. But that is no issue for such a short flight .

### "Virgin Australia became a budget airline"
I undertook a return flight from Hobart to Perth recently. On both flights the interior of the plane looked old, worn and filthy. There was no perishable food available from the menu as the plane had not been restocked. The flight attendants had to offer ice with all the drinks as they were pretty much room temperature. There are no longer any screens on the back of the seats, which wasn't a big problem, but there was no offer of devices for hire and the wifi was spotty with my feed freezing every 10 seconds. So on a four hour flight on a dirty old plane I ate Pringles and a chocolate bar and played games on my iPad. I'm not sure when Virgin Australia became a budget airline. I sure wish I had got the memo.

### "try to avoid whenever possible"
This is just another budget airline however one that is pretending it is a premium airline. I woke up this morning to a message from Virgin saying my 4 hour direct flight from Hobart to Perth was cancelled and instead they booked me on a flight from Hobart to Melbourne where I needed to stay the night, they kindly booked me a room in the airport hotel. They then booked me on a flight from Melbourne to Sydney the next day where I needed to change planes and then finally get a flight to Perth. The only compensation a $30 voucher for food. Seriously, how is this ok?! After calling Virgin they managed to get me on a different flight which meant cutting my stay in Hobart short and leaving for the airport immediately and taking a plane to Melbourne, waiting around for over 4 hours and then catching a flight to Perth that evening. The flight from Hobart to Melbourne was short which was just as well with the mood some of the flight attendants were in. The service from Perth to Hobart was equally poor. I am aware staff shortages are an Australia wide problem but this is scraping the bottom of the barrel Virgin! Where did all those smiley Virgin flight attendants go? So between cancelled flights, delays, no leg room, sour faced staff that try so very hard not to make eye contact and the high costs this is now an airline I will try to avoid whenever possible and would recommend everyone else to do the same

### "they decided to put me in different flight"
Flights cancelled. I had just an email that they decided to put me in different flight even though there were earlier flights. The gate people were saying different things to the service desk. I had to walk the entire domestic airport to find out what was happening. Online staff had no clue of cancellations generally no one knows what they are doing, and we have to accept it because we have no other choice so when someone will stop them ?

### "Never, ever again"
Not Verified |  
First time I have ever flown with Virgin Australia and it will be the last time. The night before departure I received an email saying I needed to book onto a (later) flight, no explanation given, no consideration given to arrangements I had made for relatives to pick me up from Brisbane airport. By this stage I had even received a Boarding Pass for my original flight. Took me 1.5 hours to rearrange my flight to an earlier time. Great start to my holiday! Then, two days before my return flight I received another email saying that I needed to book onto a later flight. I reluctantly did so. When I got to Brisbane airport I found another email (sent just 10 minutes before) saying that my plane had been delayed by two hours! A sympathetic and lovely ground staff person saved the day by taking me through the Service queue and getting me onto an earlier flight - only possible because I had arrived at Brisbane airport with lots of time to spare. What is going on Virgin? My experience travelling with you is that you don’t care if you add to your customers’ stress; you are contemptuous of arrangements made for pick-up/delivery to airports. Basically, you don’t give a stuff about the travel experience of your customers. Never, ever again.

### "a pleasant flight"
It was a pleasant flight. The plane left on time, check in was easy and the staff were friendly. Virgin only offered tea, coffee and water free which is no issue on such a short flight.

### "service was efficient and friendly"
I enjoyed the trip. Check in was easy and the flight left on time. The service was efficient and friendly. The meal was quite good but it could have been a bit more substantial. Also every flight seems to offer the same dish: Thai Curry. Desert was just a small piece of chocolate. The wine though, was excellent.

### "Comfortable seats"
Not Verified |  Comfortable seats on a short flight although delayed when taxing to runway, at Melbourne cabin crew were friendly but no Wi-Fi, but nearly missed flight to LAX because of delay.

### "what does my paid booking actually mean?"
I have always recommended Virgin so highly. I always say they take care of you when something goes wrong. This morning I received a text message with 2.5 hours notice that my return flight had been cancelled, and I was moved to a flight 2 days later. The online booking system to change the flight was not functioning. I'm left on hold for over half an hour, where the recording reminds me that Virgin will always treat me with respect, and they expect the same in return. I'm also calling poor service. I expect that honouring your customer's booking would be your priority. It seems that is not the case at all. I question then - what does my paid booking actually mean?

### "treat your customers with respect"
Virgin Australia how do you get away with stealing your clients money? Virgin cancelled my $4000 USD flight and I was forced to fly another Airline. I was ensured by Virgin that I would receive a full refund for the unused portion of my flight. As a Platinum Frequent Flier for multiple years they decided to declare bankruptcy and fold my $4000.00 into their claims. That is right, screw your best customers! Never flying Virgin ever again. Welcome to Qantas! What a loss of revenue for Virgin. Moral of the story treat your customers with respect!

### "told I would be refunded in full"
I over paid for my baggage and was told I would be refunded in full as their app was down at the time. I paid again and it has been three months now. No refund. I have made over 50 calls and had email contact with them and had been told I would get it in 24 hours. Didn’t come. That changed to 48 hours so I waited. Called again was told 5-7 business days. Didn’t come. Called again. Was told farther investigation was needed and would take 21 days. Done all that waiting then for an email saying sorry it will be in your account in two days. Still not in there. Called again and called my bank to see if money was pending. It wasn’t. I have sent more emails to ask where my $380 is and have herd nothing! I would never deal with his airline ever again! They have stolen from my family by not returning my money. I have complained and heard nothing back again! Sent more emails and no one is replying to me now! Got a reference number and have been told I am sorry and you will get your money.

### "plane clean but a little worn"
There was confusion boarding at Ballina, priority sign up but no indication where others go so everyone lined up in priority, no guidance or enforcement. The flight to Sydney was good, no hot drinks as apparently the flight was too short which is odd as flying from Mel to Canberra, 45 mins, hot drinks are served. Loving that Virgin let you know your bags are on board and when you land they arrived. Impressed. Sydney was delayed both boarding and taking off, but normal for Sydney. Flight attendants were nice, plane clean but a little worn inside. Bags took a while to arrive but all in all ok flights.

### "flights were both on time"
Great flight. Check in was easy, bag drop too with a staff member present if you need help. The flights were both on time. Boarding was fast with front air bridge and back stairs. Clean plane. Plane had few seats left. Good flight to Sydney, time for a quick meal in the food court then bonus on the flight to Ballina we had a great view of the harbour, bridge and opera house. The crew were friendly. The moving map is the only entertainment I used but there was a variety of TV shows and movies to watch on your own device. Luggage came quickly after arrival in Ballina. Possibly the only criticism was tight leg room

### "aircraft is bare bones"
The worst decision I ever made was to book flights with Virgin Australia Airlines for a family vacation to Bali from Los Angeles via Australia. Due to the pandemic, VA cancelled our flights and refused to refund our money, unlike most airlines who had no problem refunding their customers. VA went bankrupt and "DUE TO THE AUSTRALIAN GOVERNMENT" refused the refund. After numerous phone calls and emails, VA offered a Domestic Travel Credit only. How does that help when we live in California and would need international travel? It is absolutely absurd that the only way to recoup any monies we paid up front, is to travel by way of Australia and by a deadline! The new owners of VA are a mega corporation (I'll leave the name out), with billions of dollars, offered absolutely nothing to the many travelers who lost their flight money. The counter agents/flight attendants were kind and professional. The aircraft itself is bare bones. No in-flight entertainment other than using your personal device. No food/drinks (6+ hours Bali-Sydney) I will never fly with VA and please let this be a lesson to others when choosing VA in the future.

### "Absolutely disgusting Virgin"
Both my elderly parents are travelling home today on the above flight. Assistance had been booked which was almost non existent! Their driver took them to the bag drop and left them with other passengers waiting for assistance. My father who is 96 requires a wheelchair which had been requested and did arrive eventually. However, my mother was expected to lift 2 cases at the bag drop which proved very difficult for a lady in her later years! They were eventually helped by an off duty employee who gave them assistance through security. Otherwise my mother would have been expected to push my dad in his wheelchair. There obviously was no preparation for them even though it was requested. To make matters worse my dad was apart from my mother and his wallet and phone were left accidentally at security. Once they were together again in the lounge my mother asked him where his wallet and phone were. A kind Virgin staff member finally tracked them down from security. This was not a one time occurrence. The same treatment was experienced on the flight coming down to Melbourne four weeks ago. Not only are they elderly but business class passengers as well. What kind of airline treats their long time loyal and elderly passengers in this way? Absolutely disgusting Virgin!

### "New B737 Max is awesome"
Not Verified |  Absolutely fantastic flight. New B737 Max is awesome. Flight on both legs, BNE to Cairns and Cairns to Haneda were exceptional. Flight crew were brilliant, friendly and made our trip a delight.

### "I will never use them again"
Originally, I have purchased the tickets before Covid-19 in Jan 2020. They have cancelled my flights so, I’ve received credit voucher. The previous organisation collapsed during the pandemic and the new organisation emailed me that new expiry date is end of Jan 2023. I have noticed that they started operating the flights to Tokyo and I booked just before the expiry date. The price was very higher than original booking but I didn’t want to lose my credit so, I used it all. I had to pay extra $550 to book the return flights. When I book the flights I don’t have any choice to select the fee types. It was only one available for me as I was using the credit. It was unfair that I can’t add any checked bag only allowed 1x 30kg. Anyway, I needed to change the flight so, I contacted Virgin. After couple of phone calls I found that I have to pay over $800 to change the flight or they will take my $550 to the credit if I cancel it. That means $550 is going to be included to the original credit and the expiry date will be back to the original date. Which is end of Jan 23. So, if I cancel it, I’ll just lose whole money to them. They cancelled my flights and I recessed to refund money so many times but they refused. I regrettably booked the flights then I was going lose more money. It is not acceptable. I had to give up my on going flight but used the return flight to go back to Australia. Addition to that; • check in counter people don’t know how to transit my bags. I was told to take the baggage to the bag drop counter but there is no counter at the arrival airport building. I had to push my 30kg suitcase for about 500m and had to wait for about 30min to open the counter. • there is no meal provided on board. Virgin charge me about $700 one way though. And they were going to charge me another $800 but not included any meal or beverages. • there is no screen provided at the seat. Customers have to use their own electric device to access the entertainment. I wasn’t told before boarding. Not many people were using this service. Also, if you want to stop the movie while watching and resume it, it will have to start it again. How annoying. I won’t recommend anyone to fly with Virgin and I will never use them again.

### "I enjoyed my flight"
I enjoyed my flight. Check in was easy and the plane left on time. The staff were very friendly and helpful. Only water, tea and coffee was included - everything else had to be purchased. This was no big deal for such a short flight.

### "pleasantly surprised by the Virgin Product"
Having flown with Qantas many times previously I was pleasantly surprised by the Virgin Product if any thing comparing to my last Qantas experience the Virgin was a better product. Checking in while busy was okay. The lounge is comfortable and comparable to the Qantas Club lounge. Boarding was prioritized and you received a beverage prior to take off. The seat was comfortable and larger than the economy seat. The service was very good with a hot meal and multiple beverages offered. The cabin crew were friendly and diligent. On landing my bags came out with priority, something Qantas has been unable to do for a while.

### "sorry but basically bad luck"
We were booked for a 5.30 pm flight from Melbourne direct to Denpasar Bali. The day before the flight we got an email saying that our flight has been changed and is leaving one hour earlier We got to the airport and lined up the staff had no idea that the flight has been changed and on their monitor it still showed flight leaving at 5.30. So we got our boarding pass and headed to the departure lounge we sat there for a while and about half an hour before departure. Our name was called to the airline desk and we were told that as I booked 2 seats with extra leg room and I booked the first seats past the business class they said we’re going to put you 2 together, as we have a family that wants to sit together. I assumed that they were going to just put us together but still in the same row I didn’t even bother to look at the boarding pass and the reason I booked these seats was that I’ve just had a back operation and needed access to the isle. As we got on the plane I realized that they moved us to row 5 which I had no access to the isle and the guy on the isle seat was fast asleep so I had to wake him up every half an hour to get out. I tried to complain to virgin and their reply was sorry but basically bad luck.

### "Staff were friendly and helpful"
A very enjoyable flight. Check in was easy .There was a slight departure delay. Staff were friendly and helpful. The food served was quite good but it could have been a bit more substantial. They also seem to offer the same dishes on their flights. Desert was a tiny chocolate. However the wine served was excellent. Overall a good flight.

### "it was a pleasant flight"
Due to a departure delay with my Sydney to Melbourne flight, this flight was delayed too. Nevertheless it was a pleasant flight. Staff were friendly and efficient and I did not have to wait long to collect my baggage.

### "Worst airline I have travelled on"
Worst airline I have travelled on. On a recent trip from Melbourne to Gold Coast the flight was delayed 4.5 hrs. Without notice they split our party and sent son and 2 young children via Sydney. With 4.5 hr delay, no apology in airport, no refreshments offered and rude ground staff. Customer services hide behind 'Conditions of Carriage

### "Everything else had to be purchased"
Check in was easy. The flight left on time. The staff were very friendly, helpful and well organised. The only free offerings were tea, coffee and water. Everything else had to be purchased. The purchased offerings were only snacks. Perhaps more could be offered on a flight departing at dinnertime? Some airlines give the opportunity for passengers to pre book a meal. Otherwise a very enjoyable flight.

### "a very pleasant flight"
I enjoyed the flight. Self check in was very easy. The flight left on time and the flight attendants were friendly and efficient. Meal service was minimal. Just free coffee, tea and water. Everything else had to be purchased. It may be a good idea for virgin to have the option of pre purchasing meals, particularly with flight departing at dinner time. Otherwise a very pleasant flight.

### "What a terrible service"
Not Verified |  I came at the check in desk 20 minutes before the plane was scheduled to leave due to a delay with the previous flight. With a little bit of goodwill I would have been on the plane in time as I had only carry-on. But the employees mentioned that the gate was closed and they not going to delay their flight because of me, and turned their back. Tried to explain that I only had a transfer and hoping that they could help or advise. Only answer that came was to buy a new ticket. After searching for Virgin office in the airport, found out that it was closed. What a terrible service.

### "Terrible experience"
Terrible experience. My flight was cancelled and I wasn’t even put on the next one. To make things worse, I wasn’t granted in the lounge either. A very long stay at the airport and no service at all.

### "Both flights operated on time"
Melbourne to Hobart return. Both flights operated on time, and baggage appeared reasonably quickly on the carousel. The flight down on a 737 Max was very smooth and pleasant. The boarding process from the rear was very efficient, and the cabin service was good. The flight back on a rather tired looking 737 wasn't quite as pleasant, with unclear boarding announcements and more rushed cabin service, but still OK. Hot drinks and water were served free (only water on the outward trip). There are different bag drop procedures in Melbourne and Hobart. In Melbourne, don't imagine that you can go straight to bag drop if you have checked in at home. No! You must go to the check-in machine to get your bag tag first. You might as well save time at home and check in at the airport. In Hobart, please go to the bag drop counter to get your bag tag.

### "hasn't credited my miles"
Good flight and good crew. There was nothing special on this flight, but it was just a short flight. While the seat was ok for such a short flight, the aircraft should get an update, though. Unfortunately Virgin Australia still after 5 months hasn't credited my miles to my Qatar account and is ignoring my e-mails to customer service. Strangely Virgina Australia doesn't allow people living outside of Australia to open a Velocity account. That made me wonder if they just don't appreciate business with tourists.

### "a pleasant flight"
Check in was easy and the flight left on time. Staff were friendly and helpful. The toilet, unfortunately, could have been a bit cleaner. Food was limited to snacks for purchase and the only drinks offered were tea, coffee and water. Overall a pleasant flight.

### "staff were very efficient and friendly"
I enjoyed the flight. Check in was easy and the flight left on time. The staff were very efficient and friendly. The only free drinks were coffee, tea and water. Everything else had to be purchased which was no big deal, given it was a short flight.

### "made me feel comfortable"
Not Verified |  The team at Melbourne Virgin lounge and the crew on flight 1328 Melbourne to Hobart were absolutely amazing. I had injured my knee on way to the airport and was unable to put weight on it. Every person I had contact with from the service desk to the young chap who wheeled me to the gate to the fabulous ladies on the flight and the ground grew at Hobart went above and beyond what I expected. They were kind, helpful and made me feel comfortable even though I was embarrassed at all the fuss I was causing. I fly regularly with Virgin and will always recommend them.

### "helpful and efficient staff"
I enjoyed the trip. Easy check in, on time departure and friendly, helpful and efficient staff. The meal was tasty but perhaps they could include a more substantial dessert then a small chocolate? The drinks served were excellent.

### "I enjoyed the flight"
I enjoyed the flight. Check in was very easy and the flight departed on time. The food served was very tasty and the wine served was excellent. The staff were very friendly and helpful.

### "customer service was dreadful"
Got to the gate to scan my pass only for them to tell me my connecting flight to be cancelled. My flight was transferred at my arrival time changed from 5pm to 10pm. I understand things happen and this is not the first time by any means - but the customer service I received was dreadful afterward - not any slight remorse or care in the world, just on ya way son, go wait another few hours. I understand that it's not the air hostess fault - but it is their job to provide some sort of customer service. It wasn't provided this time

### "attendants were very friendly"
I enjoyed the flight. Check in was easy and the flight actually departed early. Flight attendants were very friendly and efficient and the aircraft was very clean .

### "staff were friendly and efficient"
Unfortunately my flight was cancelled and I was put on a flight departing 30 minutes later and then that flight was delayed by 45 minutes. Ah well, the staff were friendly and efficient.

### "Staff very friendly and helpful"
Check in was easy. Staff were very friendly and helpful. The only drink available was water, which was no big deal given it was such a short flight. Snacks were available for purchase. Unfortunately the flight was delayed for 40 minutes.

### "Staff were very friendly and helpful"
I had the option of boarding a plane set to depart 1 hour prior to my intended flight which was great. Unfortunately it was delayed by over 40 minutes. Staff were very friendly and helpful. Food was minimal but that's ok given it was a short flight.

### "Service was friendly and very helpful"
An enjoyable flight. Easy and friendly check in. The plane left on time. Service was friendly and very helpful. The food was limited. Just tea, coffee and water with snacks to purchase but that is no problem given that it was a short flight.

### "did not let us know until we arrive at airport"
Not Verified |  Virgin cancelled our flight from Sydney to Perth on the 14 December 2022, and did not let us know until we arrive at airport, then booked us to Perth via Brisbane and only just made the flight. Then a 10 hour wait before flying to Perth. Arriving at Perth airport the next morning, missing a whole day in Perth, with out of pocket costs for three meals, luggage storage, and taxi fare. We also paid our travel agent $200 extra to get a early flight which was more wasted money.

### "meal served was very tasty"
I enjoyed my flight. Check in was easy. The plane left on time. The flight attendants were very friendly and efficient. The meal served (Thai Chicken Curry) was very tasty. Maybe they could serve a more substantial sweet than a small chocolate. The wine served was excellent.

### "friendly flight attendants"
Unfortunately there was a delay of 1 hour. Otherwise a pleasant flight. Easy check in, friendly flight attendants and a clean plane. Possibly they could offer more options for food Eg the option of pre booking and pre paying a meal.

### "completely failed in their duty of care"
Not Verified | We had booked and had an email confirming meet and assist support for our Autistic son who also has anxiety issues. On arriving at Cairns to check in the details of the support were not on his booking even though we had been assured it was. After speaking to a supervisor our son was taken through security but then left alone at the gate. The agreed support was that he would be taken to the plane, this did not happen. We called Virgin again to reconfirm the support would be in place at Sydney again assured it would be. When he landed at Sydney again no support he had to ask and show the email. He was then meant to be escorted to collect his hold bag and escorted to terminal 1 where he would be handed over to the airline supporting him on his onward flight. What actually happened was he was taken to collect his bag then shown the platform told to get on the train and get off at the next stop. He was then left completely alone. Virgin Australia completely failed in their duty of care for a vulnerable adult

### "Comfortable flight eventually"
Flight was delayed due to weather issues, and was rebooked for the next day, delayed again and finally flew later that day. Comfortable flight eventually, and the domestic lounge in Sydney was excellent too. Followed up on missed flight related issues and was handled promptly and very professionally by Roshelyn & Christine the guest relations people. Thank you.

### "staff were very friendly and helpful"
I enjoyed the flight. There was a slight delay with departure, but that was no big hassle. The staff were very friendly and helpful. There was limited food available (they ran out of juice ) but that was no big deal on such a brief flight.

### "Not a single time it has been on time"
Not Verified |  Not a single time it has been on time, even international flight get delayed by an 1 hour. Flown recently 3 times with it, but every time same issue. I thought previously that it could be genuine reason and booked next time, but no, there management is worst

### "won't fly them ever again"
Not Verified |  Flight from Perth to Gold Coast and return 3 days later. Before outbound, selected lowest bid for upgrade to business. Luckily didn't get it on the outbound as realised while boarding, business class looked terrible and definitely not worth paying anything extra money for. Not even sure if they serve food, likely also need to purchase? Anyways, trying to withdraw my bid for the return flight seemed impossible. Links to cancel resulted in error on multiple attempts. Tried logging in again and select lower bid. No contact numbers etc. On the morning of the return flight, I received a congratulations email on the offer accepted for upgrade. At the airport, I explained that I didn't want this. It was very close to impossible, but perseverance and 2 phone numbers later, I got downgraded (nobody can put you through to this department - it's 'separate from Virgin'). However, still had to complete an online refund request form. Did all that, flew normal economy and received an automatic email reply stating receipt of email and a ref no. 2 Weeks later, no refund. Phoned the number in that email. They couldn't understand that ref no. Gave my original flight details, but they couldn't give me the email or phone number of this 'bid-upgrade' department as 'it's separate from Virgin' (again). It's now 2 months later, heaps of emails back and forth and every single email comes back stating their terms and conditions state it's non-refundable. I've used all my points on Velocity accumulated through credit card purchases to clear all my ties with Virgin and out of principle, won't fly them ever again, if I can help it. Even if they are cheaper.

### "check-in machines kept locking me out"
Worst airline ever, in terms of customer service or even getting them to do anything that's paying them money to get nothing or something paltry. Their check-in machines kept locking me out. I had to pay $300 just for a single piece of additional check-in luggage, and it wasn't over the total weight limit either. And this is just for the return leg only. They changed details like thrice. They refused to take my debit card and I had to argue and prove I was cash broke (show 4 empty wallets) for 30mins before they even attempted to swipe it to pay for above $300 "upgrade", which worked second try after a system error. Their website didn't work. Their Business Class upgrade is somehow cheaper than the additional check-in luggage. The ticket counter flat out refused me before and after trying to check-in at the unmanned kiosks to upgrade my baggage allowance. The phone people refused to talk to me after the website would not let me upgrade the baggage allowance. Also, my return flight was changed with them wanting to simply just not do it with no refunds and charge me a higher amount. However, after some convincing on the phone a few weeks before, they reluctantly rebooked a new return flight only a few hours after the original. It's almost it's my fault for booking a seat on a flight that is not profitable (nobody else booked or not enough cabin count).

### "no doubts choosing VA on future flights again"
What a pleasant surprise. Always thought VA was a low standard and/or a low cost carrier. We choose for VA because there was a lot of hassle going on with Qantas with exorbitant ticket prices. Given the only 1.15 h flight we gave VA a try. Their lounge was superb. Beautiful tarmac view, good food items, great showers (we arrived from SIN early morning and continued to Tasmania). Priority boarding for business class (only 8 seats in a 2-2 configuration). A fresh and clean plane. Great seats, a lot of legroom. A welcome drink was served. During the flight a more or less complete meal was served including ‘bubbles’. FA was very nice and did her utmost best to provide a feeling of warm hospitality. Remarkable was that the aisle between business class was separated from economy with a barrier (thick cord), purple acrylic glass separated the seats. It felt pretty private. Thumbs up and no doubts choosing VA on future flights again.

### "Will never fly with them again"
Virgin sent me a text at 4am on the date of my departure Saturday while I was on holiday camping telling me that my flight from Launceston to Adelaide had been cancelled and booked a route for the following day without consultation with me. This route unbelievably required me to leave Launceston at 6.30 am Sunday - despite my being in holiday and having nowhere to sleep, waiting for around 4 hours in Melbourne, then flying to the Gold Coast and from there arriving in Adelaide at 4.30 pm! It would have been almost quicker to catch the ferry and drive. No explanation for the cancellation. Will never fly with them again

### "off-loaded because they are overbooked"
Not Verified |  Flight VA609 Friday 25. November 2022 11:15 When Boarding, at the gate I have been told that I will not fly today, I have been off-loaded because they are overbooked due to another cancelation. No alternative has been offered, I had to find out on my own. To mention I am flying frequently and spend quite a lot of money with Virgin. I claimed to be put back on this plane (thanks to the lovely ladies from ground staff in the lounge), that is where I am now but not sure where my luggage is or will be. Plane is already 35 min late due to unloading and reloading of luggage.

### "hated whole flying experience"
They canceled 1 hour before takeoff after checking to the airport. And they were so rude, replacing my seat 5 hours later and saying if you don t take it, you have to fly next day. So I had to accept it even though I had business meeting that evening. They offered refund saying I won t be able to book another airline cause they are all booked. They said it is due to windy condition but there was no sign of wind. Soon I found ticket 1 hour earlier so booked on my phone and asking for refund .. they said they can not refund but give me credit cause it is the weather that got them canceled flight. Even though they offered me refund before, so I had to fight to get refund saying they keep changing their words however they like to. They were not sorry or did not compensate for 5 hour delay. They were rather threatening throughout the procedure. Most unkind customer service at service desk. I hated whole flying experience. Will never fly with them again if I can. And refund has not come through yet ... I will wait and see

### "a good experience"
I enjoyed the trip. Check in was easy, as was the bag drop at Melbourne Airport. The flight was slightly delayed, but it was no big deal. The staff were friendly and helpful. The cost only included beverage or food and water, but for such a short flight that was no big deal. Overall a good experience.

### "Staff were both efficient and friendly"
Check in was very smooth and friendly. The plane was slightly delayed but only by a few minutes. Staff were both efficient and friendly. Only water was included, but I managed to purchase a beer and some nuts for a reasonable price. I didn't have to wait long to collect my bags. Overall a very good flight.

### "didn’t provide us with a snack for free"
Not Verified |  I just paid $950 for a flight from Perth to Sydney, it’s over. 4 hour flight and they didn’t even provide us with a snack for free. I strongly believe they should provide passengers a meal on this long flight especially when you are over charging. I will definitely be giving business to Qantas who provide free meals on the longer flights in Australia.

### "Worst airline I ever used"
Worst airline I ever used and will never use again. I was travelling with two kids from Melbourne to Sydney On Sunday. They postponed the flight to Monday. I had no accommodation in Melbourne and had a medical appointment in Sydney on Monday morning. I waited 40mins on the phone to find a solution to my problem. What I got was zero sympathy and support. They also hanged up the phone when I requested the name of rude person I was talking to. Zero customer care. Zero taking responsibility to their mistakes

### "Really unhappy with them"
Horrible airline. Will not be flying with them again. I was supposed to fly a few days ago with Virgin Australia, but they delayed my flight 15 hours and did not provide a refund. Really unhappy with them.

### "a budget airline once again"
Not Verified | Still apparent that Virgin Australia are running ghost flights, flight cancelled at 1am with no explanation. Only option to fly via Brisbane to get to Melbourne 8 hours later. Missed a family funeral but as expected offshore call centre has no appreciation of this concern. Virgin very much a budget airline once again.

### "12 weeks or more for a refund"
Put in complaint as flight cancelled and when asked for rebooking made it Mon instead of Sun. Then flight cancelled again Mon and airline rebooked for Tues. Already missed 1 day work couldn't miss another. Told had to get back to Sydney for work. Told could get flight to Canberra and then bus back to Sydney. No other options. Told them to cancel booking. Now been told have to wait 12 weeks or more for a refund. Totally unacceptable

### "still double booking flights"
Not Verified | Sad to find out that Virgin Australia is still double booking flights, got pushed onto a later one, the lady on the phone changed her story and said it was moved due to maintenance, but I'm at the airport now and of course that flight is still running on time with no issue at all. Feeling pretty inconvenienced at the moment and it made worse when the the lady over the phone to lies to me and can't even admit it. I thought Virgin would be better than Jetstar. At least they already booked me onto the later flight before they sent the email rather than making me deal with it.

### "surprised me with an upgrade"
I flew with Virgin Australia from MEL to PER in September 2022. As a Platinum frequent flyer, I have access to the Virgin Australia lounge at Melbourne Airport T3. While I was unwinding at the lounge, VA surprised me with an upgrade to Business! Thank you VA. Whilst VA is only flying Boeing 737-800, the surprise upgrade on the East-West leg meant that I will be fed with delicious food and nicer seats. The seat was comfortable, and has a power point for me to charge my iPad or iPhone. For dinner, I had the chicken parmigiana which was delicious and VA service is brilliant. The crew keeps coming around fo keep us well fed and hydrated. My luggages arrived safely in Perth! Overall, I prefer to fly VA in Australia. The suggestions I have for VA to improve are: 1) Upgrade more fleet to either Boeing 737 MAX or Airbus A320/321 neo; 2) Lend or procure more twin-aisle fleet such as Boeing 787 to expand its route or network of services.

### "Plane in a very good condition and clean"
Plane in a very good condition and clean. Nice and friendly welcome from crew. Flight was on time and safety procedures were done physically. After take-off, inflight service started after 45 minutes from buy Menu, also you could buy Amenity kit. There is Virgin app where you can see flight path and basic games and TV series. Overall very nice flight.

### "staff were friendly and helpful"
I enjoyed my flight. The staff were friendly and helpful. Check in was quick and easy. The flight left on time. All food must be paid for which doesn't matter with such a short flight .

### "a great way to finish a break"
Check in was very easy. There was a slight delay in departure but was no big deal. The staff were very friendly and good humoured as well as very well organised. The food was quite good and the wines served were excellent. Overall a great way to finish a break.

### "only provide free tea, coffee and water"
The flight left on time. Check in was easy and staff were helpful and efficient. In economy Virgin Australia only provide free tea, coffee and water. Everything else must be paid for,.

### "Staff is extremely rude"
On the trip from Brisbane to Gladstone we paid extra in order to pre-booked our seats. When we boarded we were given seats in the back of the plane, no window and no leg room 9my husband is 6ft and my son really close to 6ft). Well my husband had to sit with his legs into the aisle and son stretched his legs in front of my seat, which meant I had to twist myself in my seat. When I asked for the seats I booked and paid extra for I was told travel agents have no authority to book seats, the check in staff decide who sits where and if I don't like it we can get off. There was no snack or refreshments on the flight either - despite this being listed on the itinerary. Staff is extremely rude and when I filed a complaint I was brushed off with we decide what seats we allocate, so take it up with the travel agent. If you don't like it fly a different airline!

### "Awful experience"
Not Verified | Awful experience, has us waiting for our delayed flight for three hours at 10pm on a Friday night just for it to be cancelled and us to be told the only alternate flight was the next day at 1pm which will cause me to miss my sisters wedding that I was flying to Melbourne to attend. No other help or compensation offered

### "Worst service ever"
Worst service ever. Pre paid seats and not given them. Split a family up, kids still in primary school. The rude hostess at the boarding gate scowling asks if we were happy to hold up the flight so she can sort it out. No intention of correcting the error or apology on behalf of the airline. Completely makes us feel as if we are the issue. Horrible service and will not fly again.

### "oh my the seats are tight"
Was pretty happy with Virgin, we were only delayed about 15 minutes. Boarding was good, but oh my the seats are tight. My husband is not terribly tall and he struggled. I would suggest any tall people go for the exit rows. Only water was offered but being just a short flight, that was fine. I didn’t bother with entertainment, rather enjoyed the view. It was a nice easy flight stress free. Shame it’s so squeezy.

### "customer service is very rude"
Terrible airline. I had a flights from Sydney to Denpasar and my flight was 5.40pm and i got messages from Virgin Australia customer service it says my flight is cancel and new flight is on 1pm to Brisbane and then Denpasar. Actually Sydney to Denpasar flight were not cancel, they sold my ticket to someone else for more expensive. And they took my flights much cheaper fares and flight time is earlier. Actually to Denpasar ticket via from Brisbane much cheaper then direct flight. And also they rescheduled my flight just before one hour from Brisbane flight. They gave me one hour notice for international flight. They are nightmare, customer service is very rude and arrogant.

### "found it rude and annoying"
Not Verified |  First leg was great MEL to DRW. Second leg to Perth not so good. They ran out of food very quickly, and for someone with food allergies that's really frustrating, as it means going hungry for 4hrs, and also didn't even have decaf coffee. Who wants to drink caffeine at 9pm? That's the main issue I had, that and a member of staff referring to people as "you's", which I find very unprofessional. For anyone who isn't Australian, it's how some refer to more than one person. It's slang, and I personally just found it rude and annoying. Also the WiFi didn't work, not for me anyway, so I couldn't watch anything, but fortunately I knew this would happen and loaded some stuff onto my phone beforehand, something I recommended everyone do. Considering the ticket cost me $550, I expected more.

### "they have the right to change our seats"
We returned to Perth from Canberra via Sydney on 18th Sep22. Check-in service in Canberra was excellent. The lady at the Virgin counter in Canberra checked us through to Perth and gave us boarding passes for Canberra-Sydney and Sydney-Perth. She noticed I was very tall and arranged an exit row seat for my self and my wife. Sydney was a different story. When we showed our boarding passes to Perth (VA569 Depart 2015) the women at the Virgin counter informed us in a very surly manner that our seats were allocated to someone else, and myself and my wife were moved to other seats and no longer sitting together. I argued that we already had allocated seats and boarding passes, so she summoned her supervisor who was just as rude and said that they have the right to change our seats without notice even after boarding passes are issued. As a result I endured 4 1/2 hours of hell with my knees buried into the seat in front, in a tired old 737 with no leg room.

### "ignores the facts when they are wrong"
Virgin Australia seems to be a company based on greed. A company that ignores the facts when they are wrong, treat loyal customers of many years terribly, that simply seem unequipped to handle their mistakes, is a company that both unethical and greedy. On this flight I was in the lounge, as is usual, the flight was delayed by 40 minutes. When they called for boarding the delayed flight I went to the gate to be told it was closed. When it was called we used the toilet then went straight to the gate. Put simply the time that the flight was called with the time it took to walk to gate was not enough. Returning the lounge I was told, in the most awful manner, I had to leave and re enter (rudel ) and then charged $300 for the next flight for myself and my employee. I followed up with customer service. They sent an email that completely ignored the situation and told me that you should get the flight 30 min before departure. What is the point of the lounge calling the flight if it isn't correct. Beyond that the customer service completely ignored the actual situation and just told me rules that didnt apply to the situation. I am transitioning over to another airline now but be warned. On the surface they seems very approachable but in reality they are crooked, greedy and backward in their approach to the customers. Cursing feels more suited to the situation but this review will have to do.

### "will never refund your money"
They have different policies for call center booking and airport booking for missed flights. If you are unaware of it you will end up paying unfairly for all. Customer care agents at Brisbane airport are not at all helpful. They will finish their personal talk before attending to you. I was there 30 minutes prior to the plane taking off without any check-in bags and have been refused to board while others 3 to 4 minutes before leaving the plane got in. They will never refund your money. They are extremely expensive and I don't see the hype for that. After 1 month of waiting all they said is they are not going to refund the money.

### "my preference of airline"
Virgin Australia is my preference of airline when travelling domestically throughout Australia. I have always been a Qantas user however since Covid I just can't justify the huge premium they charge, especially as a frequent flyer. The staff at Virgin are amongst the best, the new Melbourne lounge is amazing, they have a good selection of food and alcohol - I just wish they offered spirits in their lounges, but this is offered onboard. Virgin has a much trendier/youthful approach which I appreciate. The business class product is on par with Qantas, great food and drink. I find the seat plush and spacious. The seat doesn't offer an IFE screen but this is no issue as I travel between Mel-Syd which is an hour flight - they will give business class passengers an iPad or you can stream off your own device.

### "Virgin needs to catch up with the rest of the companies"
Not Verified | The flight was alright but the airplane was very outdated, other airlines have TV screens and usb charging ports at every chair no matter economy or business. Other airlines also offer a free meal during your flight. Virgin needs to catch up with the rest of the companies. Also the wifi connection was terrible and kept dropping out.

### "helpful and pleasant staff"
Not Verified |  On August 23rd 2022 my wife and I travelled on a 2 way trip from Coolum Beach (Qld) to Melbourne. I was having issues with my feet and required assistance to get to the boarding gate. I had not previously organised this but thanks to the Virgin airport staff and their wonderful attitude all was organised by this very helpful and pleasant staff. The flight staff were equally professional and nothing was too much trouble for them. We enjoyed the same excellent service on our return flight. We will certainly be Virgin customers from this point on.

### "not responding or processing my claim for compensation"
Not Verified |  Awful company! Avoid at all costs! The Airline lost my luggage in Brisbane & are not responding or processing my claim for compensation they will find ways to delay the process as much as possible I imagine in the hope people will give up! They pass you from one department to another without getting any real response, the crew at the airport are understaffed and over worked advising they would call me back each time they did not I had to make numerous trips back to the airport at my expense to just speak to someone as they will not answer the phones. I have never experienced such poor customer service. Virgin Australia should be ashamed of themselves

### "all the tickets are cancelled"
Not Verified |  At the check-in, they cancel the ticket of my wife because on her passport is marked her name of birth and that of bride! After 40 minutes of conversation, they tell us that all the tickets are cancelled because it's too late, even though we were booked well in advance, and they postpone them until tomorrow, telling us to pay for the tickets again. When we leave they start to laugh. The softest and most unpleasant staff.

### "I enjoyed my flight"
I enjoyed my flight. Check in was fast and friendly. The flight left on time and the staff were very courteous and courteous, The only free offerings were tea, coffee and water, which is no big deal as it was a very short flight. A good flight.

### "A good flight"
A good flight. It was very busy at the airport. Luckily for me I was able to use priority check in. The service was both efficient and very friendly. The only free offerings are water, tea and coffee which is OK given it was such a short flight.

### "staff seemed unhappy and unhelpful"
3 days prior I flew to Sydney from Brisbane with my 2 and 4yr old daughters and elderly parents via Rex airline. The staff were so friendly and plentiful complimentary food and drinks on board. Then at Sydney airport, when returning via Virgin Australia, I asked for assistance with my elderly parents. I got directed to check in bags counter, then ticket counter and then back to check in counter for a wheelchair. I was told they can help push 1 wheelchair for 1 parent, but no buggy available for long journey to gate and then declined as I said we had to get food on way to gate. On plane, first flight delayed 10mins due to late crew member. Then no complimentary food and then only tea and coffee. No juice or milk for my 2 and 4y old who I paid full seat price for. When at end of flight my 2y old was busting to wee, they said I can use toilet, but needed to hurry up, which was unnecessary to say and rude. All staff seemed unhappy and unhelpful in general, maybe due to financial pinch. Sadly I don't see a future for this airline.

### "Virgin Australia has absolutely gone downhill very rapidly"
Regardless of delays, luggage or ticketing issues, Virgin Australia has absolutely gone downhill very rapidly. Airplanes are generally dirty, outdated and lacking any comfort. Virgin is now almost certainly a budget airline but without the budget prices and is more likely a competitor for Jetstar than Qantas when it comes to service. Regardless of what route I’ve taken with them over the last two years, it has been even worse each time. The only thing that could salvage this airline is if they dropped their prices to match the quality of their aircraft and customer service.

### "Flight changed, delayed, changed again"
Flight changed, delayed, changed again, and down grade my cabin class (business to economy). The customer service have no hard filling, no say sorry, rude, and just put the new tickets on the table. Until today, I did not receive my money back. Better close and stop first the operation until Virgin can proof to do better.

### "worst airline for Business Class"
Virgin Australia has got to be the worst airline for Business Class. There is no Business Class lounge available at night, no compensation for food and drink and/or meal voucher. The actual aircraft seat is terrible, just a little bit of leg room for 5 times the price of an economy ticket. The drinks consists of “sparkling or water”, no bar service at all. The food is mediocre, would have preferred a McDonalds burger and chips instead. The Business fare keeps going up, while the associated promised food and other perks are minimal or non-existent.

### "A very enjoyable flight"
A very enjoyable flight. Check in was surprisingly easy and the flight left on time. The staff were very friendly and efficient. The food served was very tasty and the drinks served were excellent.

### "they should be providing service and support"
Not Verified |  Firstly, the booking system is rubbish, such that passengers are not able to manage their booking ourselves and must call through to the customer service. Though they do pick up the call pretty quick, it is pointless as all they can and will tell you is that they can't do anything for you (when they actually can). My husband booked a ticket for me to fly out on a Thursday to see my father in law who has just been hospitalised. However, something cropped up at home and I could not leave till the next day. I called to ask for a change of flight. First time I called, I was told all flights on Friday are sold and so they could not change it for me. I was naïve and believed in it. I even thanked the staff. But it then dawned upon me that I was checking the tickets online earlier and there are still seats available. So I called back again and the staff (I believe it's a different one) told me the same lie, that no seats are available. I pointed out to her that there are seats available online. She then told me a cock and bull story about how the system is not updated online and if customers were to go ahead and book online, they will get an error message. I then questioned them about truthfulness in their product publishing and advertising. It's a hoax then. I was certain they could do something about it and so asked to speak with a senior staff member. She put me through and funnily enough, this senior staff was able to find a seat for me on Friday, when the other 2 staff had insisted that all tickets on Friday were sold. However, I had to pay another $370 to have that changed. When my husband booked the ticket, it was stated that we are entitled to 1 change. The senior staff said "yes you are entitled to 1 change but you need to pay the difference". How is that considered "entitled to 1 change"? As it was too much to pay, I was not sure if I wanted to go ahead or just simply cancel it, as it would cost about the same. Later my husband called them and explained the situation. They were insistent in "not being able to do anything" at first. But after my husband's persistently requesting, they finally agreed to a refund in the form of a voucher. This goes to show that they are actually able to provide some form of assistance to help us and there are many options. However, they choose to just tell the customer that they can't do anything and turn the customers away, forcing them to accept the flight or to forgo the ticket. I think these staff have either forgotten or didn't realise that airline is a service industry, they should be providing service and support. Even more so, if they expect customers to call their customer service line, there should be some real help offered.

### "Very disappointed with Virgin Australia"
Not Verified |  Very disappointed with Virgin Australia after series of multiple cancellation and re-scheduling our flights. It took us 14 hrs from Sydney to Cairns then ended up missing our luggage. We experienced 1 rude staff at the boarding gate 39. Now early on our holidays we lost our booked rental car and still sourcing for clothing for ourselves. Not sure bow long until they found our luggage.

### "stripped my seating allocation"
Not Verified |  I am very angry with this airline they literally stripped my seating allocation all because I paid points (meaning the flight was free). I was so frustrated with the crew about the ongoing situation with doubts of the next available flight getting kicked out. I am begging everyone to not use the program Velocity Frequent Flyer as it’s an absolute joke. They have the right to kick you out if you didn’t pay by money as they count it as a “low flyer”. I am very disgusted with this business as I will back away from this airline and hopefully they can change their stupid system.

### "Huge waste of time"
Not Verified | Gold Coast to Melbourne. Absolutely terrible. I was meant to fly to Melbourne from the Gold Coast the morning if the 5th of July: my flight was cancelled and rescheduled 2 days later with a 4 hour layover in Sydney with 2 hours notice. As if that wasn’t inconvenient enough, they cancelled that flight too, rescheduling it to another day later. My 5 day trip was cut in half and then half again. I was meant to arrive 9am on the 5th and now I am scheduled to arrive at 3pm on the 8th. Huge waste of time and massive waste of money. Save your money, time, effort and happiness, fly someone else.

### "Avoid Virgin at all costs"
Flight cancelled the night before, rescheduled for the next day. That flight was then delayed for 4 hours so we missed everything we had planned to do on our family trip. Avoid Virgin at all costs.

### "The flight was uneventful"
On checking in two hours prior, we were told to come back as we were too early. We sat and had coffee as there is not much else to do land side. On checking in through the premium lane, the staff member was checking in some of the 81 children (school trip) on our flight so wait we did. No lounge in Cairns, apparently they used to have one. Boarding was efficient and we were welcomed on board warmly. The flight was uneventful, entertainment worked fine. The chicken we chose was okay, nothing special and the potato was gluey. Nothing as a dessert. There should at least be a cookie.

### "Worst airline ever"
Not Verified |  Worst airline ever and I’ll never fly with them again. Our flight was canceled and they rebooked us with Jetstar however couldn’t provide us with the booking reference number therefore we were unable to check with Jetstar and wasted a whole day at the Hamilton island airport. Their service staff left work at 9:45 am in the morning and contact center staff just kept telling us to ask the airport service desk which is ridiculous. I’ll recommend Jetstar as even if they might cancel your flights they can put you on a Qantas flight as long as there are seats available. Leave Virgin alone until they learn how to treat their passengers correctly.

### "it was okay but improvements can be made"
Check in was fast in the priority line with only one before us. The lounge was fine, not too busy with a selection of hot food, pastries, fruit cups. The coffee was good and welcome as it was very early. Priority screening through the lounge made the experience was less stressful. The flight was full. Boarding was orderly and efficient, both from front and back. On board our FA was so nice. Makes such a difference. About 30 min delay in take off. The breakfast on board was lovely. I had a nice quiche, yogurt and pastry. Shame the entertainment system didn’t work for anyone on board for this 3.5 hr flight. No USB port and no divider between business and economy. Steady stream of economy passengers using the front toilet. It soon became dirty. The coffee was terrible. All in all it was okay but improvements can be made.

### "a very big queue at check in"
There was a very big queue at check in. It's a pity that passengers who check in via the internet or kiosk have to line up again for "bag drop". With QANTAS the bags can be dropped of by the passengers. The plane left on time and the staff were friendly and helpful. Food had to be purchased.

### "Staff were friendly and helpful"
Check in was straightforward and the plane left on time. Staff were friendly and helpful. All food and drink, except coffee, tea and water had to be purchased, which was no big deal as the flight was about two hours.

### "I enjoyed the flight"
I enjoyed the flight. Check in was easy and take off was punctual. The staff were friendly and helpful. The only complimentary drinks offered were water, tea and coffee. There were snacks and drinks to purchase. That was no big issue as it was a fairly short flight.

### "Overall uneventful flight"
Perth to Sydney. I flew Virgin Australia from Perth to Sydney and to a nice surprise it is the newly retrofit Boeing 737-800 with new colour scheme. As Platinum member of Velocity frequent flyer, I get to upgrade to Economy X (seat with extra legroom) for free and I do appreciate the extra legroom on a 4-hour flight. VA stopped serving free meal onboard except for hot coffee, tea and water so make sure you pack your own meal or fill up at the lounge (for Velocity Gold and Platinum members) before you fly. Overall uneventful flight but VA could improve by improving its offerings such as in-seat USB-C port.

### "blend of arrogance and incompetence"
A perfect blend of arrogance and incompetence! I booked a trip from Syd to Perth. Barely an hour before boarding they sent me an email saying flight has been cancelled and they rerouted my itinerary through 3 extra stopovers and an extra 9 hours of flight time and transit! Absurd entitlement and narcissism. I was already at the airport and was told that if i wanted to talk or see any other options, by that time my rerouted flight (which would leave just 15 mins later than my original time) would leave and I maybe left without any options. Ruined my whole day, took me 14 hours instead of 5, made me miss an urgent meeting, made me run around the airport from desk to desk, and all that while not a single apology or sorry from any of their despicably behaving airport staff, instead acting as if I was lucky to get the flight. Never again with this fraudulent and ruthless company! Aussies deserve better.

### "Virgin did not transfer all details"
Not Verified |  My booking required a change to flights due to medical reasons. Virgin did not transfer all details which meant that bags needed to be checked in at the line. The line literally did not move for half an hour. I was told they were not short staffed, they were just busy. Staff were generally helpful, however, considering this wait was due to the airlines error I was quite upset. If you call to change flights make sure they actually transfer all your booking details.

### "Useless staff and business management"
Do not fly Virgin post covid! They will cancel flights, delay flights all day and not accommodate or compensate you. Useless staff and business management. Have had a few trips booked in with them over the last few months and have lost over 50 hours of airport delays/cancelled flights and $1000 on rebooking flights. We will never use again.

### "I don't recommend this airline"
This was me and my wife traveled with Virgin Australia. We spent $760 on tickets and took us 6 hours to Perth and no one ask us for a glass of water. We have to call a staff for a glass of water and one of the rudest staff I've ever seen. I don't recommend this airline to anyone. Wifi signs are displayed but there was no network. You can imagine sitting for 6 hours no water how hard it will be. Will never ever using this airline in my life.

### "cancelled flight"
Adelaide to Melbourne. Virgin cancelled flight after asking passengers to wait in the lounge for over two hours. They announced the flight would be boarding 15 minutes before the flight was cancelled. They stated the reason for the cancellation was due to weather conditions but it appears the pilots had exceeded their flying hours. If it was the latter, they could have notified passengers earlier, enabling them to fly with other carriers (which still flew that evening).

### "they were unaccommodating and uncaring"
Not Verified |  Virgin Australia has scammed me. They offered me a credit, $800 however I can’t even use it as they no longer offer flights from the US. When I asked if they could somehow transfer it to Virgin Atlantic or make it so my credits are actually usable - they were unaccommodating and uncaring. Thanks for “crediting” me when I can’t even use it.

### "impressed how efficiently the staff handled the situation"
The flight left on time which was impressive given how busy the airport was. I was impressed how efficiently the staff handled the situation. The staff were friendly and helpful. The food offered (for purchase) was small and only water, tea and coffee were provided free a charge. This was no big deal for such a short flight. Overall a pleasant flight.

### "They should have served something more substantial"
Check in was easy and quick. The flight left on time. The staff were mostly friendly and helpful and the seat was very comfortable. My only criticism was the meal. It was a very small salad served with some cheese and dry biscuits. They should have served something more substantial on a flight of over two hours. The wine that was served was very good however.

### "complaint to Virgin requesting a refund"
Not Verified |  Flew with Virgin after visiting my terminally ill mother. The plane from Perth to Kalgoorlie was honestly the oldest, clunkiest sounding plane I've ever flown in. It was a high-30's day and uncomfortably hot - after a big day's travel I was looking forward to getting some air con on the final leg home. Boarded the plane and it was like an oven in there. I took my seat up the back and immediately tried to adjust the air con to blow on me, but it wasn't working. I noticed other passengers around me doing the same. The air con did not operate  during the flight and I was so hot I felt like I was going to vomit. I brought the issue to the crew's attention, one lady said she would 'look into it for me' and never came back. Submitted a complaint to Virgin requesting a refund (NOT full) and they declined it saying 'they got me to my destination safely'. As I exited the plane I noticed that at the front of the aircraft the air con was working - it was cooler up there.

### "Unhappy with customer service"
I am disappointed with Virgin Australia and Webjet, its booking agent, for refusing a full refund of airfares after cancellation due to medical reasons. The Covid19 and Virgin Australia in Receivership in the last two years resulted in no flights. However, about 35% of our fares was refunded, the rest was retained as travel credits. On 6/03/22 we submitted a booking request for 2 return tickets to Cairns in August 2022 using our flight credits. Now more than a month, there has been no flight confirmation from Virgin Australia despite an email request why there's delay, we might miss out. Its disgusting that the Airline did not cancel our flights when we requested a month before flight departure date. It waited until the day of departure to cancel a tactic to justify its policy of no refund. The fact is, we did not cancel our flight at the last minute. On the other hand if the Airline refused a full refund and we've now ask for a flight booking why now a problem? Are people with flight credits treated differently? Unhappy with customer service.

### "Enjoyable flight"
Enjoyable flight. Check in was busy, but I did not have to wait very long. Staff were friendly and efficient. The plane was very clean. It would be great if they offered more food options though. The plane left on time, but there was a bit of a wait picking up luggage. Overall I was satisfied.

### "doesn’t really do what it promises"
When you pay double economy and are promised a premium experience, Virgin doesn’t really do what it promises. Check in line was long with none travelling business class. It was so slow that I went to economy as it was faster. No premium through security. Only one gate agent so it was confusing that premium had to basically cut the line. On board was lovely, nice staff, full meal (I had a poke bowl) but the Mainland pre packaged cheese crackers cheapened it, surely a bread roll is nicer, plus there was nothing sweet (a mini Kit Kat would have sufficed). Luggage was the most disappointing as it took nearly an hour to arrive. Longer than the actual flight. Five flights were sharing the same luggage belt. I think they need to lift their game to ensure they deliver the premium experience they promise.

### "All in all an uneventful flight"
I checked in early via self check in and dropped my bag off easily. We boarded about half hour late but being a short flight it didn’t matter to me personally. Boarding was split into front and rear boarding. Full flight. Seats a little cramped but ok for this short hop. Coffee and tea were served free and entertainment can be accessed via their app. All in all an uneventful flight. My bag took about half hour to arrive.

### "sitcom airline, but I'm not laughing"
First time flying Virgin Australia since their financial demise and bail out. It's hard to tell what Virgin Australia is trying to be now, it's certainly not that much cheaper than a 'full service airline', and flying it today reminded me of why spending that bit extra turns flying from a chore to something enjoyable. The quality of the seat and cabin were poor, the seat offered no support and was cramped. No food of course, and that's fine. But does the cabin crew have to walk up and down offering over and over? The plane was ready on the tarmac on time, but the crew were running 30mins late. With people lined up to board, they announced the delay. (I noticed at a nearby gate, the Virgin crew were among the last to board the flight too). The pilot's landing was hard, a drop from the sky rather than a smooth glide. On arrival, the cabin crew announced departure of some rows by the back doors. A few minutes later they said forget that, everyone out the front door. There was a collective groan in the cabin. It appeared there were no staff around to operate the stairs for the back doors. Finally the male cabin manager looked asleep and could barely say anything to departing passengers, while one of the hosties blocked departing customers while she was cleaning business class already, only to fall over into an Economy X row and complain how late they are. A sitcom airline, but I'm not laughing.

### "The staff were pleasant"
Unfortunately the flight was delayed by 40 minutes. Otherwise. I enjoyed the flight. The staff were pleasant and well organised and apart from the late departure it was a good flight.

### "A pleasant flight"
A pleasant flight. It departed on time and the staff were very friendly and efficient. Apart from tea , coffee and water which were complimentary, all the food had to be purchased. It would be nice if they bring pack the "happy hour" for free drinks.

### "not allowing me to keep a seat I paid for is downright unfair"
I have never not had an issue with Virgin. Avoided for years but this time my partner and I booked a flight to Cairns. However, my partner had to fly earlier in the week. As there is no option in the online book in to relay this I thought I’d do the right thing, not check in and get to the counter early to let them know. I assumed foolishly that as I had paid for two seats, I would still get allocated two seats and have the one next to me empty! No, because I had not checked in online all the aisle seats were taken and I was squished on my own in a middle seat! Their policy does not allow refunds which I am reluctantly forced to accept as a standard rip off by airlines but not allowing me to keep a seat I paid for is downright unfair. I loathe unfairness and will continue to boycott Virgin airlines wherever I can and urge you to do so too.

### "Cannot remember flying this route on schedule"
Cannot remember ever flying this route with Virgin and being on schedule. Staff are always great but 30min late and still sitting at the gate in a fully loaded plane.

### "it has gone to the dogs"
Worst airline ever, if this how they treat gold members I hate to think how they look after non-members. These flights were booked first back in May 2020, and we travelled in January 2022 in total had the flights changed 10 time and ended flying via Brisbane in both directions. After check in Virgin tried to charge $65 for my daughter to enter the lounge (despite she is the family pool) so we had to split up out family if we wished to use the lounge which was absolute rubbish. Flight to Hamilton Island were Ok, but the returning flights can only be described as awful. As we checked inn, Virgin tried to charge us $200.00 for two bags been a total of 3.5 kg over the 23kg weight despite we were 58kg in total under after much agreement they told they would waver the charge. As soon we boarded the plane, I noticed the 4 passengers in front of had removed their mask and that were they remained until we landed in Brisbane and they all walk about the cabin with no masks on and not once were they ask by the cabin crew to put the on this is absolute reckless and dangers in a time of a pandemic. Again, we had to split up our family at Brisbane and the flight was delayed. At Sydney airport as we tried to leave the plane we were told to keep a safe distance of 1.5 as we left the plane but as my wife tried to get her bag from the overhead Locke a passenger pushed up agents her, I aske him to give her some room but instead he pushed her into the seat a walked passed her we were sitting in row 3, so this was in full sight of the cabin crew and nobody said or did anything expect my wife which was very upset but the cabin crew said or did nothing. At the bag carrousel we got the last 5 bags despite we been priority. Then to add insult to injury when I checked my air miles and they had not been added and when I was told that if was 14 days since the trip and could not claim the air miles (despite the fact the website said to wait 14 day before following up on missing air miles) I have been flying with Virgin for more than 20 years and in the last 28 months it has gone to the dogs.

### "Appalling transparency in regards to cancellation policy"
Appalling transparency in regards to cancellation policy. It states 'Choice' flight type can be cancelled for travel credit, but does not say anywhere on the page where you choose your flights that this travel credit only lasts 12 months, after which it is no longer valid and ends up as a 'donation' to Virgin Australia. After spending more than half an hour on the phone with a call centre agent, I'm directed to the 'Finalisation' page (right before making your payment) to the checklist of 10 things including Terms and Condition, and a few other links, where there is a specific link to "Future Flight Credit" highlighting that it only lasts 12 months. Then after further argument about this lack of transparency, the agent continues to respond like an automaton about being sorry that I did not read it, and whether I want to cancel the flight. After all that, she proceeds to cancel the flight. I find out then that the 12 months validity is from the time of cancellation (or issue of credits) rather than from the date of the flight (which is in advance of a month from today) and that I would have had an extra month of validity had I cancelled a day before or up to 2 hours before the flight. At this point I ask if I should just do that, to be told repeatedly that it is not possible as the cancellation has already been processed. At this point I lose my temper and ask to speak to her manager. I am now 45 minutes on the call. She puts me on hold for another 3 minutes. Then the same person comes back on the line to say she has spoken to her manager, and the cancellation has been voided, so I am now able to cancel closer to the date. If this was able to be the case, why was I screwed over in the first place and it refused until I lost my temper and asked to speak to the manager? This is an appalling booking and cancellation policy reliant on opacity rather than transparency, what a disgusting business model. Unfortunately it is one of 2 airlines available for this flight, so recommendation for choice of flight is less relevant, as the alternative is significantly more expensive.

### "Absolute disgusting behavior"
Cancels the flight 1 day before, moves it to a flight that doesn't suit us and ruins our international trip, we have to book and stay in a hotel and fly on the next day. They don't want to refund money to the card! Just gives it to some credit bank which is valid for 12 months only which doesn't work us at all as we don't fly that often. Absolute disgusting behavior.

### "staff were friendly and efficient"
My flight was due to leave at 8.40 am but was rescheduled for 11.40 am. I was already on my way to the airport. I understand how tough times are for airlines but I wish more notice was given. I was stuck at the airport for the whole morning. The staff were friendly and efficient and it could have been a lot worse. I wish they would offer a greater variety of food to purchase, especially given it's a lunchtime flight.

### "Boxing Day flights cancelled twice"
Not Verified | Boxing Day flights cancelled twice in 24 hours, 3 days before departure - completely unreliable doubtless due to penny pinching new owners. Joke of an airline rapidly descending into bankruptcy yet again.

### "attendants were friendly and efficient"
A good flight. Staff at check in were friendly and helpful. The plane left on time and the flight attendants were friendly and efficient. There was a reasonable selection of drinks and snacks to purchase, which was fine for a short flight. No IFE, but  that was not necessary in a flight less them 90 minutes.

### "no customer service, no recovery"
Flight cancelled, no customer service, no recovery, flight they rebooked us 14 days later to go home!! Got an earlier flight through other help. I was on the phone waiting for an hour. Food is average. Staff were nice.

### "they were rude, dismissive and obnoxious"
Not Verified |  Cairns to Brisbane, VA788, 18 July, 5.40, 7.55pm. The ground crew arrived and had missed one flight and was unable to get the barcode checked in to work, the male person was rude and told me to go back downstairs to check in - even though I had been waiting for him until the flight was nearly fully boarded. He then chose to ignore me then referred me to another staff member who gave me a boarding pass then reprimanded me by saying don’t expect it in the future as this was a one off, they were rude, dismissive and obnoxious and I will never fly with Virgin again.

### "get a text saying flights cancelled"
Not Verified |  Booked a flight home on that date about 4 pm then at 10.30pm get a text saying flights cancelled and they transferred me to the 6.00 am time, Thats fine but i had a hire car, they dont open until 7am. I tried to ring Virgin to get the flight put back to a later time. They had no one to talk to about it, they open at 5am i was flying out at 6am and i had to leave the hire car at a service station. To me not having someone to talk to is pathetic by them, ok I got it done but the stress levels went through the roof that should not have happened.

### "Such poor hospitality"
Not Verified |  Requested an escort for my dad as he doesn’t speak English. They said they’ll sort it out in 30 mins. 5:30 rolls around still nothing, I went up to the desk to ask what’s going on they said they’ve only just got around to do so. 6:00 rolls around still nothing went up again to. They said that they’ve had a last minute change of plans. Which is understand able. Which tick me off was that the escort came in without saying hello or sorry for the wait. She just went and said “let’s go” in real harsh way and proceeded to walk so fast she ended up 20 metres ahead of dad felt like she didn’t want to help my dad. For my understanding if you’re an escort for a passenger you’d stick close to person and leave them chasing after you. That happened right in front of me, I can’t imagine what it was like for him after he went through security. I hope that lady’s older relatives didn’t get treated the way she treated my dad. Such poor hospitality and customer service

### "Absolutely shocking customer service"
Not Verified |  This airline is an absolute joke. Was at the airport at 4.30pm on 27th June for our flight to leave at 6.10pm. We waited in line for 2 hours so obviously missed our flight. There were no other flights going to the Gold Coast that day so we ended up taking a later flight to Brisbane and had to hire a car to drive to the Gold Coast from Brisbane. There was only one staff member checking people in. Absolutely shocking customer service and will never use this airline again.

### "don't page people any more"
Awful customer service. Was waiting to board. Had to go to the toilet and came back. Found the flight closed and nobody in sight to even help. Was quite shocked as no one called me. Apparently they don't page people any more. No customer service at all. I fly quite frequently and had never had this happen before.

### "They are reducing a joke of a food service to nothing"
Not Verified |  I have booked a flight with Virgin Eco X, from Gold Coast to Perth. I got an email saying from 25th March 2021 they no will be longer serving a complimentary snack! These snacks are an insult anyway with a biscuit done up to look like something decent. Now they are saying you have to ask for the "snack" if you have prepaid the higher airfare. Seriously! What a joke. They are reducing a joke of a food service to nothing - I bet there are no reductions in airfares with this reduced service! I'm sure they will blame it on Covid. Wake up Virgin or you will go under when people vote with their feet. Pathetic.

### "the service was efficient"
Melbourne to Newcastle and return. Very smooth check-in and boarding procedures in both directions. The services operated on time, the service was efficient and a small snack was served on both flights. One way was on Velocity points (no trouble booking), and the return was at a very competitive fare at a convenient time. What more can you ask for? Well, slightly more legroom and a lot less rude security staff at Newcastle airport. I have never had a problem with my all-plastic no-metal belt at any other airport worldwide, but a self-important agent treated me like an idiot when his machine beeped.

### "never fly with Virgin again"
Not Verified |  I will never fly with Virgin again. I had to decide at the Brisbane airport not to go on a trip to Perth due to recent border changes for covid. Virgin service desk was not helping me out as I booked through the travel agent although I was at the airport service desk in person trying to get the ticket credit at 2 hours before my departure time. I told her I didn’t have enough time to contact my travel agent in such a short time frame. She falsely reassured me that I don’t need to worry about it and my travel agent could help even my departure time has passed. But instead she didn’t do anything and Virgin marked my ticket as “No show” and “used ticket”. Now my travel agent could not rebook for me. Virgin refused to reopen the ticket for me and accused me that I was “No show”.

### "Disgusting service"
Not worth the inflated flights. Don't trust them during COVID! We just tried to change a flight that's coming up in 2 weeks. It took multiple calls over multiple days to even get through to the queue! You go through all the prompts, then it says "please call back later. Despite their website advertising free changes, after waiting 3.5 hours (no exaggeration) on the phone, we were told we could change to one of the multiple flights on the day we needed. And only the most expensive one. The equivalent flight on Jetstar was $135, on Virgin $177, yet they said that for a change, we could only book the $290 tickets, departing approximately an hour later. Disgusting service. We ended up paying more than the tickets were worth. Will avoid flying them again at all costs. Furthermore the process to change the flights took almost an hour after the 3.5 hour wait. Previously, we tried to change a flight online using a travel credit. When using the credit, we could only book our Brisbane to Melbourne flight with a stopover in Sydney. When we removed the flight credit option, the flights are direct and at a cheaper price.

### "has made us not want to fly again"
Family of 4 traveled from Gold Coast to Melbourne on Monday 4/1/21 on flight no VA 750 at 6pm. While we were in the air, we had 20 minutes of severe turbulence which made my kids petrified and sick. It was so scary for me and my family that has made us not want to fly again. We have been to the Gold Coast every year on a different airline but had never experienced this turbulence. I would never fly on or recommend Virgin again to anyone. I did mention to one of the flight attendant when disembarking but she abruptly said it was wild weather.

### "an absolute disgrace"
Not Verified |  Virgin Australia are an absolute disgrace! I had a flight booked for Monday 21st December 2020 from Sydney to Gold Coast. As I am sure you are aware, Queensland borders were closed to NSW residents on the 19th of December meaning it was impossible to fly to Gold Coast from Sydney unless having a valid exemption which I did not. You advertise on your website that we can cancel the flight and get flight credits. For 2 days solid I call your number you provided to cancel (136789) to which every time its a voicemail saying you have a high number of calls meaning nobody can speak right now and to call back at a better time or do cancellation online. But every time I do it online it says the only way to cancel is by calling you on 136789 which again I did for 2 days straight and nobody was taking calls. Please tell me how can I cancel my flight if this is the process you have in place??? It's completely misleading and scamming people. I also called the 3rd party saying all cancellations must be made direct through virgin but again, you simply wont let people do and are scamming them. From returning from my week away, I called yesterday spending an hour on hold and eventually somebody picking up. Again couldn't do anything, says i need to go on website etc and dont forget I already did this for 2 days solid previously letting you guys led me in roundabouts. I then asked to speak to a manager to which she says she will transfer me through to the help desk. Basically was on hold for another while until somebody else answered asking why i was calling. After repeating my story again this person could not help what so ever obviously leaving me angry and frustrated and after expressing this and how I felt she hung up on me after been on the phone for 90 minutes. The processes you guys have put in place meaning you are misleading customer’s by putting processes in place that are not accessible whilst also taking their money to which your website says you can get flights credits etc.

### "The crew was friendly"
Quick and easy check-in and boarding. The seats were a bit tight, but as the flight was less than full we could stretch out. The crew was friendly, and a snack of biscuits and fruit juice was served. The flight operated about 20 minutes late.

### "ripping off your top paying customers"
Not Verified |  Pre COVID (and Bain) I loved Virgin - easily my domestic preference. Flew business post COVID and was just so sad now at what the penny pinchers are doing. I was paying top dollar for full price business class - there is no lounge, no separate boarding, and honestly don't bother serving a cookie in a box - save your dignity and just serve nothing. Qantas, who will now get our business, has lounges open and proper service. I get Virgin was bankrupt, but I don't understand how blatantly ripping off your top paying customers is your solution to recovery. What does a beer or wine and high quality sandwich cost you from a $1500 ticket? Get some marketing folks in fast before the accountants destroy you. No inflight, no wifi - for business in 2020.

### "avoid having to give people cash refunds"
Not Verified |  I had 14 flights canceled by airlines because of Covid. 13 gave me cash refunds. Virgin is the only airline that refused! They hid behind the travel agency I used and tried to tell me it wasn't their decision. Now I have a voucher I don't want because they canceled the flight I did want. My understanding (not 100% sure this is true) is that they hid behind possible bankruptcy to avoid having to give people cash refunds they were otherwise be required to give. I assure you I will never patronize any of your companies ever again.

### "Why no tea or coffee allowed"
Not Verified |  Cairns to Brisbane with Virgin Australia. Got told no tea or coffee due to covid regulations, when we flew up to Cairns Qantas happily served it. Could not access entertainment either? Why no tea or coffee allowed, only water? Everyone told to board together.

### "airline of last resort"
Flew Cairns to Brisbane business class with Qantas. Lounge open, hot meal. Then Brisbane to Sydney with Virgin (Qantas business sold out). No lounge, no meal, no explanation. If QF can do it why not Virgin? No wonder we see Virgin as airline of last resort.

### "Cabin crew and ground staff were very lovely"
All four of us got our ticket upgraded to Business Class and I have to say, I’m really pleased that we paid the extra $1200 for it. Cabin crew and ground staff were very lovely. The Virgin Australia lounge at Brisbane is very well laid out and has a huge variety of food, drinks and nibbles to choose from. On the aircraft, the seats were very comfy and had excellent leg room. The seat pitch was also pretty good too. Virgin’s IFE system definitely trumps Qantas’. Virgin have a large selection of movies, TV shows, games and music to choose from. Make sure that you have the Virgin Australia Entertainment app on your device. On Qantas’ IFE system, they have only released premiere movies which certainly isn’t bad, but those are the only movies that they have. I only had a a small problem connecting to the inflight wifi at first but other than that, the system worked beautifully. I definitely recommend Virgin Australia to be your next carrier across the skies.

### "Staff were amazing"
Melbourne to Perth. Staff were amazing! A big thank you to the cabin manager of this service who allowed me to upgrade to business class for free and gave me the opportunity to speak to a first officer of the airline! I would recommend Virgin Australia any day for amazing service.

### "This was the most annoying saga"
This was the most annoying saga. We were originally booked on direct flight from Ballina to Sydney on 20 March on VA1142. This flight was cancelled so we had to call VA Philippines contact centre and it was re-booked on 03 April from Ballina to Sydney. This flight was cancelled then we had to call again and was told that there was a flight on 27 March from Ballina to Sydney but it was fully booked what was the point to tell us? Finally they offered us to fly to Sydney on 04 April on VA524 from Coollangatta(Gold Coast QLD) to Sydney. Good trick as we had to cross the border from NSW to QLD and the border was closed. We had to obtain a permit to cross the boarder which we got. The flight VA524 was very basic because the Cabin Crew incharge just told us that you guys on the same boat as them, it meant that we won't get any food for lunch. Dont forget we upgraded to Business Class and paid extra. The check in agent did not mention that there would be no service in business class. Baggage collection was quick in Sydney.

### "had to demand a refund"
We booked and paid for Business Class from Sydney to Perth direct for 5 April. It was confirmed and got the seats. It was supposed to be VA559 A330-200. This flight was cancelled by Virgin 1 day after we booked and paid. They sent us an email and told us that our flight would be Sydney-Darwin-Perth. This was also cancelled the next day by Virgin. They re-booked us on Sydney-Melbourne-Perth. This was also cancelled the next day. Then they re-booked us on Sydney-Brisbane with lay over for 5hrs 45 minutes then from Brisbane to Perth. This was ridiculous as the day before, we had driven to Queensland, we could have easily kept on driving to Brisbane airport and spent the night in Brisbane, this would have saved us the cost of accommodation and the cost of business upgrade from Coollangatta to Sydney flight. We faced the real possibility of being quarantined in Brisbane for 14 days then how on the hell we got home to Perth. We cancelled ourselves the flight from Sydney to Perth and had to demand a refund which was promised to us in 3 weeks we should receive the refund. Virgin Australia yesterday (10 April) sent us an email refusing the refund and offering and giving only Future Travel Credit in a form of Travel Bank. As if we will ever fly with Virgin Australia again.

### "service was satisfactory"
Not Verified |  Our booking was originally booked on VA570 departing at 22.55 from Perth with A330-200 on 8 March. We travelled and booked business class to use the flat bed seats however when we checked in the beginning of March, our flight was changed to B737-800 and we did not receive a notification. The reason we booked this flatbed A330-200 was because we had a flight booked to Ballina next day on 09 March at 13.35. After we rang VA Call Centre in Philippines, they re-booked us on VA562 (A330-200) departing Perth at 15.30 and arriving Sydney at 22.40. It meant we had to book 1 night accomodation in Sydney. The service on VA562 was satisfactory. Baggage collection in Sydney was quick.

### "This is awful service"
Not Verified | Orlando to Sydney via Los Angeles. Our flight to Sydney was cancelled due to the travel ban and instead, we were assigned a flight to Salt Lake City. Because we booked on the Travelocity website, Virgin won’t answer any of my questions about cancelling. They just refer me back to Travelocity. Meanwhile, Travelocity doesn’t know Virgin’s cancellation policy well enough to answer any of my questions including basic ones such as “Will I at least get a travel credit? When would it expire?” But Virgin charged my credit card and should know their own policy. I don’t get it. This is awful service! I am already devastated that my dream vacation is cancelled and now I have an uphill battle to get refunds.

### "useless customer service"
Not Verified | Extremely useless customer service, I had a flight booked with them for my (probably once in a lifetime) vacation to Australia, (I live in Canada) they cancelled my flight from, so not only did I have to spend and unexpected $650 to rent a car and drive 6 hours to get me from Gladstone to Brisbane so I wouldn't miss my flight back to Canada, The only thing they are willing to offer me is a $90 credit off my next flight. Which by the way is a complete waste of time since as you can imagine, Virgin "Australia" doesn't have any flights in Canada. Thanks Virgin.

### "Virgin are not refunding"
Hobart to Sydney booked for the end of May 2020. Virgin are not refunding even though they are cancelling or changing the flights, and do not respond to complaints submitted 2+ months ago! You cannot trust this airline.

### "don’t give refunds"
Mackay to Brisbane. Virgin Australia don’t give refunds even though cancelling is not our fault. The person I spoke with talked that fast I couldn’t understand her and when I asked her to repeat what she said she was rude. What I can understand is I have fare credit that I have 12 months to use so if this virus goes on longer than that we lose our money. I have no idea how to access this credit they need to be reported for lack of customer service.

### "What a waste of time"
Not Verified | Brisbane to Christchurch. Ever tried to contact Virgin during the virus. What a waste of time. Is my flight still flying? Who knows. Virgin phones do not work. They will not take calls anyway unless you are flying in 48-hours. By 48 hours before the flight, all the other airlines are sold out. What a joke. Try contacting them early. Still, no good they are working Australian business hours if the phone answers at all. I think my booking will be cancelled for the second time but I do not know. It is in 4 days. I pity other people stuck in another country. When there is the real trouble with this airline you are stuffed.

### "disgusted with the service"
Sydney to Adelaide. Pretty disgusted with the service. We were 3 minutes late for checking in and they wouldn't even budge, flight still had 27 minutes until it left, then they tried to charge us $500 for a later flight, high way robbery, totally agree with paying extra but seriously $500, this must be how they make their money. Clearly we have to go as we had a death in the family but no compassion what's so ever. Will never fly with virgin again. When they could of just said no worries you are 3 minutes late but we will help you out - nope $$$$$ is all they are interested in.

### "attitude of the staff was really awful"
My wife and I travelled on VA0595 from Hobart to Perth on the 16th March 2020. We were really disappointed that there was not enough food (snacks) on the aircraft which was not even nearly full except for some Asian rice dish. The cabin staff were very perfunctory and short when we asked about the options open to us, the attitude of the staff without exception was really awful. Then to crown it off once we were airborne and the (snacks and a drink) dispensed with the lights were dimmed, the cabin crew retired to the galley and held a raucous and very loud get together which was punctuated with shrill voices and loud raucous laughter which obviated any thoughts of a relaxing evening flight getting into Perth after 12:00am Hobart time. In short, their behaviour was unprofessional and very larrikan with no regard to the comfort of the passengers. What a pity that Virgin has had to resort to this poor quality of personnel to service their flights.

### "They are unscrupulous"
Not Verified |  Brisbane to Cairns. Virgin Australia has managed to skewer us for 700.00 Canadian dollars and they did it with ease! As a result of the world issue with Corvonavirus we had to return to Canada on short notice. We called Virgin Australia numerous times while still in Australia and could never get through to customer service and their on line page is awful, more interested in up selling. Their web site indicates if you booked through an agent they have to cancel. Our agent couldn't contact them either. They are unscrupulous and not a company worth dealing with. I cant imagine Sir Richard Branson approves of this or maybe he does?

### "cannot board as the gate is closed"
Melbourne to Sydney . My flight was scheduled to leave at 4pm and I was on a different gate and upon hearing the final boarding announcement I reached the counter at 3:52 pm. I was told by the staff on the counter that the flight has left. I told her that it was to leave at 4pm so how come it left early. Then she corrected herself and said that I cannot board as the gate is closed and pointed me to the help desk on level 1. I am disappointed with the poor customer service as they greet you with straight faces and they are not there to help.

### "I am so impressed"
Los Angeles to Melbourne. Best flight I have ever been on. This started our honeymoon to Australia. We sat business class and felt like royalty with our own flight attendant. I have multiple food allergies and they were so helpful and accommodating. The seats were comfortable and the overnight bag made our slumber even more luxurious. I am so impressed with VA and would recommend it to anyone flying overnight.

### "thank you to both of those ladies"
Not Verified |  We were flying home from Hamilton Island on Sunday 08/03/2020 but when we got to the airport to find out that I had actually booked the flight for Monday 09/03/2020. 2 Virgin Australia workers (Shelby and Amy) in Hamilton Island helped us out with no questions asked. They got on the phone and arranged new flights for myself and my partner to get on both flights on Sunday 08/03/2020. Have to say a huge thank you to both of those ladies for the wonderful work they did for us yesterday.

### "greeted very frostily"
Wellington to Melbourne via Sydney. Booked a return trip from Melbourne to Wellington which was the cheapest at the time however, the catch is you have to fly to Sydney with only an hour layover. They were late in taking off and arriving and had a staff member pick up 11 passengers to take them directly to the gate for their connecting flight. That went without a hitch and lucky no one had check-in bags to pick up or the luggage was flying thru or got transferred. The flight headed to Wellington was also slightly delayed. That's 2 delays thus far. On the way home, we were more than 30 mins behind schedule and because we checked in bags this time we had to clear customs and check bags in again. Upon arriving at the desk at 10:15 am for an 11 am flight I was greeted very frostily without any apologies and was advised with minimal explanation that I had missed my flight, it wasn't due to leave until 11 am, and that I will be on the next flight which was at 12 pm. This took a further 15 mins to organise and again without explanation she takes off somewhere. When she comes back she coldly asks how many bags and I respond 2 and she proceeds to ask me to rip off the old tags. There is one more tag and she snaps that off. The whole experience has been horrendous the moment we left Wellington. I understand delays and they happen all the time and to various airlines. What is unacceptable is that sort of treatment especially when they were delayed by 30 mins which meant we missed our flight, to begin with.

### "worst customer service"
Melbourne to Queenstown. This is the worst airline I ever taken. They are a nightmare. I missed my flight because of their rude, lack of care and un-empathetic ground staff. So my flight was at 10.30am and I was at their counter at 9am. After checking-in, they told me that I have 2 luggage and they overweight. I can only check-in 1 luggage and they are over-weight. To add additional bag of 23kg is $150 (min 23kg) or $120 for 1 luggage up to 30kg. So, I went to the side to remove some item which is just nearby from their counters with seats. When I am done meeting their weight requirement and combine 2 luggages into 1, I left my carry-ons at the seats on went to the check-in area in which they want me to bring my carry ons along. So i walked back to the seat to get my carry ons, then they walk over with my luggage with the smug face and tone to tell me that my luggage is my own responsibility and throw it back at me. Then proceed to tell me the gate have closed I cant board the flight already. I told them we still have 40 mins to the flight, they say they have already closed the gate. I say I never even heard the gate for boarding and they dun even have the courtesy to assist me or advise me that the gate is closing when I am just nearby. Plus i have already checked-in. Normally, for other airlines they will look for the missing passenger that has not board the flight but check-in. They simply ask me to go book another flight and even told me I should have come to the airport 3 hours before the flight. Seriously, this airline only cares about making money but take care of their passengers. Really, worst customer service ever, or they do not even have customer service to begin with.

### "Extremely disappointed"
Adelaide to Melbourne. Extremely disappointed in Virgin Australia. Booked a return flight with my wife after travelling for a wedding and once boarding the plane we were disembarked due to engine trouble. This is fine in itself but to put us on a plane 11 hours later when we have a a 16 month old at home that doesn’t have a babysitter after 4pm when there was 4 flights going to our destination after us with Virgin Australia that apparently had no room. We were then told to book with another company at our own costs as each of the 4 flights after us had been over booked and very little chance of accommodating us. This has now put us out $1200 and the response from the manager was sorry that’s not our problem. I guess this is just a case of a big company taking advantage of the consumer once again.

### "one of the best I’ve flown yet"
Not Verified |  Sydney to Hobart. It was one of the best I’ve flown yet, the reason is that they provide great snacks and it was a fast 2-3 hour flight, I’ve flown the same route before with Qantas and Virgin Australia offered great service and everything was fine expect for the return flight which was delayed for 20 minutes.

### "very caring and courteous"
I was traveling to Sydney from Adelaide for a funeral for a day and I hadn’t realized that I mistakenly had purchased the wrong date for my trip (the 29th of Feb. instead of the 22nd). With all the worry for missing the funeral and feeling so foolish for my mistake, the manager of Virgin kindly helped me. I couldn’t have gone to the funeral without his help and kindness. Even though the flight was packed and about to board, they changed my round trip ticket without a charge. I’m forever grateful. The staff were very caring and courteous.

### "no major dramas"
Brisbane to Newcastle. Flight was okay, no major dramas. Landing into Newcastle was terrible! We came in rocky and fast, just before landing the pilot took us back into the air, second landing was hard, rocky way fast. Left everyone in the plane a little shaky.

### "a very pleasant flight"
Melbourne to Sydney. An early morning flight to Sydney. Check in and boarding were fine and the plane left on time. The staff were friendly and the coffee and juice they served was fine. A very small snack was provided, that didn't match what Qantas would offer on a similar flight. Overall a very pleasant flight with Virgin Australia.

### "Lack of communication"
Cairns to Hobart via Brisbane. Can’t really say good service. I thought you get what you paid for. Virgin is a bit expensive compare to Jetstar so I thought it will be better but I was stunned with a service they have. The lady took so long to check us in we got there an hour before our flights but they had an issue with our flights and they don’t explain at all what’s going on. When she was done with what God knows she was doing she just gave our Boarding Passes with only 5 minutes to spare to go through inspection and security and jump into our plane so you can imagine what kind of rush we did. Also, they didn’t let us know that our luggage will be delayed so we stand like an idiot waiting in luggage collection just to find out it was in the next plane. Lack of communication and care for customers.

### "service very bad"
Not Verified | Bali to Sydney. Never ever fly with Virgin Australia, the service very bad! Always delayed! Flight last night at 11:55 pm and get canceled! And this morning they said depart time 7 am, we wait inside the bus for 30 minutes and they sent us back to the terminal during another delay! I recommend you never ever ever choose this airline even tho it is cheap!

### "Flight was ok, pretty average"
Not Verified |  Auckland to Brisbane with Virgin Australia. Flight was ok, pretty average, was on time which was good and nice short flight. A bit disappointed that we weren’t offered any food for our 3 year old whom we had to pay a fee for. Not really fair for her to watch us eating. To make this worse the favoured option was gone by the time we got offered food as well as all drink options apart from tea and coffee, this was just because of seating. The male flight attendant was quite rude as was one of the female attendants, not being rude directly to us but about other passengers as well.

### "encountered an issue with Virgin"
Brisbane to Melbourne. Recently me and my husband had encountered an issue with Virgin Australia. It was while we was flying with flight VA 334, during that time the flight was scheduled for 2:55 pm but it was delayed for more 1 hr 7 min and reschedule for 4:02 pm. During the check in process one of the staff told me that we won’t be able to board that flight as the flight is ready to take off and ask us to get a new ticket for another flight so we did. So, while we were waiting for our new flight at that time they were announcing the boarding of the previous flight. Just wanna be clear regarding this matter, was it fair enough pay for the new flight tickets?

### "an excellent flight"
Sydney to Perth. Virgin Australia is currently flying B737-800 on the East-West route which is not as ideal for a 5 hour flights. The aircraft has seen better days, and Virgin Australia needs to increase its fleet sizes and upgrade its aircrafts asap to remain competitive against Qantas. Platinum passengers are entitled to 4 free upgrades each year on domestic flight purchased on Freedom fare, which is what I had done here. The leather seat has ample of leg room and fairly wide on a B737-800. It also has an in-seat plug so passengers can charge their devices inside the aircraft. This is however not available on the economy class seat which I hope VA will include a USB charging port in its newer fleet. On an evening flight, we were served lunch/dinner menu curated by Virgin Australia in house chef Luke Perry. The food is well prepared, and the cabin crew is outstanding, with top notch service for business class passengers. The crew keeps me hydrated throughout the flight. Limited inflight entertainment but on an evening flight, I decided to take a quick nap. Overall, an excellent flight with excellent services.

### "Velocity is simply a waste of time"
Virgin Australia (VA) touts their Velocity frequent flyer programme as award-winning and internationally acclaimed. I am a Platinum Velocity member and have had that status for two years. As a frequent international business traveller, Velocity simply doesn’t stack up, and the claims Virgin makes are pretty bogus. VA is a small, domestic Australian airline with virtually no international routes. It is not a member of any of the major alliances, and that is unlikely to change. VA is in financial dire straits (so can’t afford alliance membership fees), and its owners will not allow it to join an alliance that will cause direct competition to aforesaid owners. So when you fly internationally, even as a high status Velocity member, you will not have access to any of the benefits normally afforded to high status members of StarAlliance, OneWorld, or SkyTeam. That means if you fly economy or premium economy (as I mostly do), when you fly internationally, even on an airline that has a formal alliance with VA, you will not have lounge access abroad, quite often won’t have access to priority boarding, and cannot ever use flyer miles or status credits to upgrade. And as mentioned, when flying abroad, at best you will be on a VA partner. Never on VA itself. It then becomes even more complex: if the flight is booked directly with VA or the partner airline, there might be exceptions to these rules. If the flights are booked through a travel agent, you’re completely excluded from enjoying any benefits usually accorded to high-status frequent flyers. On top of that, VA has no lounges at any of Australia's international departure points. They buy access to a 3rd party lounge called The House (where the service in my experience has been pretty awful). But on a recent trip to China, flying a VA partner (Hainan Airlines), departing from Melbourne I was not able to get access to a lounge before departure - even as a VA Platinum member, flying a VA partner, and while in Australia. In addition, as a VA Platinum member VA provides 4 Business Class upgrades a year. Good luck trying to use them! Despite the frequency of my travel, I am able to use 1 or 2 a year at most. The T&Cs are so complex, and so clearly designed to make their use impossible, that the offer of upgrades to high status flyers should be regarded as misleading. I’ve communicated these issues to the Velocity CEO. It’s made no difference at all. Why bother? So if you are contemplating throwing in your lot and restricting your travel to one or other of the Australian airlines in order to avail yourself of the benefits accorded to high-frequency travellers, go with Qantas. Virgin’s Velocity is like Virgin Australia: a rinky-dink minnow pretending to operate in the same space as the behemoth that is Qantas. Virgin’s Velocity is simply a waste of time.

### "a dire choice in Australia"
Melbourne to Sydney. Virgin is such a dire choice in Australia. Firstly, my flight was delayed citing bad storms in Sydney. Apparently, the three other airlines had not heard this news. But, the fun begins before then. The airline blocks out the first 60% of the plane well before check-in so you have not much choice on seating. And then once you're about to board the ground staff ensure they make anyone who is not a 'Priority' member feel like second rate citizens. I've not encountered much friendly staff on board a domestic flight in ages. Then there's the catering. Don't pretend you're a full-service airline when an 0715 flight involves a tiny granola bar or apple. The flight home was during the complimentary drink service (1700-1900 as opposed to QF which has free drinks on Cityflyer flights after 1600). I asked for a Pirate Life beer, being one of the three options they have on offer and was advised "you can have Carlton Dry for free". A - it's not on the menu, and B - it's a pretty dire beer. This was accompanied by an, admittedly, nice dip. I also note that rather than hand out the little bottle of wines (menu price $10 or $14, again compared to QF which sells wine for $6), they offer a glass from a bottle of Hardys wine which retails for about $8 a litre at most bottle shops. On the positive side - they have good entertainment options. But, If you can't go on Qantas just go a budget airline and get what you pay for.

### "surprisingly comfortable flight"
Melbourne to Auckland, evening departure scheduled for 6.55 pm, departed about 20 mins late as the airport was busier than usual. Ground services were good, very quick to get boarding passes and bags dropped, staff friendly and approachable. Boarding was a little bit slow, possibly as everyone was desperate to board. Onboard the aircraft was clean and tidy; the seats on these aircraft have a purple leather seat cover with different coloured headrests. To the front are 8 business class seats, partitioned off with a small glass panel. We were seated on the right in 20 D, E and F. Rows 13 and 14 have a wider pitch, as these are the emergency rows, but VA charges $50 extra for these. On the seats in front, there are 4 USB charging ports; on our aircraft, one of these didn't seem to be working, a minor inconvenience. The seat pitch on this aircraft is 79cm, which is 5cm (or two inches) more than Air New Zealand and 7cm more than Jetstar. The comparable flight on Air NZ does not include baggage, meals or entertainment, the VA fare (which was the cheapest we could find) does include 23kg of checked baggage plus 7kg carry on. Interestingly an announcement was made in the terminal that Jetstar would be checking the weight of carry on. Previously we have been stung extra dollars in this way. Entertainment is via an app that you download to your device and then connect to the wi-fi. This offered a small variety of movies and TV programmes, more than enough for a 3-hour flight. Also, on this return flight, the aircraft had satellite internet connectivity, and they offer a free 15-minute connection, enough to message your friends to let them know you're on your way. Hospitality was excellent, the flight crew were all male, except for the cabin supervisor. Complimentary water offered shortly after departure, followed by meal service. There were three choices, two hot (noodles and chicken parmigiana) and one cold option. We all selected the chicken dish, which was surprisingly tasty. Unlike other airlines where you have fruit, a bread roll, and cheese and crackers, the VA meal is a larger portion and no other items. Passengers were offered one complimentary drink such as beer, wine or juice and a tea or coffee; extra drinks had to be purchased. Overall this was a surprisingly comfortable flight and I would happily recommend Virgin Australia.

### "The meals tasted terrible"
Me and my wife flew to Perth on the 1st of January. The meals that they served us on the plane were simply inedible. The meals tasted terrible. They looked terrible. After tasting them, we handed them back to the hostess, we were just unable to eat them. Virgin should be ashamed of themselves for serving such terrible food, on one of Australia’s longest flights. Next time we fly, we’ll give Virgin a miss, and fly with Qantas instead.

### "completely and utterly hopeless"
Canberra to Adelaide via Sydney. 3 flights in 2 days & all of them late by significant margins. No explanations. Sit and wait! Very typical of my ongoing experience with Virgin Australia with 19 in 20 flights significantly late?. What’s wrong with this airline that they can’t get schedule right? How can they compensate me for time lost with my kids (not that they offer) because I have to leave a day early in order to be sure of getting to meetings on time or am late returning and not home in time to be with them. All because of Virgjn’s inability to fly anywhere close to schedule. Just completely and utterly hopeless. Then there’s the cut price catering at a full fare price, few reasonably modern amenities like USB charging ports, smart arse crew, the list goes on. All that compounded by what I think is poor customer support. No empathy nor comprehension of the impact of poor operations. Fly Jetstar in Oz. At least you’re paying cut price and understand it is what it is, not pretending!

### "enjoyable and memorable"
Nadi to Melbourne. My family and I had a pleasant and memorable from Australia to Fiji and back via Virgin airlines. The price was excellent, the seats were comfortable, the free food and drinks were great the flight attendants were courteous and friendly. Best if all one flight attendant rendered us from the flight over to Fiji on our return trip to Australia a week later. She was very sweet, natural and helpful and helped make our trip very enjoyable and memorable. Thank you.

### "ignored me completely"
Brisbane to Sydney. I was skipped to be said thank you from the crew, even I said to her and she said to other passengers she ignored me completely. It might be small thing but I was not treated properly. I often use Virgin Australia for domestic flight, but I am not fan of Virgin Australia anymore. I was wondering why its so difficult to say just thank you.

### "glad the flights were over"
Nadi to Melbourne via Sydney. Easy check at Nadi. Leaving for Sydney was prompt. Paid for economy x seats, definitely recommend as Virgin uses domestic planes. On this route to Sydney, there were USB ports low under the armrests of the seat in front, better than they offer ex Melbourne. However, you have to use your own device. As before the meal, although tasty, was very small, I had Chicken Parma. No rolls or dessert. My advice BYO snacks. Only one drink run. I bought water at Nadi airport but as your bags are searched prior to boarding they will pass the sealed bag (yes just with water) after this procedure. We arrived 50 minutes early into Sydney but weren’t given the ok to land so we circled all this time. On landing, we had to wait about 15 mins for a gate which meant we missed our connecting flight. You have to get bags after clearing immigration and rechecking at the transfer area (well marked). We were booked on the 10 pm flight which was packed. There was this guy in front of us who was watching Bollywood on his device without headphones. The FA told him twice not to do this without headphones but that didn’t stop him and I think the FA gave up after twice. We arrived in Melb at 11.30pm, tired but glad the flights were over.

### "professional and courteous"
Cloncurry to Auckland via Brisbane. My memory of Virgin Australia being an average airline is far from true. Both planes were immaculate and flights on time. Cabin crew professional and courteous. IFE was receptive and wifi worked well. Meal is slightly above flight standards.

### "full price for a budget service"
Melbourne to Nadi. We booked economy x tickets and very glad we did although in Melbourne we did not even board early. Our “dedicated” locker (row 13) was already full by the time we got to it and we were the only two seated in that row. Disappointingly Virgin uses domestic planes for this 5 hr flight, so economy is tight. Glad we didn’t travel business as there were a lot of unsettled babies down that end. We left on time. You had to rely on your own device for entertainment which hurts your neck after a while. No points to recharge. Food was very minimal, I had the pumpkin pasta which was very tasty but tiny and that’s it. Nothing else. I did bring some cheese and crackers plus chocolate which helped. They seem keen on selling food on board - and that is wrong for a $3000 return flight for the two of us. I feel gouged. Landing was fast and hard but on time. Not too impressed with Virgin as they are charging full price for a budget service, Struggling airlines need to up the ante not drive passengers away.

### "praise the staff"
Not Verified |  We have used Virgin a few times in the last month and cannot praise the staff for being caring and compassionate. I fly to Sydney every 6 weeks to pick up our daughter and grandson and fly back and they are impressed how good they have been. I previously used jetstar and found them not good at all and not happy.

### "Poor customer service"
Perth to Sydney. I booked a ticket for one of our staff through a 3rd party booker. When she went to the airport for the flight she was told that there was no flight for her, despite her showing the confirmation papers with booking number for both Virgin and the 3rd party booker. Virgin made her pay for another flight at the gate. I am trying to get a refund as we are not paying twice for the same flight. The Virgin Customer Service team can now find the original booking but cannot find the new booking they made her pay for at the gate. This has been going on for 2 1/2 months and I am getting no resolution from Virgin. Poor customer service.

### "extremely dissatisfied"
Not Verified |  Sydney to Cairns. I have never before encountered worse customer service quality or greater incompetence from an airline. I had no problem with any other airlines in Australia except for Virgin airlines. While travelling with my family from Sydney to Cairns, Virgin Australia lost one of my family member's bags and were unable to track it and could not return it until several days later (after promising that it would arrive first thing the next morning). On the way back from Cairns to Sydney, our flight was delayed 5 hours and we were not notified by email or text, as the contract promised. Since we had international connecting flights directly after our flight from back to Sydney, we could not wait 5 hours do to an aircraft issue and tried to get Virgin Australia associates to help us get on an earlier flight. However, they were very unwilling to help us and told us that it was up to us to negotiate with the airlines for our other flights. We had no option but to cancel our Virgin flights and buy flights from another airline going to Sydney. At the time, the Virgin associate we spoke with told us she would organise a refund for our cancelled flights. Now, Virgin Australia is refusing to provide documentation for our flight cancellation, making it very difficult to get refunded for a large amount of money that we had to pay because of them. Further, Virgin was unable to transfer our luggage when we switched flights, so they told us they would send our luggage directly to our final destination. However, it has been 4 days and we still have not received our luggage. I am extremely dissatisfied with this airline and I would not recommend it to anyone traveling in Australia.

### "Will never fly with Virgin again"
Brisbane to Launceston. Worst experience ive had with an airline. The service was horrible. I upgraded my ticket to have flexibility in changing my flights at a $30 fee each time as i have had to change my flights several times. This upgrade cost $150 and still cost me over $600 in change fees as this upgrade was a waste of money, changes still cost over 180 each time. Changed the time to my flights with no communication and were very unwilling to help. Will never fly with Virgin again ever.

### "will be deeply disappointed"
Not Verified |  Brisbane to Sydney. If you are in an emergency and need help from Virgin Australia to get to your destination sooner, you will be deeply disappointed. I booked a flight with the airline to visit my aging parents, but received an urgent advice on the day that my father was dying. I went to the airport earlier and sought assistance from the airline to see if they can get me on an earlier flight. I told the airline staff at the service desk that my father was virtually dying and need help. She was helpful and immediately went into the office to seek advice from her manager. However, after waiting for at least 15 to 20 minutes, she told me that they can only put me on an earlier flight if we pay an additional $500 for my flight from Brisbane to Sydney. I understand the fare rule for economy class that changes are prohibited. However, it is mostly disappointed that airline (or at least the manager on duty) did not consider providing any compassionate assistance. It is totally acceptable to ask a loyal customer to pay an additional $500 when he was caught in an extremely difficult and sad circumstances.

### "Really bad experience"
Melbourne to Gold Coast. Really bad experience with this company. I've just got my luggage but is really damaged. After that I have been to the baggage service to report what just happened but nobody tried to help me, rather with a lot of nonchalance they said that Virgin Australia doesn't cover luggage damage. I'm really disappointed and for sure I won't fly anymore within this company, thanks

### "I'm dreading flying home"
Brisbane to Perth. I wish to complain about the service I received while attempting to board our flight Christmas Day 2019. We accepted the offer from ground staff to board early only to be stopped at the aircraft door by an extremely rude member of staff. I was forced to sit on the plane door edge to catch my breath. The staff member still refused to acknowledge the seriousness of the situation. Only after the intervention of one ground staff did she appear to care as she was caught out being so nasty. At this point she pretended she had no idea I was ill. For a company that portrays itself as caring and customer focused, this was very poor. Leg room in row 27 was appalling. I'm only 160cm tall and I was cramped. My partner is average height and his knees had to go either side of the chair in front. An awful experience and I'm dreading flying home.

### "hidden and excessive fees"
Melbourne to Christchurch. Okay service and cabin standards spoiled by cut price airline tactics, with hidden and excessive fees. Qantas or Air NZ are better options in the Australia/NZ region.

### "lack of leg room"
Sydney to Hong Kong. Terrible staff, rude and confrontational. After complaining about lack of leg room in row 27 was told Virgin Australia has the best economy leg room. I spent 7 out of 9 hours standing due to the lack of leg room. I would advise anyone considering using this airline to find an alternative if possible.

### "has not delivered on what truly matters"
At the Brisbane Virgin terminal, priority check in was quick and there was also a priority lane security check. However, what is the point of priority boarding gate entrance when all you do is go into the same queue as everyone else? There was no priority boarding for business class except a difference boarding gate entrance. On board, each business class passenger had a bottle of water and was offered sparkling wine or water. The plane was again a 737 despite being the last flight of the day. Seats are uncomfortable because I was forced into a slouch position when the seats are upright. Inflight, no tablets or earphones provided to business class (downgrade from before). The only saving grace was the inflight service. Dinner was a 3 course meal. A starter, main and dessert. The dishes were outstanding, especially the cheese platter. Upon arrival, this flight was the only arrival in the entire Virgin domestic terminal but the baggage took some time before it went on the carousel. Overall, Virgin business class offers good food and service but my reason for flying business is to be comfortable in my seat and Virgin has not delivered on what truly matters.

### "Absolutely terrible service"
Not Verified |  Boolgeeda to Perth. Delayed flight once again from Boolgeeda, they don’t inform you of why and how long. Absolutely terrible service from this airport. At least inform people of why we can’t take off and keep people updated regularly. I wouldn’t fly with Virgin Australia if I had a choice. Virgin need to pick their game up and be upfront with people.

### "business class is a total rip off"
Perth to Brisbane. There was only 1 priority check-in opened and despite the growing queue, there was no attempt to open another counter. At 90 minutes to departure, business class passengers were made to continue waiting even though there were 2 passengers who obviously had a lot of trouble and needed dedicated time. I looked over at economy and it was absolutely packed. Having said that, the counter service was pleasant. Next hurdle was security clearance. The queue was again long and slow. Apparently multiple groups are flying today but again, only one security lane was opened. After an explosives test, I finally managed to get into the lounge, which was largely empty (thankfully). The lounge was good with simple food selections. When boarding, I had priority boarding which was good. The plane was a disappointing 737 even though it was the red eye. The seats are simply wider than economy, but no TV built in. The recline was also bad. When upright, the seat forces me to slouch and is very uncomfortable. There was a black bag for take away, which contained an eye mask, ear plugs, a packet of tissue, lip balm (improvement) and socks. The lip balm is an improvement from before. After the rest of the plane boarded, we were offered sparkling wine or water. The menu is again basic - soup for supper, muesli and yoghurt for breakfast. Too bad, no cheese platter on the overnight flight. Apparently, the plane offers free Wifi entertainment. There used to be ipads and earbuds provided to business class in this situation but no longer. Supper was soup - which I did not get. I asked for Tawny as my night cap, but there wasn't any. The toilet was clean, despite economy class passengers going under the partition belt to use the toilets. Overall, Virgin Australia business class is a total rip off from the check in counters to the planes. Flying business does not give more comfort than economy class.

### "Worst customer service ever"
Worst customer service ever! I flew with my 1 year old daughter from Hong Kong to Sydney, asked for flight attendants help to put luggage up for me, I'm only 1.5metres tall. Asked for 3 times no one willing for help! But they just told me this is my own responsibility to put luggage up and down the overhead! At the end, when I was putting luggage up and my 1 year old daughter left unattended on the seat by herself, she fell from the seat, hurt her nose! They advised me to put away my carrier into overhead because it causes other passengers in risk while departure, but they allowed 8 pillows on one seat unattended, and advised me no security policy against pillows, even 8 of them. Security policy is only against passengers’ belongings. They don’t really use their brain to understand the policy to protect passengers .. attended photo of pillows on the seat

### "Worst on-time record"
Not Verified |  Sydney to Melbourne. Never again. Worst on-time record. But it is the lying about it that gets to me. Take your bags, check you in, send the bags down the chute, and only them tell you it’s delayed. Them it is always half the real time. All while 2 later flights with capacity overtake you. I’m over it. Back to Qantas which isn’t that much better, I know. But I give up.

### "worse than a budget airline"
Not Verified | I paid $420 one way to fly to Sydney. Very poor service for a huge 1.5-hour flight. I’m sure Virgin Airlines can provide more than a bit packet for the passengers who pay such massive price for a one-way ticket. What are you trying to save? The snack packet is only a quarter packet. What a shame. You can provide a much better snack. This is worse than a budget airline. I fly with you guys whenever I can the reason I paid six a huge price expecting some better service

### "Eventually they offered a refund"
Not Verified |  Avoid Virgin Australia. I Booked 3 flights from Auckland to Sydney over the phone. The agent gave me a total cost of $500, an excellent price, under the pretense of a "happy hour deal" (agent's words). After confirming two times that all passengers were included in this $500, I made the payment with my credit card. The next day $1000 was taken directly from my card. There was no email, phone call or attempt to notify me of a price increase. I did not give this agent permission to charge $1000. I called this morning to dispute the price. First phone call, I explained my situation, was put on hold for 5 minutes then hung up on. The next call was 74 minutes long with most of it on hold. Apparently the agent had given me the wrong price. I questioned their inability to notify me of a price change and happy our deal. Virgin Australia used the excuse that I should have known $500 was a ridiculous price. They also danced around the happy hour deal as it was clearly made up by the agent to mask his incorrect pricing. Eventually they offered a refund but that still doesn't make up for the time and money lost booking a flight even closer to Christmas. Refund may take 3-5 weeks so now we're $1,000 poorer this holiday as well.

### "have gone downhill"
Melbourne to Sydney. I’m a platinum flyer with them and have chosen them for years over Qantas. They have gone downhill over the last year or so. The crew are always polite but the planes are getting a bit past their sell-by date. We had a 30 minute delay on our luggage in Sydney and it was only brought to their attention that it hadn’t arrived when I enquired only to be told it had already been delivered! They are bordering on a budget airline so don’t expect any bells and whistles if you are up the back. Lounges are ok but pretty awful at peak times with dishes piled everywhere. WiFi rarely works on the planes. I’m not swapping anytime soon as I am platinum but sometimes it’s tempting.

### "lack competence and integrity"
Sydney to Melbourne. Virgin Australia is to be avoided at all costs. They lack competence and integrity. My flight from Sydney to Melbourne is 50 mins it took this airline 7 hours and 47 mins with delay after delay after delay all of which miscommunicated with false revised times update with 30 min intervals. Further I could have driven to Melbourne and arrived at the same time. The same Qantas flight arrived on time in 52 mins. The airline has no care for its passengers and do not provide what one pays for, I did not pay for a 8 hours delay.

### "staff are extremely rude"
Townsville to Melbourne via Brisbane. Very expensive! $800 bucks for a domestic flight that was delayed both ways at every possible point all 4 of them. The plane was very dirty smelt like a toilet. The free WiFi doesn't work period. The food was a very small portion. The staff are extremely rude. Luggage was handled with no care.

### "Virgin is a budget airline"
Sydney to Bali. We booked virgin as we thought this was a full service airline. How wrong were we. Travelling with one infant and a toddler I knew this was not right when we had to catch a airport bus to the plane. Seriously, a 6.5hour flight in a 737? Also despite allowing me to pick a kids meal and infant meal when booking (I have screen shot) I was told on the plane that Virgin does not carry kids or infant meal for this route .. why give the option to select. We were given row 12 where the seats dont recline both ways which is Crazy. Apparently we were the only ones that did not pick seats. Additionally only one soft drink is free additional soft drinks has to be purchased. I believe Virgin is a budget airline despite claiming it is not. . IFE is none existent due to the aircraft being a domestic 737

### "is becoming a budget airline"
Not Verified |  Every time I fly Virgin they offer less and less service (i.e the meal comes by itself and not with snacks, there is one complimentary drink and if you want a second that is not tea, coffee or water you must pay). The WIFI across mainland Australia is iffy at times and the entertainment selection has significantly decreased. On that note, the Boeing 737-800's do not have TV's on the back of screens, which means a portable electronic device must be used, except the seats do not offer USB chargers either. The crew are still extremely helpful, it seems that Virgin as a whole is becoming a budget airline. For short flights (MEL-SYD, SYD-BRIS etc.) this would not be an issue, however any flights from WA to the East Coast you just expect a little bit more (like what they use to offer circa 2015). It's a shame Virgin used to be considered a full service airline.

### "was no refund for my ticket"
I booked a connecting flight from Melbourne to Hong Kong transferring in Sydney. After having to wait 30 minutes to drop my bag at the Melbourne airport, the staff told me that gate already closed. Luckily, there was one staff who helped us jumped the queue,dropped our luggage and urged us to run to the gate. Another nightmare began when I landed in Sydney. When I got to the international transfer desk at Virgin Australia, the staff stopped me from getting on the shuttle bus between terminals and said "there is no way I can make it. She said she was gonna help me and asked me to wait, which I dumbly believed her. Turns out all she did was just asking the staff to take my luggage off the plane and tear my boarding pass! She refused to book another flight and made a ridiculous suggestion for me to catch a cab to "try to make it", after stopping me to get on the shuttle bus in the first place! There is an express train that only takes 3 minutes to get to to the other terminal (I was unaware of that then) and I still have 20 minutes left before the last call when I reached the transfer desk at Virgin Australia. The staff claimed that I have sufficient time to get on my connecting flight as there is 50 minutes between the landing time and the boarding time, dismissing the fact that it took 25 minutes for them to get the passenger off the plane once it landed and that the shuttle bus comes between 20 minutes of interval and takes another 15-20 minute to get to the other terminal, not to mention the time to go through security. After telling me that I were to pay full fare for another flight and that the next flight to Hong Kong would be the day after, they did not offer any other suggestion to me. In the end, I had to book another flight to Hong Kong from another airline and wait an hour just to get my luggage. There was no refund for my ticket.

### "Was very disappointed"
Was very disappointed with this flight I paid extra for economy x but really all I got was more leg room the meal was very average no tea or coffee offered and when we were quarantined we just sat with no real information for about an hour. I flew to Australia on a different airline and have to say I got more on that economy flight than what I received on virgin. I think now I have made my decision which two airlines I will stick with now and one will not be Virgin. Wifi also was not good I couldn't even watch a movie after downloading app so luckily I had taken a book.

### "Worst decision I have ever made"
Not Verified |  Perth to Hamilton Island via Sydney. Worst business class I have ever flown on any airline. Advertise sleeper seats and you get an old aircraft with no entertainment and a seat that has a maximum 2 inch recline. Two of us flew from one side of Australia to the other at a cost of $7000. Food was bad but service was acceptable. They advertise you will fly in business class pods and this is the second time I have been caught. Never again. I was a Qantas regular but thought I would give Virgin a go. Worst decision I have ever made. My mate laughed at me when I said I was going Virgin business class. I’ll bet I never get a response from them.

### "not a nice experience"
This Morning I caught the 6am Virgin Canberra to Sydney flight and it was not a nice experience. Starting with check-in, the line was slow and long with no option to self-check-in. Eventually they called those who needed priority due to the flight departure time. They had also switched me out of my chosen seat and I no longer had a window seat as per my preference. From there it continued downhill. The flight attendant announcements were unable to be heard and in general not particularly friendly. The dash 8 seats were low with no neck/head support making them uncomfortable for the average 5’9” person. The worst most uncomfortable part of the entire flight was the aircon. In addition to the self control valves there was vents above every second row. Unfortunately this was above my row. It was set on high speed with a very cold air temp (maybe 15-18). This resulted in me shivering the whole way to Sydney and gave me the stiffest neck as it was blowing onto my neck, shoulder and face. My lips were completely dry and sore when we arrived. Lastly, The service was basic which was expected but I couldn’t even enjoy the tea as it was way too strong. This was the worst I’ve ever felt on a flight. Luckily it was short but I will try avoid taking this service again.

### "all in all, it was ok"
Canberra to Melbourne. Check-in and bag drop was efficient, nice to actually deal with a person. Boarding was on time, but it was a mess with people pushing shoving and cutting in. Who knows why. We boarded from both back and front which I think is a great idea. I hate having to use my own device to watch anything, it smacks of cost cutting and gives me a sore neck, juice and water, no hot drinks. Plus a revolting dip (cashew and sweet potato) with a couple of crackers. We know Virgin is stingy so we ensure we eat beforehand. The seats were tight (it must be horrendous if the person in front reclines). Just so glad it was a short flight. Took us about 10 minutes to get to our gate on landing but all in all, it was ok.

### "Thank you to Virgin Australia"
Not Verified |  Mackay to Brisbane. As someone who requires a wheelie walker to get around, can only walk for a short distance and cannot walk up stairs, getting through an airport and boarding a plane seemed impossible to do. Yet, I was treated with respect and understanding and my fears were allayed. A wheelchair was readily available on arrival at the airport and the lift made it a breeze boarding the plane. The staff at the airport as well as flight crew ensured all my needs were met. Thank you to Virgin Australia for assisting people with mobility disabilities to participate so easily in air travel.

### "short trip which was a positive"
Melbourne to Canberra. I chose Virgin as the availability of times were best for me. Boarding was both from the front and rear. I like that as it is more efficient. The plane departed on time. Seats seem very narrow, thin padding with no seat back entertainment. We were told we could only have juice or water (no coffee/tea) and were given a very tiny muesli bar. All comes across a bit mean. However it’s just a short trip which was a positive.

### "Thanks for nothing"
Brisbane to Perth. My trip started pretty pleasant with the ground staff who assisted us with every possible way he could since we were running late (God forbid Brisbane traffic!). Things took a different turn from then. Cabin crew did not greet you nor seem like they wanted to be there. Food choice was limited, butter chicken or pasta. We ordered one each and they were terribly dry and cold. The attendants never got me the drink that I ordered. My point was proven when one of the customers expressed his disappointment to the attendants in a vulgar tone that turned many heads. Wifi was not available as promised although I tried every steps on their instruction card. I guess it’s the customer phones that refused to work then. The flight back to Brisbane was even worse when a ground staff lady acted like her colleague is too dumb to help me resolve my check in issue. Food was provided with the same choice. Only catch is that one third way down, you were forced to eat pasta since they ran out of chicken option. Otherwise you can try landing at midnight and go home and cook what you want, which was what I did since the pasta was basically inedible. What a good way to finish your leftover stock Virgin. Had it not been a reward ticket, we would honestly never fly with Virgin. Thanks for nothing.

### "Incredibly poor service"
Gold Coast to Melbourne. Incredibly poor service, breaching their own safety standards. Virgin forced us in a seat next to someone too big to fit within their seat, meaning that we could not put down our arm rest and resulting in my partners back being hurt. Staff ignored their own ‘put your armrest down’ requirement. Staff ignored our request for support and didn’t even try some basic compensation, like a drink. For your own sake, avoid.

### "unhelpful, lack compassion"
Sydney to Darwin via Adelaide. I missed my flight by a minute, the ground staff were hands down the most unhelpful, lack compassion, rude and acted like it was all very inconvenient for them! Now I wanted to sort out where to go and what to do, with no help from the ground staff I find my self at the service desk with a saving grace of a lady who assisted me. But to be honest the staff on Virgin overall were a joke and rude I’ll never fly with them again.

### " forced my family to split up"
Brisbane to Hamilton Island. They forced my family to split up because they made a mistake promising a seat to another guest. Putting people on the spot with no empathy. Baggage drop is also the worst experience I ever seen long queue with lack of staff presence. Absolutely avoid for the price you can pay to another airline.

### "Happy to keep flying with Virgin"
Melbourne to Brisbane. I made a last-minute booking with Virgin after my flight (from another airline got cancelled). I then realised that I couldn't make this Virgin flight, so I called up and changed it to two days later. The operator said that because I had booked with Virgin earlier that day, that for one time only, she would disregard the fees associated with changing flights. Happy to keep flying with Virgin!

### "poor quality of its food"
Brisbane to Adelaide. Virgin won't win business class flyers with the poor quality of its food. Flight departed 10.05 arrived Adelaide 1.35. Lunch seems warranted. A refreshment was served choices being worst quality smoked salmon I have ever seen and very small in fact mean quantity. Option was tasteless arancini. Service pleasant enough. No liquor offered.

### "no help from staff at bag drop"
Not Verified |  Melbourne to Sydney. Absolutely disgusting service. Was absolutely no help from Virgin staff at bag drop at Melbourne domestic airport, had to use kiosk again, with no offered assistance from staff. Flight was delayed 1 hour, missed my daughters quinceanera. Not happy Virgin Australia. This is getting out of hand. At this point I’m going back to flying Tiger airways.

### "not given a blanket or pillow"
Paid over $1,200 for Brisbane to Bali return in October 2019. This is the first international flight I have ever been on when you are not given a blanket or pillow. Of course there were no in built TV monitors for entertainment. There are only 2 toilets at the rear of the plane and for a 6 hour flight the line gets long. The food on the way to Bali was ok but on the way home it was terrible. You are only given water or soft drink in a plastic cup which is poured from a larger bottle. On the return flight two of the attendants were asleep in the rear seats visible to all passengers. I doubt whether I would fly Virgin internationally ever again.

### "never fly Virgin again"
Not Verified |  Sydney to Gold Coast. Arrive at Sydney airport. Chaos everywhere. People not knowing where to go. Not ONE support staff on the floor helping anyone. No where in sight. It was not during holiday period so really it should have been a seamless process. Will never fly Virgin again. Would it be hard to also have some lighting system in place so you know what counter is serving the next person? They have staff yelling out to the next person in line with their hand up. And then get on the plane and put down my tray and its dirty, so was my daughters. Pathetic.

### "Not a pleasant airport experience"
Not Verified | Adelaide to Melbourne. I'm really disappointed in the lack of assistance the staff of Adelaide Airport offered to me - as well as the staff of Virgin. I foolishly left a rolled up piece of native Australian Artwork on a seat outside of Gate 16. A beautiful souvenir that I bought in Darwin and one that I was really excited to hang in my home as a memory of my trip. I was a bit flustered while getting to the gate - as many are in airports, and as a consequence I left my souvenir on the seat. I realised this on the flight and when I landed in Melbourne, I first asked The Virgin staff to help me - which they refused, telling me its not their issue and to contact Lost and found. So I immediately contacted lost and found, only to be told that it will either be stolen or handed in. Even though I described to them exactly where it would be - after only an hour in transit - the women refused to send someone to check if it was there, claiming that is 'not part of their policy'. Really, how difficult is it to just check if somethings there or not? Its a darn shame that I left it there, but I'm also really saddened by the lack of support that Adelaide Airport and Virgin staff offered me. Not a pleasant airport experience at Adelaide Airport.

### "has wrecked my holiday"
Not Verified |  Cairns to Melbourne. Virgin Australia has wrecked my holiday. This is a surprise 19th for my best friend and she is afraid of flying so instead of putting us together we have been split up and placed at different ends of the plane. I should not have to pay big money for flights and not even get to sit next to my friend while we leave to go home. Disgusting from Virgin Australia

### "ripped off by Virgin Australia"
Not Verified |  Never will I fly with this airline again ... my first and last. This is the first time flying Virgin where I was asked to pay over 1000 AUD for a change in flight to an earlier flight time on the same day with the same airline! Incredible when I paid 440AUD for a return trip from Brisbane to Sydney. I’d be saving hundreds of dollars if I bought a brand new ticket. I wonder how many tourists and aussies have been ripped off by Virgin Australia. Shame on you.

### "anyone with any sense will only be a Virgin customer once"
My recent flight from Denpasar to Brisbane was one of the worst experiences of my life. Although I paid three times what I paid for the same flight only 4 months ago, (with another airline) the service, food, plane and experience was sub par to say the least. First we were informed that we had free entertainment. What they don’t tell you is that on an international flight you have to provide your own device as they don’t have televisions! They therefore advertise free wifi, but not that in order to access it, you had to have downloaded an app beforehand. Can you do it on the plane? Not unless you pay for Internet access. So not free wifi as promised. Food, would have been nice if they didn’t run out of the choices by the 9th row, and I was in the 11th! I don’t eat curry so no dinner for me. Can I have a cup of tea? Oh yes, someone will bring it soon. On disembarking I was still waiting for my tea! The plane? Noisy. It rattled so badly that we couldn’t sleep. With no entertainment it was a very long night. I never get air sick, but I was one of an epidemic of poor passengers who suffered on this plane. Goodness knows what was in the air but we were falling like flies. I could go on but suffice to say you get the idea. I will never fly Virgin again, and will now give up my velocity card as it is a waste of time. I will never use my points. I’m going Jetstar, not a great alternative but a thousand times better than Virgin, which must stand for anyone with any sense will only be a Virgin customer once!

### "don't wish this experience on anyone"
Darwin to Melbourne with Virgin Australia. 12.30pm flight back home changed to 7.30pm and again changed to 8.30, we had to re check in to the hotel for longer. We had to call the car rental service explaining our flight was very much cancelled and I'm sure I speak for everyone when I said 'I just want to go home'. I don't wish this experience on anyone, it's unreasonable and just bad. I hope Virgin Australia really doesn't repeat this behaviour.

### "rude staff"
Melbourne to Brisbane with Virgin Australia. Unaccommodating, uncooperative, and rude staff. In-flight meal" on a 2 hour 30 minute flight consists of a cookie and half a cup of black tea, and they probably don't clean their cabins very frequently either.

### "I enjoyed my flight"
Sydney to Melbourne. I enjoyed my flight. The staff were very friendly, efficient and helpful. There was no IFE , but that didn't matter for such a short flight. The wine served was great. My only issue was with the meal, the meat served was very fatty.

### "does the job consistently"
I have been flying Sydney to Melbourne route every two months for work for the last year or so and this flight typifies the flight experience I had with Virgin Australia. It very much feels like a bus coach service and I don't mean in a negative sense but that flying between these two cities is very common to the point of not thinking that you are actually flying but rather you are commuting to work. The boarding was the usual process of embarking from the front and the rear. The early morning flight qualifies for a breakfast of sorts with either a slice of apple and a hot drink or a ball of some kind of muesli mix with a hot drink. Both are not very filling. VA falls behind Qantas on this. There is not backseat screen on VA's B737 but you can use your own mobile device to watch IFE over the plane's WiFi. So, need to make sure you have enough juice in your phone or tablet and the VA's entertainment app. VA does not have enough widebody planes to fly this route except for east coast to Perth, which puts it behind Qantas again. But, for work commute VA does the job consistently and gets me there.

### "disgusted with the service"
My partner and I's flight was canceled from Sydney to Coffs Harbour for my youngest brother's 18th surprise party with a different airline. We were sent back up to check-in and were offered a refund or a seat on a bus for the same price as the airfares. Driving from Sydney to Coffs Harbour can take anywhere between 7 to 10 hours pending weather and traffic. We needed to be there by 6pm and it was now past 12pm. We walked to the Virgin desk who had the next flight out to Coffs where the lady sent us away and told us we needed to book online despite other people in front and behind us booking seats on that exact flight. Tickets at that point were about $200 each. In the three-minutes it took to find the flight and click pay, an error message of, "seats no longer available" popped up. There were now no other seats available on flights to Coffs from Sydney on Virgin, Tiger or Qantas. My partner went back over to Virgin where they had also since doubled their airfares and the same lady chipped they now only had three business class seats left for $750 each (for a 40-minute flight). So we would have to pay $1500 to get to Coffs one-way. This was an extremely important family event so we had no other choice but to foot the bill or miss everything. Having been a loyal flyer with Virgin since I was a child and now flying regularly for work, I was absolutely disgusted with the service. We didn't even get an apology.

### "the leg room is chronic"
Melbourne to Hamilton Islands on an old 737 which looked as though the cabin had not been cleaned in the economy section. Flight was 2hrs 45mins & this airline likes to pack in passengers like sardines as the leg room is chronic if you happen to be 6ft+ tall. It was dreadful even for this duration of the flight. Profits are before passenger comfort sadly & there is zero IFE unless you hook up to there App & drain ur phone. No USB port on the seat anywhere. Cabin attendants came round with snacks but weren’t the most friendly crew on this flight just went through the motions of thete service on this flight. The one good point was the free WiFi onboard which I used & was pretty good. I was glad to get off a very cramped seat & onto land. If the get rid of one row it would make a huge benefit for the comfort of the passengers in terms of legroom & for a more enjoyable flight experience.. but it’s all about profits as stated earlier.

### "didn't care about us"
Queenstown to Brisbane. Virgin cancelled the flight and left us stranded in overbooked Queenstown due to the weather, while all other airlines were flying the exact same route. They booked us on a terrible flight via Sydney with 3h stopover. I called Virgin 3 times to ask for a better flight and they kept telling me that they couldn't do anything. After a lot of frustration, I went online to find I could buy a direct flight from Virgin Australia. I called again, asking if the flight is full how come I can buy a direct flight from Virgin? A minute later they said, sorry sir, we can book you free of charge. Basically they didn't care about us. I will never fly with them again.

### Virgin Australia customer review
Sydney to Auckland business class. there is a priority check-in counter and we went to check in with the staff, only to get told we have to check in on the kiosk. We asked where about to hand in our duty free receipt to the customs officer, it is not a big problem that its out of her knowledge, but she was acting like everything is our fault. I have never seen any airline staff rude and impatient like that, not a decent single smile. The worst check in I have ever had - no matter what happened to her before, she shouldn't have that attitude towards customers we should be treated nice and fair. This review is just about the very poor check-in service.

### "repulsive customer service"
Not Verified |  What deplorable customer service from Virgin Australia after our recent flight from Melbourne to Queenstown. It was to be the beginning of the waste that was our snowboarding honeymoon. Not only did they lose both my husband and I's luggage for three complete days, all communication was one way. I called their offshore call centre mutiple times during these three days. This is in complete juxtaposition to what is promised on their website. They claim they will be in daily contact with you in regards to baggage delays. The phone support offered no assistance or information beyond what I could search online myself. They had absolutely no clue, which was evidenced when I received a phone call from Virgin five days after our bags were misplaced asking if we had received them, then sound surprised when I confirmed that we had. What an absolute joke! What makes matters worse, the only reason we received our bags was because I contacted Queenstown airport ground staff directly (not Virgin staff, as we were offered no local contact) who promptly located our bag within the airport and couriered it after hours to our accommodation in Wanaka. Massive shoutout to the Queenstown airport staff! Who knows how long they were sitting there for. For three days we were left in the lerch with no snowboarding gear, change of clothes or hope! Never again will I travel Trans-Tasman with Virgin Australia! There isn't even an entertainment screen for your 3 hour flight. I have contacted their claims department over a fortnight ago with no response. This has further fueled my discontent. What repulsive customer service. Thank you for ruining our honeymoon Virgin Australia.

### "Very poor service"
Sydney to Melbourne with Virgin Australia. This airline is budget. They gave me the most awful coffee and fruit? No actual proper food. There service at the counter was poor when trying to put items into my bag that was checked and I over booked one extra bag and was told no refund possible. Very poor service.

### "lack of consistency"
Brisbane to Townsville. Absolutely appalled by the lack of consistency in this company. I had my son, 7, fly unaccompanied with your airline. This was the first time by himself so I made sure I went to a travel agent to organise his flight as he was meeting his dad in Brisbane. (Dad lives in Mount Isa). Both the travel agent and your staff in Townsville said a Medicare card would be sufficient ID. So everything was fine and he boarded no problems to Brisbane. However on the way home your staff in Brisbane refused to allow him on the plane as he didn't have a birth certificate. He ended up missing his flight, and as a mother being told your seven year old is stuck at an airport which his father also has an outgoing flight that day made me panic as I was all the way in Townsville. Had the Townsville staff mentioned this I wouldn't have allowed him on the first flight as his certificate was damaged in the floods. So I completely understand protocol but they already broke it by allowing him on the first plane. Then the real joke was because my son's dad had to catch his flight they allowed my son's uncle to sign him onto the plane when I wasn't informed of this and signed a legal document that nobody but his dad can sign him in. So it baffled me that they can break a legal document but can't allow a Medicare card in which they already did. Brisbane staff were completely unhelpful and judging by these reviews other people have thought so too. Please get your staff all trained across the boarder so this stuff doesn't happen.

### "Complete disregard for customers"
Queenstown to Melbourne. Complete disregard for customers. A few hours before the scheduled flight time, Virgin Australia changed the flight time from Saturday evening to Sunday morning. No assistance or information given, so I had to scramble to find a last-minute hotel room in overbooked Queenstown in the middle of ski season. Next morning, arrive at the airport well in time to find out that the customs officers don't seem to have been informed and the security lane is closed. After a couple of hours waiting, they finally arrived and let passengers through, but the flight is further delayed. The lounge is closed. As a final straw, when I submitted my hotel bill to Virgin for reimbursement, they arbitrarily decide to reimburse a much lower amount that actually paid for the extra hotel night. Of course, not even a token compensation for the ruined weekend and now I am also out of pocket for the costs! Never again fly with Virgin (and I am a Platinum frequent flyer, but at some point enough is enough).

### "a most satisfactory flight"
Melbourne to Cairns. Hectic check in even on a Sunday morning in Melbourne and a short wait in the Priority lane to hand over bags etc. Lounge excellent with a great variety of food and drinks and then boarding which was done efficiently. Lots of young flyers and the crew were great with the little ones (not mine I add) seat 9C in the aisle but no window to the left. Seat and pitch ok but leg room a bit tight. After take off offered a warm snack and yogurt and some sort of granola bar along with tea..coffee..water etc. A few hours into the flight another drink and snack run. Landed in Cairns a little ahead of schedule and overall I rated it a most satisfactory flight and Virgin Australia have never let me down !

### "shocked by the attitude"
Brisbane to Nadi. My husband and I were checking in through self kiosk and we noticed that staff are busy talking within themselves - even when we asked for help they look the other way. Help comes a bit late. Then we go to the drop off belt, one of the staff approaches us about suitcase and how the stickers should be placed in the suitcase. When my husband said we were waiting and no one helps out, the staff instead told off my husband that ‘there is no need to be mad’. We are shocked by the attitude and rude comment by the staff who are supposed to be helpful and friendly. Even when we smiled at her she made a rude face. I did not expect that kind of attitude from the front line staff. There needs to be staff training on how liaise with customers friendly. Our trip got spoiled because of one staff of virgin Australia who has no idea how to communicate with customers. Thanks

### "ruthless, pathetic and condescending"
Not Verified | Sydney to Brisbane. Flight number VA958 on 6th September scheduled for 2 pm. Insufficient flight cancellation information was given, received a text message at 9.45am from the airline stating 2pm flight has been cancelled with next flight we had to catch was at 12pm. Tried calling customer services it rang for hours but had no answer. Had to wait at Sydney airport for 11 hours. Reached Brisbane airport after midnight took someone else's bag by mistake came back to the airport to drop off bag apologized. The customer service rep shouted even after apologizing for our mistake. I highly recommend not to use this airline they are ruthless, pathetic and condescending.

### "Always delayed"
Brisbane to Townsville with Virgin Australia. Always delayed. Zero communication. Terrible customer service. Pay a little more for Qantas and get a half decent service. Even Jetstar is better.

### "Customer service is non existent"
No more chances for this airline. Flew Brisbane to Queenstown return. Customer service is non existent. Enroute to Queenstown the by the time the fight crew got to my partner and myself with food options there were no vegetarian meals so we missed out unless we wanted to pay for extra food. Reroute back to Brisbane we managed to get an ok meal. The flight crew continued to miss us when doing the rounds for water on both flights and when we finally asked for a glass of just plan water, we were informed that we should have asked when offered and it is not available, instead we were directed to purchase a sugary soft drink instead. Flights weren't terribly cheap or comparative either.

### "I'll never fly Virgin again"
Not Verified |  Auckland to Perth. Terrible communication. I can accept flight delays due to weather conditions. But I cannot accept the fragmented, late or non existing text messages from Virgin keeping customers informed of flight status. One more thing, teach your flight crew that overpowering, strong, sickly sweet perfumes are highly offensive in small, closed in spaces ie. inside a plane. I'll never fly Virgin again.

### "worse than budget airlines"
Not Verified |  Melbourne to Sydney. Virgin Australia nowadays is worse than budget airlines as Jetstar and Tigerair. I travel for business very often and every time they either are late or it’s a technical issue. Why pay premium fee for services worse then low cost airlines.

### "In-flight entertainment limited"
I flew Melbourne to Los Angeles return and this was the first time I have flown Virgin Australia on this route. We didn't get food or a drink for 2.5 hours into the flight and when the meal did come they had only one option left. They serve the meal first then come back about 20 minutes later with the beverage service. The food portions were small and didn't taste great. In-flight entertainment was limited. You only get one drink with you dinner then another 10 hours later with the breakfast service. Otherwise, there is a jug of water you can help yourself. Cabin crew make multiple annoying announcements throughout the flight - four announcements for what the meal options were. Seat was comfortable and we departed on time and arrived early. If you get super cheap flights go for it. Otherwise, spend a little more for Qantas. I actually find American and Delta offer a better product than Virgin Australia and around the same price.

### "on par with budget airlines"
Brisbane to Proserpine in April 2019. For a full service airline they are on par with budget airlines like Jetstar and tiger air. Both flights were delayed by 20+ minutes. Ground staff were unfriendly and quite rude and moody. Flight attendants seemed a little nicer. You get a drink and small meal for the whole flight and my meal was cold. The free wifi worked amazingly which was a plus. No entertainment on the back of the seats but you do get access to the virgin entertainment app where you can watch movies etc. (not much choice tho). Overall virgin didn’t ruin our trip but they certainly didn’t help either.

### "I was very disappointed"
Not Verified |  Brisbane to Perth. I was very disappointed in my Virgin flight. To begin with I would have to say this was the worst crew I've ever flown with. The safety was appalling ... seat in front of me was in recline position during takeoff. First time I've not seen crew check seat belts and seat position of passengers before takeoff. Staff rude and surly .. male crew member even rolled his eyes when asked if reclined passenger could put their seat upright during dinner service so I could drop down my tray. Never again. I was travelling home from a conference which had a focus on customer service. I suggest Virgin review their training and implement measures to correct this poor service .. it costs very little to be greeted with a smile and helpful attentive attitude.

### "efficient and friendly"
Canberra to Melbourne. I enjoyed my flight. Take off was punctual and service was efficient and friendly. There was no IFE, which didn't matter given the length of the flight. Food for a full-service airline was too small, however. Just a very small muffin. Not great even for a short afternoon flight.

### "a good flight"
Not Verified | Melbourne to Canberra. Overall a good flight. There was a delay taking off due to the congestion at Melbourne Airport. There was no IFE, but that was no big deal given it was such a short flight. It was, however, available via an app. Service was very efficient and friendly. Even though it was a short flight it's a pity they didn't offer something more substantial than a very small muesli bar. Not much for a full-service airline.

### "IFE needs way more options"
Auckland to Sydney via Melbourne. Since I checked in online, it was just off to passport control and security which was quick and efficient. After a speedy Lounge visit, it was time to board. It's great to see priority boarding being enforced as this process can be chaotic and when passengers from economy just rush to the door and no one lines up properly, utter madness. The crew onboard were very welcoming and they offered pre-take off drinks with options including coffee, orange juice, sparkling and still water. Once airborne, the meal service started but since I ate in the lounge and it was a 6:30 am flight I opted to rest and enjoy the IFE with the occasional coffee and water during the flight. Snacks were offered during the flight, a nice touch when you feel like something sweet. The seats in business class were comfortable enough for a trip across the Tasman but anything longer than 4 hours would not be sufficient or good value money. Overall, departure and arrival was on time with little to no issues in between but the IFE really needs way more options as I got bored easily.

### "a great service"
Sydney To Auckland. My first international trip with Virgin Australia and I must say that they offer a great service when compared with the other 5 airlines flying between the Tasman. Check-In was quick but not having efficient access for Passport Control and Security was frustrating, especially when you have paid for Premium service. After the quintessential Lounge visit, it was time for Boarding. Bus Gates are always inefficient and chaotic no matter how organise it is. Basically, priority Boarding goes out the window. The cabin crew were very pleasant once onboard, incredibly welcoming during pre take off with drinks and snacks. There was a slight delay due to congestion at Sydney airport with minimal communication but we landed only 15 mins late. Catering was good at best, only 2 options and were almost the same thing in my opinion plus a menu would have been a nice touch. IFE was decent, just not enough options in terms of movies and tv shows. Overall, I would definitely fly Virgin again overseas.

### "never been treated so poorly"
Sydney to Melbourne. I’m currently at the Virgin Australia terminal 32 -34 Sydney domestic airport and have never been treated so poorly by staff. Flights have been cancelled and when I went up to one of the members to ask what was happening, they shut me off and said “I can’t talk to you!”. Another lady looked at me and “there’s a good chance you won’t fly” in again a rude manner. I was quite upset and a staff member from Tiger noticed I was crying, so she came up to me and tried to help. I am beyond shocked at how rude the staff members are at Virgin. I fly frequently for work and usually with Jetstar, but I completely livid at how they treat their customers at Virgin. I will never choose this airline ever again.

### "Had my flight cancelled"
Not Verified |  Had my flight cancelled on a Friday night and their replacement flight was the next day in the afternoon but had to fly from Sydney to Adelaide and then to Melbourne? As annoying as that is because I was leaving on Sunday to head back the flight they booked to Adelaide from Sydney to Adelaide is delayed so I have to worry about catching the connecting flight to Melbourne? Horrible service.

### "It got 2 hours delay"
Adelaide to Sydney. It got 2 hours delay and they said lie to us. And then when the plane arrive to Sydney airport, it got another 15 mins delay on the ground. Totally unacceptable. They had 2 flights around an hour period within same weather situation. They said that delay happened for the reason of Sydney weather condition. So why the first Virgin Sydney flight just flew but our one got 2 hours delay.

### "Why did the captain cancel the flight"
Melbourne to Christchurch. Our flight was cancelled due to fog in Christchurch after we checked in and our bags had cleared customs. Travellers should be aware that Virgin does not pay for a hotel or book you on to another airline when cancellation is due to weather, unlike some of the better airlines. We became suspicious about the true reason for the cancellation after we noticed that Qantas, Jetstar and AirNZ flights that were leaving Australia around the same time proceeded to Christchurch as usual, and landed on time that night. Virgin told us that we were re-booked on to the same flight the following night i.e. a 24-hour delay. We asked how they could fit all of the passengers from the first night's flight on to the second night's flight and they said that not many people were booked on either the cancelled flight, or the following night's flight. Our concern is that Virgin had a big incentive to cancel the first flight and consolidate their passengers on to a single flight, so as to avoid a loss-making flight. The Australian civil aviation authority should monitor airline flight cancellations "due to weather" in comparison to other airlines. Why did the Virgin captain decide to cancel the flight when the other airlines didn't?

### "cramped and uncomfortable"
Not Verified |  Hong Kong to Sydney. Cannot believe that Virgin would find it acceptable to provide both the seating and food quality they do. The seats are no bigger than those on domestic flights lasting an hour or so. They are cramped and uncomfortable. The standard of food was also poor. I am a frequent traveller and also a velocity member and up until now have been thoroughly satisfied with the airline. My advice is to only fly internationally with Virgin Australia if you are utterly desperate.

### "Virgin Australia you suck"
I am bitterly disappointed with the flight I am on right now. Flying business class is supposed to be a pleasurable experience, you pay (a lot!) of extra money to enjoy a bit of luxury. Instead the chairs barely move back! Why have I paid all this extra money to not even recline?! It’s an absolute joke. I know there are much bigger problems in the world than my seat not reclining but I am tired and so desperately was looking forward to a sleep. Now not only will I not sleep but have that but I’ll have paid an arm and a leg just to sit in a pretty much normal seat. Virgin Australia you suck.

### "the flight is delayed"
Not Verified |  I paid 1140 AUD (400extra than the flight on following day) for a 2 hour flight from Broome to Perth just to be on time for my nephew birthday, booked Uber (70$ which burned as well) just to find out that the flight is delayed. When I spoke with the supervisor at Broome Terminal he said it's not our fault thinks like this happened.

### "most terrible experience"
Had the most terrible experience traveling from Sydney to Brisbane (VA 917) on 5th July. Firstly flight gets delayed by over half an hour. Finally when we get to Brisbane to get in to the connecting flight to LA ( VA7) we are told that boarding has closed and we cannot board the flight. There were 8 of us who ended up missing our flight. We a family of 4 and 4 other people had to put up with all the many excuses that were given to us some of which just contradictory and did not fit into the puzzle together. Then to add it to all the AFP were called because it seemed that we were intimidating the staff member  who was the one who told us that we could not board the airline. As well when the plane was ready for landing in Brisbane, the 8 of us traveling to LA were asked to make our way first to the exit as were to get to the connecting flight. But all we get to is being told that we cannot board the flight. How do airlines work if they do not seem to work together and there is no communication. My husband was then then questioned by the police on what was happening when it was no fault of ours. All we needed was an explanation. For my boys to see the police talk to their dad was something never expected as we are a values based family. We felt embarrassed and intimidated ourselves. All we get back is a stay in Brisbane at The Rydges with a $ 50 voucher. Nothing was done to even try and accommodate us on another flight. To add to it we were also given in writing that a Limo would transfer us from the Rydges ( Fortitude Valley) at 8:00 am to the airport. But guess what there was nothing there to pick us up. Well we made our way to Brisbane International Airport on our own. Monica at Brisbane International (Virgin Australia) was very accommodating. She empathasised with us and totally understood our anguish as well gave all the 8 of us the same message. Hopefully things change and no one else has to go through what we went through. All the 8 of us had things organized that had to be canceled. Just hoping that the next connecting flight is on time and there are no more issues. Hopefully this is an eye opener to the airline.

### "Very poor flight"
Melbourne to Perth. Very poor flight. Aircraft should be decommissioned! Late departure (30 minutes) with no communication. No inflight entertainment. Took ages to board and disembark. Meal not served until 2 hours into 4.5 hour flight. No water or refreshments until then. Two toilets for entire cabin which were dirty and smelly. Would not recommend Virgin for this leg ever. Staff were unfriendly and unhelpful and meals were barely fit for human consumption. Only positive was that the beer was cold.

### "A decent offering from Virgin"
Brisbane To Sydney. Everything was smooth from check in and security until it hit boarding time. There was absolutely no announcement as to why it was delayed and by the time we were ready to taxi, there was another delay due to weather conditions in Sydney. Cabin Crew were attentive, a great aspect of flying Business when an airline prides itself of great Customer Experience. Seeing as this was a 6am flight I didn't eat nor use the IFE, sleeping was mainly on my schedule. The delay was approximately 30 minutes, luckily I had enough time to head to another terminal for my next flight to Melbourne. A decent offering from Virgin, a higher level of service from my recent experiences compared to their main competitor.

### "nothing with this trip was good"
Los Angeles to Cairns via Brisbane. This was the first and only trip with Virgin Australia, I have been flying from overseas, either Europe or USA, the past 10 years at least 3 times a year. This trip stated in Winnipeg, first issue you can’t book from Winnipeg to Cairns on their homepage even that Their partner airlines, Delta is flying from there. Second issue the Cancel my flight and I got a hotel room, all good. I got on my plane is slightly delayed both in departures and arrival. After my arrival my biggest issue start, my one big suitcase is missing, apparently a lot of people missing the stuff from LA and since I have a connecting flight they is sending me to the finally destination and do the claim for my suitcase but no one is at the counter. So after 30 min someone is showing up. Now I have a lost baggage and a damaged suitcase, but they are not sure the cover my damage suitcase, but the other one was not home with my before 5 days after I left us, and it’s damage to. This is the first time ever that nothing with this trip was good.

### "your privacy is at risk"
As a platinum member of this Airline, I do not appreciate my personal details given out to people over the phone then emailed to other email adresses not on my file. This is a major breach. I am sharing this so you are aware that your privacy is at risk with this airline and good luck getting any reason, its been a month and all I get told is that they are looking into it but wont give me a name of someone I could follow up with. After 8 phone calls different departments, 5 emails and even posting on FB still they all say we are looking into it. Which I doubt they are. Deal with them at your own risk.

### "brilliant business class product"
Brisbane to Los Angeles. Up there with the best business class I've flown. Seat very comfortable and spacious. Food excellent. Wine very good but it would be nice to see some non-Australian wines for interest. IFE screen fantastic. I got a solid chunk of sleep. The best part of the flight was the staff - super hospitable and efficient. Only minor criticism was that my wine glass was whipped away rather than being offered a top up. The internet was also offline, but that doesn't bother me at all. Otherwise, a brilliant business class product that's difficult to fault. Look forward to seeing the new Brisbane International Lounge when it opens.

### "customers lost connections"
Not Verified |  It was supposed to depart Sydney at 9:30am and arrive in LA at 6:00am. It ended up leaving at 11:30am and as a result dozens of customers lost connections. No apology was issued and passengers were left scrambling to find other means to get to our final destination. Please don’t buy the ticket if you have connection in LAX of less than 2 hours. Customs is the worst, and the airport itself is super unfriendly. It is a shame that the so called international airport can only be compared to a third world airport.

### "absolutely dissatisfying"
Perth to Sydney. My experience with Virgin Australia was absolutely dissatisfying. That was for sure the last time i traveled with this airline. Fflight got cancelled and no one informed me. The journey took almost 5h longer than the one I purchased before and I arrived 8h later in the morning on the next day. The airplanes were old without entertaining system but WiFi which was not working.Absolutely unfriendly stewardess at some point even rude. It was so cold there I had difficulties to sleep and they didn’t have a blanket. I recommend to take a different airline.

### "Not recommended"
Perth to Melbourne. The only up side of the flight was on time departure and arrival. The aircraft was a bit old an seats and tables were dirty. The food was disgraceful with no condiments. Limited drink options were included and you had buy other drinks. No device for IFE was provided and you had to use your own device but there were no charging ports available! crew were OK but not outstanding. Virgin Australia seemed to be a budget airline which sells bundle tickets rather than a full fare airline which it claims to be! Saying that I have flown budget airlines with better quality than VA. I could have bought a better flight with the money paid for this one. Not recommended at all.

### "very professional and caring"
Cannot thank Virgin domestic staff for their help yesterday 21/5/19 when the travel agent failed to give us vital information about a visa they helped out tremendously so I didn't miss my flight and they ensured they didn't break any rules. It could of been disastrous and very costly. Being not an experienced traveler and not having the correct information by the travel agent, I found Virgin very professional and caring.

### "a 13 and a 5 hour layover"
I booked my flights with minimal layover time, 1.5 hours going there and 2 hours heading back. By the time of my vacation three of my flights had been changed leaving me with a 13 and a 5 hour layover. When I contacted the travel agent they told me they couldn't do anything. When I contacted Virgin Australia I was told I'd have to contact Delta since they were the ones actually doing the flights. When I tried to contact Delta they never responded. Since you all decided to pass the blame around with no one taking responsibility for stealing my time when I paid for certain accommodations and no one wanted to take responsibility you all deserve bad reviews. I will say this about Delta that I can't say about Virgin Australia, since I didn't deal with Virgin Australia other than over the phone, their grounds crew and plane crews were friendly. Then less than a month before my flight, when I was trying to find out what was going on, since no one had gotten back to me, I was told that she never had submitted it and that she in fact couldn't submit it.

### "No information, communication"
Not Verified | Los Angeles to Melbourne. Zero stars for Virgin Australia. My husband and I have been flying for 35 years and this was the worst experience we’ve ever encountered. Paid for business class tix and both outbound and return flights were cancelled, without explanation. No information, communication, customer service. VA didn’t notify us but rerouted is for a 30-hour 3-leg journey, instead of our direct flight, that would have us miss three vacation days. After hours of trying to get through to a representative, we salvaged some of our trip and only missed a day and a half but had to fly economy. Similar experience return trip. Flight cancelled hours before take off, with another 24+ hour delay. Had to buy our own tix to return on Qantas since we could not afford to lose more time. We returned over one month ago and are still trying to get VA to refund us. A nightmare.

### "Premium experience? No"
Brisbane to Melbourne with Virgin Australia. After checking in by machine we went to bag drop. First time ever in business was I asked for my carry on to be weighed. I was 500g over, so I took out my jacket and wore it, Premium experience. No. Next was the lounge, it was huge and jam packed with very few seats available. Too busy for staff to keep up with cleaning so we sat at a grubby table. Checking out the offerings, just a few salad items and bread you can toast. Premium experience? No. Next was boarding. Despite only 8 seats in business, the premium line had at least 30 in line. Again premium experience? No. The seat was okay but those in front of us reclined the moment we took off reducing our leg room to economy standard. Premium experience? No. No papers or magazines offered. The meal was the same as what we received on the one a few days previously but not as nice. We were not offered any device, had to use our own. To pay this much over economy you expect and should receive better than what Virgin offers, I would only ever go economy in future wth Virgin and take my own sandwich on board, saving many hundreds. Quite disappointing overall.

### "staff were okay but not attentive at all"
Melbourne to Brisbane with Virgin Australia. Check in at the airport was by machine, the Virgin staff directed us to economy line until I pointed out we were travelling business. Bit disappointing. The lounge was very busy with hardly any food options, never been in one that was so poor in its offering. Onto boarding. Although there are only 8 seats in business, obviously many qualified for boarding at the same time so the line up was of about 30 people. The seat was comfortable but no foot rest and no screen, only if you download their app on your own device. Juice or water was offered pre flight. The flight was not long enough for a movie however there were a number of series to watch. We were at least half an hour waiting on the plane before take off. The 8 business seats were all occupied. We had an Aussie celebrity in business who was given exclusive attention. The meal (lunch) was okay. The gnocchi was nice but Luke Mangan cookies were terrible, dry and tasteless. The staff were okay but not attentive at all. Didn’t matter too much for a two hour flight. Landing was smooth and luggage was one of the first off the belt. All in all not quite the premium experience I hoped for but it was good to have more space than in economy.

### "staff never smiled"
Proserpine to Brisbane. Not a great experience at all! I'll start with the rude, abrupt and ignorant staff who checked us in at Proserpine. Tried telling us we were over weight and needed to pay extra, however upon her looking after I told her we both had 30kg allowance she realised I was correct. No apology. My partner's case had been damaged on our travels which we told her about. She  threw a pen and paper for him to declare this then snatched it back off him! Totally rude with zero custom service and facial expressions show signs that she hates her job! Clearly not the job for her being in a customer service role. To note I wasn't the only person who I heard complain about her neither. When we got on the plane, staff never smiled. They are meant to make going on holiday a nice experience which wasn't my experience with . I have coeliac disease so asked for a GF alternative to the snack given. I was told by staff they would check but I'm still waiting now! I had to ask again if I could purchase crisps but they had practically ran out of all stock. Wont look to travel with Virgin Australia again or recommend  to anyone.

### "a reasonably good flight"
The flight was slightly delayed. Service was quite friendly and efficient. I appreciated that during the "happy hour" , they provided free beer or wine. The meal was very limited for what is supposed to be a full service airline. Just a small packet of crackers. QANTAS is far better. When I wanted to purchase something extra I was told to wait. The request was never followed up . Overall, though a reasonably good flight.

### "f"light was delayed 3hrs
On my travel to New Zealand I had chose Virgin Australia. While traveling from Sydney to Auckland was delayed 1.5 hours and from Queenstown to Sydney back the flight was delayed 3hrs - horrible and they never bothered to inform the passengers if it's was delayed by message or mail. We had to wait in airport

### "acceptable travel experience"
Townsville to Brisbane. Considering the cost, Qantas is still a more 'complete' product. But in saying that, Virgin still offers an acceptable travel experience. The service was on time and cabin crew were friendly, but maybe a tad scripted. The meal offering was fairly average, with only a gluten free bar served. Entertainment was offered, but was just a mobile website rather than a proper application. The cabin was relatively spacious for an economy product, but the seats were quite hard. Overall, a decent flying experience, which easily places Virgin (2nd) between Jetstar (3rd) and Qantas (1st).

### "the worst seats ever"
Not Verified |  First time I have flown Virgin Australia. I was happy with the service on my Darwin to Melbourne flight, staff were courteous and efficient, my snack was very edible. My major gripe would be the seats which are like sitting on a concrete bench. Halfway through my 4 hour flight I had to get up and stand down the back near the toilets just to relieve my discomfort. Seriously Virgin Australia you have to do something about those seats on a long domestic flight, they are truly up there with the worst seats ever.

### "excellent service"
Perth to Melbourne. I selected a “The Business” flight to maximise my enjoyment of this four hour flight, with private flat bed seats and excellent service. A pre-take off drink was provided, and the seat operation was explained to me. The flat bed seat, pillows and quilt were extremely comfortable. Food and service and IFE was excellent, and the amenities pack was decent too. My only regret was napping on this overnight flight.

### "cabin crew pleasant"
Not Verified |  A return journey to Sydney from Adelaide was uneventful. Boarding was orderly and completed by departure time of 1825. A repetitive problem is gate crew speaking so fast as to be unintelligible. This is common to most airlines and an issue management should address. Flight departed at 1840 and it was smooth flying. The cabin and toilets were clean and cabin crew pleasant. It was a full flight and I saw no vacant seats. One problem was my seat 23D which creaked loudly whenever I moved against the backrest. Arrival in Sydney was on schedule at 2045.

### "aircraft cabin was quite cool"
Not Verified |  Sydney to Adelaide. I arrived at the crowded Virgin departure terminal in SYD and tried to check-in at the self-use kiosk. My home-printed boarding pass would not scan, despite my best efforts. No signage on the machine instructed how to scan. Finally I asked a Virgin attendant who lowered the boarding pass about 15 centimetres below the scan port and bingo. Baggage tag was easy but peeling the backing sheet wasn’t. After that, I got on the end of a line of about 70 passengers waiting for the 3 bag drop kiosks operators. The whole process took about 34 minutes- the old-style check-in would have been just as slow. Come on Virgin you can do better, surely. The flight was late boarding and we finally pushed back almost 10 minutes late. The cabin was very clean . As we taxied to the runway the aircraft cabin was quite cool. After take-off the seat belt sign stayed on for a long time and the cabin got colder. I would guess the temperature was about 12-14 degrees. When the seat belt sign went off there was a rush of passengers getting sweaters or jackets from their carry-ons. I complained about the cold to a cabin attendant who replied they would increase the temperature. Nothing happened, I complained to a different attendant who agreed it as cold and promised to take action. After about 40 minutes there was a noticeable warming of the air. On the descent into Adelaide the air got cold again. Next time you fly Virgin, make sure you take a jacket on board. The flight schedule had us arriving at 1750 but we pulled up at the gate at 1806.

### "enjoyable return trip"
I had a very enjoyable return trip from Melbourne to Sydney. The crew were attentive and never hesitated to refresh my beverage or offer snacks. I appreciated the option for a welcome drink, i.e. water or orange juice. In-flight entertainment via the mobile app was also really good because there was a wide range of tv shows and movies to choose from. Highly recommend.

### "no entertainment offered"
Paid $1500 for three people to fly return Melbourne to Perth. For that price you have to self check in your bags, never do the machines work, there are very few staff available and those that are are arrogant and rude. Onboard the flight there is no entertainment offered unless you want to pay over $11.00 per hour for internet. Never ever again would I fly with virgin. I will take the cheaper flight with Tigerair and just pay for my extras.

### "never take Virgin again"
We were supposed to take Virgin Australia for our family holiday from Melbourne to Hong Kong on 11 April 2019. When we arrived airport, they told us our Surname has been entered as first name, need to correct. But they unwilling to do for us because we were mot booked tickets directly from them. Staffs told us that if the tickets were booked from Virgin, they can fix it within a minute and will let us go to the flight. Unfortunately we were booked from agent, so they told us contact agent and ask agent to call Virgin and the issue will be fix. Even our agent contact Virgin and Virgin said NO. Virgin Australia said they won't do the name correction and won't re-book for us. I really don't understand, the issue, it should be easy to fix, but they refuse to help, also different staff tell different things. If tickets buy from them, they will help, if not they won't. Terrible, never take Virgin again and will let all friends know.

### "An excellent experience"
Rarotonga to Auckland. An excellent experience mainly due to the new aircraft and attendants that were both friendly with a touch of a very personal service. Seats were very comfortable with pillows and blankets available, good iPad entertainment system and a nice cabin decoration with tasteful colours, materials and lights. The choice of food was Ok with a lot of beverages offered. Actually I was very positively surprised by the quality of the service provided.

### "good efficient service"
Not Verified | Melbourne to Sydney. I wish to compliment the whole service of Virgin Australia. Helpful check in staff Very friendly smiling cabin attendants. Excellent coffee, the best I have had on an aircraft. Excellent pilot, smooth safely landed flight Efficient exiting into Sydney airport. Reflecting back on the trip I realised just how much we take good efficient service for granted when flying. Thank you Virgin I’m flying with you by choice, again! Susan

### "in life we get what we pay for"
Auckland to Hong Kong via Sydney. Took the flight with one piece of checked in luggage which didn’t make it to Hong Kong. After it was established that it would not be, the company hired by VA at Hong Kong airport to handle luggage issues contacted the company (VA) who came back with the notice that the bag would arrive on the same flight the next day. I was unpleasantly surprised double fold: first it is customary that in view of such an occurrence the company will try their best to find the next flight to intended destination so that the inconvenience is as small as possible, second nobody advanced not even a toiletry purse. I had three nights in Hong Kong and two full days, one of which was spent with the clothing worn on a long day of travel and without any support except the dry commitment of having the bag delivered on the same flight next day, which it was. The old adage that claims that in life we get what we pay for is entirely proven right in the case.

### "Keep up the good work"
My husband and myself flew Denpasar to Brisbane on flight VA 44 the flight was delayed but we were kept informed. We paid extra to sit in economy x seats emergency row. There was an unpleasant incident caused by 2 rude arrogant young passengers directed at myself. The hostesses quickly sorted things out and looked after me very well even getting security to escort us through immigration , baggage and to our driver just in case we were harassed by these people. Thank you for your kindness. We have had 4 overseas flights in the last 5 months using economy x seats and have been very happy with let room. Definitely worth the extra cost. Food and drink on these flights was good, plane was very clean. Keep up the good work Virgin.

### "practice of overselling flights"
I had booked - reserved and fully paid- a flight from Sydney to Canberra with Virgin Australia this morning. I arrived on time but I couldn't check in. I was informed that the flight was oversold and therefore I wasn't allowed to check in or board. My alternatives were getting a refund from VA, which didn't worked as I was then left with the problem of trying to book an expensive last min ticket. Or getting on the next flight in the afternoon. I had an itinerary of meetings planned according to the flight I booked. I had to cancel half of my customer meetings because of VA not honouring my booking. I was further informed that VA has a practice of overselling flights betting on some customers not showing up. But in cases like mine today, where most of the booked customers do show up and VA is beyond its plane's capacity (because VA oversold the flight in the first place), VA simply dismisses an "unfortunate" customer. That dismissed unfortunate customer was me today. I will do my best, and advice anyone, not fly VA to not be that "unfortunate" customer again. VA today unfortunately wasted my time, inconvenienced me through a long and stressful check in process, and disrupted my meetings with customers. But more importantly, VA has no credibility if it can't honour its bookings. The one star in my rating goes to the check in assistant who genuinely apologised throughout this situation, her customer care was clearly at odds with VA's practice of overselling flights.

### "worst airline I have ever flown"
Not Verified |  Bali to Christchurch via Sydney. Virgin Australia is the worst airline I have ever flown with and will never fly with again. The flight to Sydney from Bali had no screens, and it was for 6 to 7 hours. I also had a screaming child sitting behind me and the parent was letting it pull my hair, kick non-stop at the back of my seat as we were waiting for people to finish boarding the plane. When they asked if people felt unwell and if anyone needed sick bags, I also put up my hand as I had been sick during my trip and I wanted to move seats as I was getting a headache already from the baby behind me and the inconsiderate parents. The flight attendants did not care or want to help out on the matter of feeling unwell and instead wanted to kick me off the aircraft as they said they don't want sick people on the flight. I was not sick, I had been ill 2 days ago and feel as though the air hostesses were instead setting people up to ruin their holiday even further by stranding them when I just wanted to get the hell home. After arguing with the unsympathetic air hostesses and giving them back my sick bag they finally let me remain on the flight despite kicking 2 other poor people off, and they did nothing but make me feel uncomfortable or like a nuisance for trying to ask for a more comfortable flight. The baby kicked and screamed the whole flight and I just about fainted when I got off the plane in Sydney. Get better air hostesses who seem to want to bring people down and wreck their holidays rather than help make the flight better! So don't ever put your hand up if they go around asking if you're feeling unwell - they will just kick you off the flight rather than try to help you! Also the food was terrible, so cheap and tacky it was worse than hospital food and you only had 2 options - meat eaters could opt for the vegetarian food meaning that some vegetarians had no food when their options ran out at the end of the plane.

### "Quick, efficient flight"
Melbourne to Hobart. Quick, efficient flight, good drinks service from the cheerful crew and we soon landed at Hobart. Good value at £60 for a single ticket. The baggage collection at Hobart was chaotic, but I think that was not Virgin Australia's fault, and the airport needs to look at how it handles multiple landings in a short space of time.

### "flying with Virgin more often"
Brisbane to Sydney. I tend to with Qantas quite a lot and in my opinion there is a difference in service. The Boarding process started on time, with priority given to Business Class and High tiered Frequent Flyers. The Team welcoming passengers onboard were fantastic. The Customer Service Manager was leading a very well trained team. The meal served was delicious, with desserts to compliment. Seating was comfortable, but not for more then 3 hours. IFE content was very adequate, plenty of entertainment to keep you occupied. I definitely will be flying with Virgin more often.

### " cabin was quite empty"
Sydney to Brisbane. Haven't flown Virgin Australia since August 2017 but thought I give them another chance as they had Double Status Credit Promotions. Check In and Security were very fast and efficient. The Boarding process was on time and It's great to see priority passengers given way first then general boarding began. The flight was less than half full, a strange sight to see. The cabin crew were professional, even offering other seats for extra comfort as the cabin was quite empty. Great to see an update to the IFE with plenty of new content. The arrival was 20 minutes early, that's also another first for me. Overall, I can see a huge improvement to the quality of service and it's given a reason to start flying with Virgin more.

### "professional and seamless service"
Sydney to Darwin. Virgin Australia provided a professional and seamless service both on the ground as well as inflight. It was a 4 and a half hour flight and we were given refreshments and healthy food, hot and cold, twice. The staff interacted positively with their peers and customers. Will definitely be seeking out Virgin flights for self and family in the future.

### "the experience was unpleasant"
Queenstown to Sydney with. Just such a poor service provider. From start to finish the experience was unpleasant. When we lined up to check in with 3 desks open we were 8 people from the front. It took 35 minutes to get to the point where we stepped up to check in. Was crazy how slow they were so I started timing. Over 7 minutes per check in. Then the flight was over an hour late to board. No updates, no communication, absolutely nothing. Only silver lining is that this was a business paid trip. I won’t be using the Virgin airline providers again.

### "wouldn’t allow me carry it on board"
Rockhampton to Brisbane. Upon arriving at checkin I was apparently 3 mins past checkin closing time, the checkin assistant rudely reprimanded me telling me that I have missed the flight because I arrived 3 minutes late and behaved as though I was late because I was flegmatic. She advised she would need to as her manager if she could check me in, who sat in the second seat next to her. The manager “approved” based off the fact the plane was running late. She then insisted to weigh my carryon and because it was over 7 kgs did nothing other than tell me that I cannot take it onboard with me. Of course I couldn’t move items into checked in luggage which was a small bag and packed to the brim. I had to request that I pay extra to carry it on with me for additional weight and advised I had done this before. She charged me extra but wouldn’t allow me carry it on board. She unnecessarily rushed me through the process and didn’t ask me if I had fragile items in the bag. I certainly was not satisfied with this kind of treatment or assistance in finding an appropriate solution. The flight attendant did not smile once even when being shown courtesy and smile to her, and when asking what I would like she would raise her eyebrows each time. Good service including helpfulness and friendliness is a weakness with all staff across the board. Just terrible.

### "an hour of free wifi service"
Melbourne to Sydney. I bought my tickets separately, but it seems to me the flight attendant was making sure I had my return ticket out of Australia. I assumed that many people go to Australia and not leave. In the airplane, I just had to use the bathroom really quick, but the attendant made a big deal to make sure everyone stay seated when the seatbelt sign was on. So, since they made quite a scene about it, I just went along with them. The good thing is that the flight had an hour of free wifi service.

### "Late again and again"
Adelaide to Perth. Late again and again, I don't know why my company insists to book with Virgin Australia. Definitely I am not going to use virgin for my personal trips.

### "no hello” or a smile"
Took an early morning international flight from Sydney to Nadi. Check in counter opened 30 minutes late. Once the crew had indicated that the checkin counter was open, they had all gathered in the business class check service desk and left passengers waiting to be served at economy desk. I found it particularly disturbing that there was no pleasant acknowledgement “hello” or a smile while assisting and the same was on board the flight. The tight lipped airhostess seemed like to be supervising an exam, again no smile or acknowledgement even when being directly served. I choose to fly with virgin Australia simply because it’s an Australian airline but I just want to highlight that the little things matter and no matter what the added logistics are, delayed flight, late checkin etc, pleasant crew members always help. Let’s not forget the fellow passengers who arrive 3 hours before for international flight.

### "meal could have been better"
Melbourne to Sydney. Unfortunately, after checking in online for my 6:15 flight I found out that it was cancelled and I had to wait till 8:00 pm. The service was efficient and friendly. The meal could have been better. They should be serving a full meal on business class for a 8.00 pm flight, not a snack. The wine served was excellent. They offered a tablet, which was a bit cumbersome and had limited offering .

### "do not refund the ticket"
Hong Kong to Melbourne via Sydney. Be careful buying a ticket from Virgin Australia - if you want to cancel within 24 hours they do not refund the ticket as promised I cancelled my ticket within 24 hours after booking 5 December 2018 but have not yet received the refund of AUD 1.100. Two months have passed but still no sign of the money. The only thing you get is a customer service reply that they are looking into the matter.

### "I am extremely disappointed"
Brisbane to Sydney. I was coming with my boss who booked in business class and was waiting in a queue to board the flight a few mins ago. I am very disappointed and upset with the way that I have been treated when we tried to scan in and board on the flight, I realise I was only in economy but when I tried to scan and get in, the lady who was working in the front told me that it's only business class and gold class customers allowed to get in at the time and I was supposed to go all the way back and have a seat until economy is called out. It didn't make much of a difference to just let me in instead of embarassing me in front of everyone and asking me to leave. I have previously travelled with Virgin and have never experienced this sort of behaviour but I am extremely disappointed and upset of being treated this way today.

### "a very good domestic flight"
Brisbane to Sydney. This was my first flight with Virgin Australia as I normally fly with Qantas for most the time. Virgin Australia surprised me by how well they do their priority boarding although I was flying in economy. They enforce it strictly and fully exhibit what priority boarding should look like as opposed to its counterpart. Seats were comfortable and legroom was reasonable for me (a thin guy with a height of 177cm). As the flight wasn’t full, there was an empty seat between my and my neighbour (3-3 config). It was an early evening flight (5pm) so I light snack was provided. All economy guests were provided with cheese and crackers alongside with some apricots and a choice of drink. There’s also an inflight menu just in case you need something more. Food was satisfactory for this short flight and I was rather surprised that they serve cheese! Staff were also friendly and attentive. It was overall a very good domestic flight.

### "flight was very good"
Canberra to Brisbane. My review is more about the service personal at the Canberra check-in counter. I travelled from Canberra to Brisbane on the 4th Feb 2019 (business class). I arrived around 10:00am at the counter and there were very few (max around 3) passengers for luggage drop-off/check-in. There were about 3-4 personal including (I assume) a trainee at the check-in counter. They were doing the job but friendly customer service was not included during the execution of their tasks. Otherwise the service at the lounge and during the flight was very good.

### "Poor beverage service"
Sydney to Brisbane. Second time flying Virgin Australia. Like this airline, it's cheaper than QANTAS. Poor beverage service. I've gotten crackers and cheese. Very appreciative of the WiFi. The only bad thing was broken checked bag. Since I was staying in Brisbane for short amount of time, repair wasn't available.

### "pleased with their offering"
Melbourne to Los Angeles. I'm a regular flyer to the USA and have tried all the major carriers on the route. More recently I've been using Virgin Australia and have been overall very pleased with their offering. I am now Platinum status but this doesn't really seem to make much difference internationally, whereas at home it ensures priority. On my most recent flight I was particularly impressed with the crew who were very attentive and I can confirm that 'The Business' is one of the best J class offerings. The menu is very good, although the servings are modest. Improvements could be made in boarding in LA where they ask you to be at the gate one hour prior to departure only to wait half an hour to board with little or no priority. All flights were full and the crews did pretty well. VA has a good product, but is still limited internationally because of lack of metal. Let's hope this improves as they are definitely worth a try.

### "Absolutely great service"
Not Verified |  Brisbane to Sydney. People usually only leave a review if they had a bad experience. Its uncommon to hear of the positive experiences such as the one I had. The biggest compliment I can give is to the staff working for Virgin. They were incredibly helpful, polite and professional . Absolutely great service and will continue to fly with Virgin.

### "Worst service ever received"
Melbourne to Hobart. We arrive at airport as requested (1 hr prior to flight) due to maintenance at Virgin checkin. We wait for flight, time passes and then announcement after dep time that flight is delayed. Another 30 min passes then informed flight will board at 4:30 to depart at 4:50. This passes, then another announcement saying flight cancelled - no other information given!! 15 mins later people still waiting and now lining up to find out what is going on. No announcement. After 30 min I line up in long queue (no communication at all from ground staff - extremely poor customer service) I ask flight desk attendant what is happening and she was very RUDE not only to me but to previous customer. Told we would NOT get a refund or any compensation it is not the airlines fault. No info about what will happen to customers! I then get email saying I am booked on 9:40 flight, sitting away from my daughter. I had paid premium. I had to physically go into site and change seats ( enough available to sit together) We were not offered any vouchers for inconvenience. I went back 30 mins later and had to request a voucher which we received to value $32.... I’m told can use any where. Cafe said I had to use it in one go or I’d lose $ amount. We are here to 9:40 and have been here since 2:15! Absolutely ridiculous. I am a frequent flyer member, try to fly Virgin but will no longer! Worst service ever received and no I was not rude nor were any other customers in front of me.

### "seat didn’t recline"
Sydney to Broome via Perth. Airline staff are lovely. The flight from Perth to Sydney seat didn’t recline. Flight from cairns to Sydney, seat did not recline. Telephone customer service / velocity service is absolutely appalling. Dreadful. Just unbelievable.

### "Very unprofessional"
Not Verified |  Melbourne to Auckland. Had a morning flight at 9:30am. Airport wasn't busy and flights were taking off as planned. Well, our flight we didn't board until 9:50 and didn't take off until 10:15. I had a connection to get to my regional town at 5:00 so we were on a deadline. Virgin Australia had no explanation as to why the flight was suddenly delayed because our plane was sitting there for an hour, which in that hour we could've gone. Positive though is they made up time of 10 minutes but if i didnt have that 10 minutes i would've missed my other flight. Unreliable, already flew to Melbourne with them last month and another 1 and a half long delay lucky i had no connections. Very unprofessional. Only good if you don't have a deadline.

### "Every flight delayed"
Auckland to Adelaide via Melbourne. Previous (first) flight i had my bag left behind. Returned to me at a later date. Flight delays, missed flights, no information that flights were delayed, no apologies. Helpful man when needing to rebook missed connection. Every flight delayed. Not impressed. Will endeavour never to fly with them again. Not recommend. Some staff were lovely; most staff not apologetic or understanding. Definitely by far the worst service and organization I've experienced with any airline. It's worth it to pay more for another airline.

### "I need to shift airlines"
Los Angeles to Sydney. Now Virgin has no alliance partners, at LAX airport travelling back to Sydney only allowed 1 guest if you are gold status. Meant for my family I could either have my 8 year old daughter join me in the lounge or husband but not both. This is really bad customer service and poor by Virgin. If you cannot get better deals than this for FF flyers you should have stayed in an alliance. I need to shift airlines.

### "the flight was cancelled"
Brisbane to Melbourne. After waiting for 1 hour to check our luggage in we were informed the flight was cancelled, we had purchased our tickets through princess cruise ships , who at that time informed us they were guaranteed flights virgin had to re book us or find an alternate airline. Virgin just said sorry no can do we can get you there after your boat has left not sooner. Time line Brisbane airport we arrived at 430 am we needed to be in Melbourne by 5pm 12.5 hours later. We went to Qantas, same location, same weather, same destination, they could and did sell us tickets to arrive in time.

### "aircraft like cattle pens"
I booked a Virgin Atlantic flight from London to Melbourne and Hong Kong to Melbourne was with Virgin Australia. My only gripe with Virgin Australia is the seat pitch and it was dreadful. I am 6ft and knees wedged against seat in front all the whole journey and made worse on Return Leg when seat in front reclined as took out my drink. Asked on both legs to upgrade to Extra Legroom seats and told none available. I sat in Row 29 and Row 28 all seats with extra legroom on Outbound were empty!!! It was my birthday when I travelled so played this card to Cabin Crew once airborne and guess what,  still spent journey looking at empty/roomy seats in front of me. I will never travel Virgin Australia again and made a point of booking internal flights once in Australia with Jetstar where legroom was 2 inches more and cheaper. Well done Virgin Australia, lost another customer for making your aircraft like cattle pens in Economy.

### "the seat design is flawed"
This was the first time I had flown VA business since they had retro fitted new business seats. First up, the cabin service was excellent. The food was okay to good - the lunch service was okay (fish was overcooked and hard), the breakfast service was delicious. They have on board coffee machines that serve ground coffee. My seat, 5A, was in the main business class cabin. It was a full business class flight. Unfortunately, the seat design is flawed, especially for tall people (I am 192cm tall). Although the bed fully reclines, the fixed position of the tray table that cannot be stowed means you are in the equivalent of a sleeping straight jacket. You cannot turn over as your hips bang against the tray table. Also, it is annoying how the only way you can exit the pod is if the seat is in the upright position, and even then, the clearance to exit makes it awkward. If there is a plus to the set up, it is privacy. The configuration is certainly more private that the prior version, but it comes at the cost of space. Now you feel like you are in a pen like a cow. I'm a frequent business traveler, and in my opinion, what I pay for is space, convenience, and service. Unfortunately, although the service was high class, because of the flawed seat design I will not be rebooking my next flight across the Pacific using Virgin Australia. It's a conundrum, how do you rate the flight when the service was a 9 (lost a point of the lunch), but the seat was a 1? I guess you have to average it out. Hence a 5. I would not recommend this seat configuration for: a. Tall people, unless you can sleep and get comfortable on your back. b. Elderly or those with mobility issues. It is difficult to get in and out of the seat. c. Those that like to rest on their side. The position of the tray table will make that difficult. I would recommend it for: a. Those like value privacy b. Those that can get comfortable in any position, or those who don't want to sleep c. The quality of the service. Finally, Wi Fi was good. There was about 2 hours with no service, but otherwise browsing and downloading was fine. Uploading was patchy and not particularly good.

### "The worst airline ever"
Sydney to Denpasar. The worst airline ever! Check in facilities were a joke! I arrived at the airport at 0550 for a flight departing at 0805 to BNE & DPS. I waited in the queue to get inside the terminal for over 40 minutes. Once inside, the queue snaked along and the kiosks weren't able to cope and wouldn't print out passes or bag labels! I finally got to the 'urgent' counter (1 & 2) - for flights departing at 0730 and 0800 - at 0750 and  was told I was too late and not allowed to board my flight to BNE meaning I would also miss my connecting flight to Bali/DPS). Pathetic excuses for their delays "which are due to the large number of people wanting to go on holiday" and "an unexpected number of people from a cruise ship. Pathetic Service Counter: given their inability to cope with the surprising number of travellers, there was only 1 person on the counter! Another later arrived but all up I waited 1 1/2 hrs to get rebooked onto another flight. By the time I transferred to the international terminal I had to run to board the departing flight at 1120. I had been queuing for 5 1/2 hrs straight. The vegetarian curry was lukewarm with stodgy rice and the coffee tepid. In the past 4 yrs I have travelled the world and experienced better service at third world airports, and received better service and superior food on less 'branded' airlines.

### "the worst fight ever"
Gold Coast to Sydney. It’s the worst fight ever, delay 3 hours and no one from Virgin crew to give any explanation. Virgin stuff are rude and they have no manners with people The funny part is : on board they ask you to relax .

### "Lack of any assistance"
22nd December we were due to fly out of Hobart to Sydney for a connection flight to Gold Coast (home). Just after 6am I received an email advising our flight had been cancelled and we would be flying into Melbourne the next day with 3 hr stop over before a connection flight to Gold Coast. This did not work for us as we had pets that needed to be cared for and had no accommodation in Hobart. Tried to contact Virgin by phone to ask what options we had. Waited on the phone for well over 1 hour and gave up waiting to speak to someone and had to book (at our own expense and highly inflated prices) a direct flight from Hobart to Brisbane and had to find a way back to the Gold Coast airport. The staff at the checkin counter were not able to assist us at all. Then the new flight we had booked was delayed approximately 3 hours while waiting for crew to arrive. Lack of any assistance or staff leaves us with a extremely bad experience with this airline. We have been loyal customers to Virgin Australia for many trips but will be definitely looking at other airlines in the future.

### "seats were very comfortable"
Perth to Sydney with Virgin Australia. The flight couldn’t have gone better. The flight attendants were excellent, food was good, the flight departed and landed on time, boarding was quick. The seats were very comfortable.

### "queue for over an hour"
Not Verified | Canberra to Los Angeles via Melbourne. We stood in the queue for over an hour waiting to check in while there was one person on the desk. Terrible service we almost missed our flight because they can’t roster more people on to help worh check in. We were not the only people who this happened to either.

### "cancelled due to lack of staff"
Not Verified |  Perth to Sydney. Absolutely horrible customer service. I am never using this company ever again and strongly don’t recommend it to others. We had a 3.30 flight which then got delayed 9 hours. After waiting and boarding our flight got cancelled due to lack of staff. There was also no one to advise us on the whole area to advise us during our delayed time.

### "joke of an airline"
Not Verified |  Arrived for flight to Adelaide at 2pm. Flight arrived from Adelaide on time for us to board. Scanner broken as we were boarding no back up. Boarded eventually. As the last passenger boarded the captain announced we couldn’t make Adelaide curfew. Flight canceled. Waited for 2.5 hours in at the helpdesk to be put on two flights eventually making our way to Adelaide at mid day the following day. Fine. Boarded again but flight was cancelled due to lack of crew. Told now we can’t fly for 3 days. Total joke of an airline. Will never fly with them again.

### "Beyond disappointing"
Not Verified | Sydney to Fiji. Worst flight ever! Not only did my family and I have to wait 4 hours before departing but our luggage was removed from the plane, along with 112 other passengers to make room for “more fuel” as we were told that there would be horrible weather conditions in Fiji. Funnily enough, the weather was perfect when we arrived in Fiji. We now have to wait a whole day until we receive our luggage. Beyond disappointing.

### "the worst airline ever"
Sydney to Brisbane. Virgin Australia cancelled the flight without informing the customer earlier. They said the flight was delayed and cancelled the flight when we have arrived. The customer service was very poor and the attitude of them towards the customers was terrible. They just blame all the responsibility to the weather and they do not  understand the customer at all. This is the worst airline ever!

### "seat pitch was the worst"
Melbourne to Perth. The seat pitch was the worst I have experienced in a full service airline on a 3.8 hr flight to Perth for many years. I and the male passenger next to me are close to 185 cm high and had had our knees jammed hard against the seat in front. We both were very uncomfortable from the moment we sat down.The best point of the trip was when it ended and we could stand up. My canvas stlyle suitcase was the dirtiest I have experienced on any flight. To pay over $700 return for the most uncomfortable seats I`ve experienced for many years particularly on my 3 annual trips to Perth means I wont be flying Virgin for a while..

### "Thanks to the Melbourne team"
Melbourne to Adelaide. My partner and I were running late due to standard Melbourne roadworks and traffic, yet the Virgin Australia team were seamlessly able to get our bags checked in and get us through to our gate in time. This is the best experience I have had with an airline and am confident in choosing Virgin as my preferred airline in the future. Thanks to the Melbourne team for being awesome and we hope to fly with you again soon!

### "enjoyable and comfortable"
Auckland to Denpasar via Sydney. Although Virgin Australia is a budget carrier, my flight was c The seat was comfortable and the leg room was wide. The in-flight food was delicious. Their staffs were also very pleasant. Entertainment system was not available on board.

### "just appeared to not care"
Not Verified |  Adelaide to Canberra via Melbourne. Flight was delayed getting off the ground and then delayed getting into Melbourne by air traffic control. This is out of Virgin's control. I informed staff on the plane of this and they said 'you'll be right'. We were then told to see staff at the top of the airbridge when we landed. There were no staff! We get to the flight to Canberra and the flight is closed, we probably missed it by 5 minutes. This has totally stuffed up my efforts to look after my client. The flight times from Adelaide to Canberra are pretty difficult to achieve any sort of business timing that works. So to have a connecting flight without any care for those that are trying to transfer is pretty poor. All we got from the Virgin Staff in Melbourne was 'We calculated that you would not make it and then just put you on the next flight. If they could have held it for 5 minutes we would have made it. If we had some help from Virgin before landing we definitely would have! They just appeared to not care. My experience with Virgin is that they are nearly always late and they love to provide information that is not quite correct to keep you happy until the actual truth of when you are boarding, leaving, flying or landing is given. Very unhappy and will be avoiding them in future.

### "7 hours delayed"
Auckland to Brisbane. Got 7 hours delayed, which was understandable. However, the first thing that ground staffs need to do is to apologise. Virgin needs to work on that. I was given $24 voucher for my inconveniences. If ground staff can apologise and explain clearly what's going on, for me it is worth more than the food voucher.

### "lost a customer Virgin"
I used to love Virgin for domestic travel in Australia but my last few experiences have turned me off them unless I have no choice. Today’s trip was 1/2 hour late which meant we missed our connecting flight. Ok, fair enough these things happen. So we are bumped to a later flight which means we missed our dinner engagement. Ok, not a dealbreaker but what annoys us the most is that we paid extra for upfront seats and when we get re-allocated seats we get standard seats. They can see that we have already paid for better seats but they don’t automatically give you the rightful seats. It is up to us to ask for the correctly paid seats and only then do they give them to you. You have lost a customer Virgin as you obviously don’t care enough to look after your higher paying customers.

### "no communication"
Due to fly Virgin Australia from Mackay to Brisbane. Been sitting on plane for over an hour and a half in Mackay, no communication between front of plane to back. Waiting for an engineer to fix problem, just finished a shift in coal mines. Going to fly Qantas next time.

### "7 hours delay"
Sydney to Bali. 7 hours delay for aircraft maintenance without any official notification. No one at the counter to take care of situation. After looking for a staff all over the airport I got a $8 meal voucher.

### "Food was terrible"
Not Verified | Canberra to Perth. Delayed, asked staff why and they wouldn't give a reason other than it is. Food was terrible. Seat was wet. No flight entertainment unless you download the app previously, which I did but wifi was so nonexistent nothing loaded.

### "seats overall were comfortable"
Canberra to Perth. Virgin Australia has chartered flights throughout the year between the two cities and it only flies PER-CBR and CBR-PER direct during Parliament Sitting Weeks. I booked my flight through an agent but I was able to call Virgin Australia to upgrade my seat to Economy X for AUD59, which gives me extra leg room on a 4.5 hours flight. Check-in through the Virgin Australia app is quick and easy, The boarding experience at Canberra airport is slightly chaotic, as people were skipping queues instead of giving way to priority boarding passengers. The airport should have another ground staff to make the boarding faster and more efficient. The Boeing 738 was kept tidy, neat and clean. However, there were no USB ports nor built-in screen for inflight entertainment on these aircraft, which is disappointing especially the former. Passengers travelling on Economy X seat gets their own spot for hand carry luggage which makes the additional costs worthwhile, in addition to the leg room. The seats overall were comfortable with plenty of legroom to stretch. About 45 minutes after airborne, the cabin crew comes around with complimentary hot food for dinner. The dinner comes with a mini coconut bread as dessert, as well as complimentary drinks (both alcoholic and non-alcoholic options). The choice on the flight was Moroccan lamb with couscous or vegetarian tortellini. I chose the former, and there was generous portion of couscous, the lamb was well-flavoured and cooked to tender. However, I would appreciate more sauce with the meat, as well as some vegetables in it as well. Throughout the flights, the cabin crew went around for another round of beverages, and then another round of water to keep passengers hydrated. It was overall an uneventful flight, but I wish Virgin Australia will make this a regular flight rather than a seasonal flight to better connect the two Australian cities.

### "delayed for 2 hours"
Sydney to Gold Coast. Very bad service. Flight delayed for 2 hours and no update nothing. Need to learn time management. Won’t travel again in Virgin Australia. Won’t recommend to anyone.

### "Armrests are so short"
Sydney to Albury. Check in was good with the mobile phone app and plenty of available kiosks once at the airport but had to contact the service centre and go through drop outs and/or a wait at least 30 minutes to request a seat preference. Flight was delayed by 1.5 hours due to a last minute technical glitch forcing all to de-plane and a complete change of aircraft as well as a gate change to reboard. Sydney airport gate area could do with better seating around the phone charger zones. Albury to Sydney had no space no thanks to the awful passenger allocated next to me who incidentally was the last to de-plane. When the passenger used their seat belt the straps kept whipping against my leg and my arm. Both legs - Getting a hot and cold beverage choice plus a snack was a bonus. Inflight magazine was a good read, 2 choices of newspapers but had no footspace no thanks to the terribly designed foot planks of the seat in front. Armrests are so short I felt like I had ostrich wings as arms. Headroom is limited in the seating position. No wifi, no power socket. There was one nice cabin crew and one cranky cabin crew per flight. Windows had hair grease on it. Velocity points arent automatically posted upon arrival unlike other loyalty programmes

### "Absolutely horrible experience"
Melbourne to Gold Coast. Absolutely horrible experience. Not only was my flight changed to 9 hours back but I was only notified once I arrived at the airport! To further this, the location the flight was taking off was not clear and once everyone was ready to board no staff came to the desk for over an hour, leaving everyone on the flight wondering what the hell is going on. Shocking job Virgin.

### "staff were great"
Flew Melbourne to Sydney with Virgin Australia. The staff were great, really helpful and friendly. It’s made me decide to fly Virgin more often. I was running slightly late from the airport bus and they got me through and onto the plane.

### "not very happy at all"
Proserpine to Brisbane. Flight attendants were not very happy at all, looked like they didnt want to be there Thought the little health bar that was offered with tea or coffee was pathetic and tastless, come on Virgin you can do better than this, what about crackers and a bit of cheese at least.

### "so polite and helpful"
Auckland to Melbourne. The flight crew was so polite and helpful and to help me in a situation where my phone was about to die And one of them personally giving me one of theirs powerbank to charge my phone was very appreciated And this is the reason i love travelling with virgin australia.

### "felt marginally more comfortable"
Melbourne to Perth. Check-in easy via self serve kiosks. Warm welcome on boarding cabin crew were smiling and assisting passengers. A hot meal was served and this time exceeded expectations it was beef stroganoff which was hot and tasty. Complimentary beer, wine and soft drinks were offered twice during the flight. The flight felt marginally more comfortable with no obvious reason why that would be. A very acceptable long domestic flight.

### "All in all an ok flight"
Perth to Melbourne. Checkin was fast and easy using self serve kiosks. Boarding was orderly and fast. Greeted at the door by the cabin service manager and welcomed aboard. Cabin crew appeared aloof during boarding a lack of welcoming smiles. A hot meal was served which while not spectacular was adequate Complimentary beer, wine, soft drinks, water and juice were available throughout the flight. Call bells answered promptly. No announcement from the flight deck except to advise that due to congestion at Melbourne we needed to hold and land 30 minutes behind schedule. Seat comfort was ok, leg room ok (I am 6ft) All in all an ok flight nothing negative.

### "Very poor customer service"
Not Verified | Melbourne to Hamilton Island via Sydney. Very poor customer service, our 7.45am flight was delayed by half an hour so I went up to the counter the check what to do as we had a connecting flight with Virgin, staff at the counter was so rude when I asked her what to do, but she assured us that we would have plenty of time for our connecting flight (20 mins). A few minutes later they called us to the desk to let us know that we will indeed be missing our connecting flight and we would now have to wait 2.5 hours at the airport for a different flight. We received a $16 virgin voucher, what a joke.

### "flight has been delayed twice"
Sydney to Perth. I paid double the price of a TigerAir flight because I believed that I would get better service on Virgin. So far, the flight has been delayed twice. We were informed of the delay too late to be able to stay at work or home. I should have stuck with the cheaper airline! At least then I would have felt that the flight delay was to be expected!

### "no communication from staff"
Sydney to Queenstown. This is the first time I have flown Virgin and I will not be doing it again! For the amount I paid in tickets I should have at least been offered a meal for an international flight. After being delayed at the airport with absolutely no communication from staff, the passengers getting their information online from the airport itself, we couldn’t leave to get food or go to the toilet as the delay only jumped 20 mins at a time therefore missing the flight was too high a risk. Then to get on the plane and not be offered a sorry or anything but a plastic cup with water. Cheers for your terrible service.

### "like winning the lottery"
Brisbane to Perth. Fantastic ground service. Friendly, efficient with a smile. Getting on Virgin's Airbus for domestic flights is like winning the lottery. Seats are really comfortable and recline to a flat bed. Great in flight service, professional and with a smile. Even the words they use "your dinner menu if you wish to join us tonight". Very luxurious. Noise cancelling headsets. Touchscreen entertainment screens. Overnight pack. After a wonderful dinner, I fell asleep on the flatbed and the stewardess dimmed my lights for me. When VA flies the Airbus, the outstanding comfort and food is elevated by world class service.

### "Worst international flight"
Denpasar to Brisbane. Worst international flight I ever experienced. Firstly, Virgin advertised itself as a full service airline, while in fact it is a budget airline with basic services. The Boeing 737 is small and uncomfortable for international flight - Virgin tries to save cost by not using Aerobridge in Bali. It was hot and unpleasant experience - Extremely illogical baggage rule. No piece can exceed 23kg despite having combined luggage allowance between 4 of us of 92kg. As our 2 suitcases weigh 25kg each, we have to bring another suitcase to meet this requirement. I understand the usual airlines rule of baggage not exceeding 32kg for OH&S reason. But why 23kg? Pretty much BYO entertainment system. Meal and drinks included, but only 1 drink. So if you want another glass of coke, you need to pay. Despite accepting kids meal request, there are no kids meal on board. They dont even have blanket for an overnight flight. Seat paddings are very thin and uncomfortable for long flight For the icing on the cake, our 8am connecting flight from Brisbane to Sydney was cancelled and put into 12pm flight. We are now stuck in Brisbane. Thought Virgin would be more accommodating to at least give us access to the Lounge for our kids to rest or at least a meal for the delay. I will never travel with Virgin ever again. Do yourself a favour, fly with Garuda which has been excellent (travelled more than 5 times from Sydney to Bali) or Jetstar and save yourself some money. Virgin is a budget airline that pretend to be a full service airline

### "consistent at delaying flights."
Sydney to Melbourne. Lousy airline. The only thing they are consistent at is delaying flights. I would say over 90% of my flights do not leave on time. Suffering a 4 hour delay today on a 90 minute flight to Melbourne. Was advised about the first 2 hour delay but only found out about the second delay once I was at the boarding gate. Have missed what I was travelling down for and half a day of work. No compensation or offer to use the lounge etc. Really useless. Domestic flights like this should run smoothly. Never experienced this when I used to travel regionally on air New Zealand. Also have been given a seat in the last row of the plane for my troubles.

### "I am super disappointed"
Perth to Sydney. I rarely leave reviews and let a lot slide, but considering how much it costs to fly domestically with Virgin Australia I am super disappointed. Perth to Sydney is a long flight and to not have in flight entertainment is a huge let down. It's fine if it's a short flight but this isn't. On the way here from Sydney I was sat in a seat with a faulty usb charging port and the flight crew weren't interested in hearing about it. The tray table was filthy. I think this will be the last time I fly this airline. It's rapidly going down hill. I remember when Virgin Australia was on par with Qantas, now it's not even close.

### "No service with a smile here"
Check-in ground staff - excellent service with a smile. Lounge - small selection of savoury and sweet breakfast options. Boarding - terrible. Unfriendly staff who did not manage passenger queues well. Non-priority passengers filled the priority lanes. When it came to boarding, priority passengers had to squeeze through the crowd. Staff simply shouted for non-priority staff to remove themselves. No service with a smile here. On board, headsets not provided upon arrival but made available upon request. Entertainment system not working initially - no content could be displayed except menu. Crew had to reset Wifi. Average selection of movies when entertainment system started working. Tablet was a bit faulty as screen turns off with the slightest movement. At meal time, crew had to ask passengers if they were willing to change their main as they had only 4 portions of the salad (whilst 8 wanted salad). Starter of soup was delicious but no selection of breads (contrary to menu). Just given a white roll. Everyone else in business class got their drink except me - had to request again. I also heard another passenger ask for cutlery because he was given just a cheese platter but no cutlery. Main dish of salad is average. Dessert was not offered and I asked if dessert had been served. Staff said no. I asked for the cheese platter. They did not even bother to open the packet of crackers when serving. Multiple economy passengers came into the business class area to use the toilets, using business cabin as thoroughfare - nobody said anything. Seats not comfortable. Despite max recline, my back was aching after a couple of hours. Shape of seat seems to result in a "slouching" posture. The airfare for VA business is more than 5x that of economy and we don't get very comfortable seats. Virgin Australia Voyeur says "with business class, enjoy priority check-in, stylish lounge facilities and superior service". However, on this flight, VA has provided sloppy, inferior service to business - we dont get served the full course of lunch and have to constantly make requests for items that are usually provided as a bare minimum.

### "a strict policy not to help"
Sydney to Cairns. Worst customer service experienced for any service. Left a watch in seat pocket of plane, unfortunately didn't realise until plane had left for next destination (Sydney). Spoke to ground staff at Cairns airport and not found when plane cleaned, not surprising for thin item at bottom of seat pocket. Was advised that plane was on route to Sydney due in 30 mins, they gave a number to call and said they should be able to check pocket when plane landed. Realistically as virgin staff they could easily have rung the gate but I accepted what seemed like logical advice. The number was for Sydney airport with recorded message that could leave message but no return call would be made. From there was just a nightmare trying to contact anyone that could help with this simplest request. Virgin deliberatley don't have any number to call, when called general enquiry line flatly refused to give any number to call or connect to apropriate virgin staff at airport. After a number of calls all ending with being put on hold for long periods and then just connected to the same answering machine at Sydney airport never to any Virgin staff at airport. On one of a number of calls finally got put through to a phone that was answered but still a non-virgin number at the airport-. They commented that continually frustrated by Virgin Australia just sending calls to airport when items are on plane and that I had to explain to Virgin there is nothing non-virgin ground staff could do for an item on a plane. It is likely the watch was not found in cleaning plane again in Sydney and went on to who knows how many different destinations. A simple call to the gate or message to crew to check a seat pocket of a known seat about to land would have been the simplest thing to do but they have a strict policy not to help. So if you are in seat 4A of a Virgin flight check the seat pocket you may find a Garmin Fenix 3 HR.

### "experience was superb"
Sydney to Perth to connect to South African Airways. I'm rarely on Virgin Australia but the whole experience was superb. FA's were great and it was a very light load so had the whole row to myself. A new aircraft, the IFE was great and time slipped by very quickly. One peculiar issue and I have noted this on Jetstar as well. The seats are leather so inevitably if in recline you start to slide forward a bit. F Highly satisfying overall.

### "crew made the flight worthwhile"
Flew Sydney to Melbourne with Virgin Australia. A pleasant flight. Check in was quite swift. The plane left on time and the staff were very helpful, friendly and well organised. For a full service airline the free food was very limited. Just dry biscuits and hummus dip. Qantas is much better, particularly in the evening. But the crew made the flight worthwhile.

### "staff were very friendly and efficient"
I enjoyed the flight from Melbourne to Sydney with Virgin Australia. Check in time was reasonable. The plane left on time and the staff were very friendly and efficient. I appreciated the free drinks. Food was very limited for dinner time. Just cheese and biscuits. Not nearly as good as Qantas on a similar flight.

### "staff were of little help"
Brisbane to Sydney. Second time in 3 days that flights have been cancelled 5 hour wait in Sydney and 1 hour wait in Brisbane to return. I requested complimentary access to the lounge for my 5 hour wait but was told that Virgin don’t do that. No explanation for the delays and booking staff were of little help. Remember you are not moving aircraft, you are moving PEOPLE

### "Unbelievably poor customer service"
Sydney to Ballina. Unbelievably poor customer service and no contingency planning from Virgin. 10am flight to Ballina cancelled. No notification until we arrived at Sydney airport after having checked our car in long term parking. Text message arrived at 8.05am said nothing about a cancellation, just a link with a booking to Coolangatta boarding at 3.40pm and a link to a further flight booking to Ballina. Only realised the flight had been cancelled when we checked the Departures sign at the airport. First day of school holidays so absolute bedlam at check in and no alternative flight options as only one other flight per day and it was fully booked. Upon making enquiries at bag drop we discovered that the airline knew the flight was cancelled at 3.30am due to engineering problems but didn’t advise passengers until after 8am. Followed up with Ticketing after dropping bags in at 9.30am only to be told that the only option was 4pm flight to Collongatta and that there was a further error - connecting flight to Ballina on our boarding pass was not actually a flight but a 90 minute bus ride from Coolangatta to Ballina. We were expecting to arrive in Byron Bay at 12 noon, will now be arriving around 8pm tonight. Supposed to pick up rental car at Ballina at 11.30am. Have had to make alternate arrangements as Ballina rental car desk closes at 4pm and we will not be arriving now till 7.15pm. Virgin Ticketing were unable to explain why there was no contingency plane available across entire Virgin fleet and why the shuttles from Gold Coast were only organised to leave at 3 hourly intervals when people inconvenienced were arriving on a hourly basis into that airport. The only compensation offered by Virgin for the 6 hour we will now spend at the airport was a single meal voucher worth $16. Totally unacceptable response. You need a fleet contingency plan for situations like this.

### "worst airline I’ve ever travelled"
Denpasar Bali to Brisbane. Virgin Australia is worst airline I’ve ever travelled on. $1000 for two one way flights from DPS To BNE! The staff were so rude, miserable unapproachable staff. The flight was absolutely freezing with no blankets or pillows. 3 hours into the flight around 20 people were coughing, including myself and partner. We live in the UK and currently on our honeymoon. My husband is now ill in bed and our honeymoon is ruined.

### "certainly never fly them again"
Gold Coast to Melbourne. We arrived at Gold Coast airport 90 minutes prior to our flight’s scheduled departure. After dropping our bags off we saw that the flight was delayed 15 minutes. We took kids to toilet and then gave them some lunch. The departure gate was in the middle of a food court. There was no overhead electrical board above the gate to indicate when boarding would commence. Around 40 minutes before the new departure time we wandered over to a bookstore a few metres away. Around 10 minutes later we heard a boarding call for our flight. Having 2 young kids, I raced them to the toilet before boarding, because plane toilets are so awkward with little ones. There was another announcement around 2 minutes after the first, saying it was the final call. My daughter was still in the toilet, so we waited for her, listening out in case they paged us. They paged another family but not us. We got to the gate 10minutes after the first call at the latest and were told we were disembarked and that we had to go out and speak to the ticket desk. We could see the plane and we must have only been a couple of minutes behind the last passenger but the lady refused to let us board, despite us explaining why we were a couple of minutes late. We raced out to the front of the airport and were told we could board the next flight but would have to buy new tickets (for $1000) or wait 6 hours for a flight that would cost us $760. The staff showed absolutely no sympathy and made no effort to help us. It would have cost them nothing to let us board the next flight for free. All 3 of the staff members we dealt with, were also quite rude saying that all 140 of the other passengers had managed to board and why should we be any different? One asked us sarcastically why if we had arrived 90 minutes prior to the flight, we had chosen to take the kids to the toilet just before boarding. There was no humanity in the way they treated us. I don’t recommend flying Virgin Australia and will certainly never fly them again. They’re cheap but there needs to be more flexibility and training on how to treat customers and meet their needs.

### "Seat not comfortable"
Brisbane to Perth. Boarding good. Non-priority passengers who tried to board when only priority members called were stopped. In flight service was average. Courteous stewardess when she was serving. Will not proactively check with passengers though. An economy class passenger was allowed into business class to use the toilet and he ended up chatting with the stewardess for a long time. I had to use the call button for someone to clear my plates. Seat not comfortable. Boeing 737 business class seats are not comfortable for flights across the country. Food was vry good. Menu seems to be the same for a calendar month, but high quality. Entertainment a limited selection. Virgin Australia recently updated its entertainment app, which is not very responsive. Previous app was more stable.

### "uncomfortable for long haul"
Perth to Brisbane. Great inflight service. The steward was ready to help, and proactively checks to see if you require more sparkling water. Food was tasty and in generous portions. The cheese platter never fails to impress. Entertainment is average but it does get updated on a regular basis. I was given a tablet with parental lock activated. No cabin wifi unfortunately. The seats as usual are a disappointment. The recline of Virgin Australia 737s is unimpressive and uncomfortable for long haul flights across Australia. I can see its place for shorter flights across cities on the East coast but not across the country. I only fly Virgin Australia business for work but with its unimpressive recline, I dont think it is worth paying 3x to 4x more on business class just for a bit more food and legroom.

### " will never fly Virgin again"
Adelaide to Auckland via Melbourne. The baggage handlers are extremely rough. They ripped 2 of our bags and they arrive on the conveyor belt with a small amount of plastic wrap to keep them together. Another 'trolley dolly' suitcase was very broken, they plastic handles were ripped open and almost removed from the suitcase itself. The Virgin baggage policy requires all receipts and a JP to sight and sign all information. Our suitcase had travelled the world several times over 5 years and never been damaged, we also do not have the receipt. I will never fly Virgin again.

### "Food and drinks were amazing"
Small 8 seat business section felt secluded and quiet. Flight attendants great on both flights. Friendly and very generous with drinks and snacks. Our attendant on the flight back to Perth gave us extra snacks for when we got home as we had a very long connection in Brisbane and total trip was 24hrs. Velocity lounge in Brisbane was a good spot to kill the hours waiting for our next flight. Food and drinks were good and as business class customers could spend the 7 hours there. Food and drinks on flights were amazing, particularly the 3 course dinner on Brisbane-Perth segment. The cheese was delicious! The one major downside were the seats on the 737. Limited recline and very firm. My partner who has a bad back has been in a lot of pain since we got home.

### "did her level best"
Having missed our connecting Virgin flight out of Brisbane to Canberra for a one night stay (family reunion at a cousin's 40th birthday celebrations), we faced a 7 hour wait before being able to continue to Canberra. This would be enough to steal the jam out of anyone's donut! However, a lovely Virgin employee tried to get us onto other flights and did her level best to make our enforced stay at Brisbane Airport more comfortable. My wife and I really appreciated all that the Virgin staff did to assist us. Top notch.

### "Never fly Virgin again"
Adelaide to Perth. Luggage damage. I flew out with a new luggage piece - got to Adelaide - luggage all good. Return journey back to Perth, landed in Perth with a busted support bar between wheels - made it difficult to wheel. In getting home noticed that a item inside was also damaged - packed the curlers very well - with all heavy jackets. But this must have been hit hard to not only break the bar but what was inside. Oh and virgin said no. It could have happened anywhere. Never fly Virgin again - they suggested I should have had private insurance !

### "keep us updated"
Christchurch to Brisbane. Not impressed. Arrived at airport with 3 hours to spare and once arrived saw that our plane was delayed by 1 hour 45 mins. Already annoyed, we moved to departure lounge to await boarding for the new scheduled time and delayed once again. I still don’t even see a plane. Asked a crew member and they said due to sickness they had to fly 2 staff from Auckland. We are still waiting over 2 hours late and counting. If I could give you any advise please inform your customers and keep us updated. Everyone is sitting here wondering what is going on and not one person has offered an explanation, I had to come up and ask myself. I can hear other people around me complaining about the same thing! Keep us updated, we have plans and a life too.

### "experience was not pleasant"
Brisbane to Sydney. I have traveled with Virgin three times in 8 days and all of them are delayed. Is that just the odds? Quite misleading as 'full service flight' with cheese and crackers as meal. Very limited entertainment options as well. The experience was not pleasant overall.

### "Flight delayed again"
Not Verified |  Brisbane to Auckland. Flight delayed again. What is it with Virgin and delayed flights. Only some passengers were given vouchers. Staff rude because of delay. Made to be at gate at 2.30pm so we get to sit for 2.5 hours and flight is delayed further until nearly 5pm. Poor.

### "terrible customer service"
Perth to Melbourne. I only fly with Virgin if my ticket is paid for. Every flight with Virgin reminds me, to never fly with them. Terrible customer service. Very rude or uncaring. Planes' are very outdated. No screens or USB ports. Back seats limited for movement and very uncomfortable. Usually have a sore back by the time I get off. I have to pay extra for comfortable seats? Flight entertainment usually not working or constantly interrupted. I do not recommend this airline.

### "a joke of an airline"
Virgin Australia was an absolute joke, today my flight was ment to be at 1.45pm it then got delayed untill 6.00pm so I got permission by staff to leave the airport I then received a phone call at 3.15 saying I was boarding at 3.40pm. Luckily i got there in time but then we sat on the airplane for 45 minutes with no aircon just to be told to get off again and now I am sitting here still at 5.04 with no clue when we may be getting home. This is the second time in less then a month this has happened and all they gave me was a $16 voucher for food and water for over a 5 hour wait - what a joke of an airline.

### "I will still recommend"
Sydney to Perth. Check-in through the Virgin Australia’s app is straight forward. However, Sydney airport still lacks the automated luggage drop off counters in newer Virgin Australia airport such as Perth. Boarding at Sydney Airport is quick and efficient. Once on board the aircraft, it is clean and tidy. The cabin crew is friendly and warm as well. An hour into the flight, dinner is served with two choices: sweet and sour chicken with fried rice or vegetarian dhal curry. Each meal choice comes with chocolate mud cake and choice of beverages. I chose the chicken stir fry and it is delicious and overall a pleasant experience. On Virgin Australia A330-200, there are USB port available to charge your devices and there is a moderately fine inflight entertainment selection. Overall it is an uneventful flight but I will still recommend flying with Virgin Australia over its competitors, taking into consideration its price and the perks of its frequent flyer program, Velocity.

### "I can enjoy the flatbed"
I bid for an upgrade for this red eye flight from Perth to Melbourne, and have successfully done so even on a Gateway ticket. The Business experience began with a priority check-in at the Perth domestic airport and access to Virgin Australia lounge. As it was 10.30pm when I access the lounge, food selection is limited so I ordered a cup of soy hot chocolate to help me get ready for sleep on the flight. Boarding at Perth airport is quick and efficient and there is a separate aerobridge for business class passenger. The aircraft is well maintained and clean. There are two pillows on my seat upon arrival. On each Business class seat, it has a compartment to store iPad, to charge devices and has plenty of leg room. The crew is friendly and offers me a selection of drinks and brings me the supper and breakfast menu. The crew has also taken my breakfast and coffee order before taking off. Virgin Australia ‘The Business’ lives up to its name. There are three default configurations on a touch screen panel where you can adjust your seat. The 180º flat bed is perhaps one of the best features I enjoy on Virgin Australia’s A330-200. It is comfortable to sleep in. I skip the supper in favour of sleeping on the comfortable seat. An hour before landing, the crew brought my breakfast made up of muesli, yoghurt, croissant, bread roll with butter, jam and marmalade. The coffee which I order prior to taking off is served too. Breakfast is delicious and overall a pleasant experience. Just before landing, the cabin crew distributes warm towel. This is perhaps the first time I wish the flight was longer so I can enjoy the flatbed and other features on this business class.

### "No clue what to do"
Not Verified |  Melbourne - Los Angeles, August 4/5, 2018. Flight cancellation. August 4 flight cancelled just before take off at 11.35am. Virgin Staff, after a completely uncaring attitude for Check In process, went into meltdown once advice of flight cancellation was public. No processes in place. No clue what to do. Rude staff. Took 7+ hours to sort out the mess. Claim "they have never had this happen before", people out of their depth. August 5, another rude set of staff at check in. Inept evolved to incredulous. Plane scheduled to leave at 11.35. Multiple gate changes and departs eventually hour later. All the patronising apologies is not good enough Virgin Australia. Think long and hard about using Virgin (Melb to LAX). Worth paying the extra and go with Qantas. (Thought we'd give VA a go and won't use them again.) 3/10 and that's generous!

### "never fly again with them"
Sydney to Nadi. We had 8:30 flight. Pilot said there were engine problems as soon as we departed the gate. Took 2-3 hours to return to the gate. Then they said we would fly at 1230. Then at 12 they said it was cancelled. What annoyed me the most is that when we were exiting, the staff didn’t tell us what was going on. Ie flight has been cancelled, go here and rebook. They just said you need to go through customs to exit then baggage collection. The call centre were very confusing and didn’t provide accurate information, they were getting confused with dates and delays for the day before. Hopeless, will never fly again with them.

### "my bag missed my plane"
Sydney to Darwin. Upon arriving in Darwin at 2.00 pm I found out that my bag missed my plane due to the carousel breaking down in Sydney Virgin staff advised me that it would be arriving that night at 8.00pm and they would call me to arrange dropping off Well no call that night , tried to contact Virgin at Darwin and find out they have all gone home Call the National assistance number at 9.00 pm and get told to call back tomorrow Went to airport next day at 11.30 when they open and it takes Virgin staff 30 minutes on the phone to locate the bag - it was given to a Taxi Driver with 2 other peoples bags the night before The Taxi driver has not tried to call me and taken 2 bags home and is in bed. My bag is brought to the airport at 12.40 by Taxi drivers wife After lodging a complaint with Virgin upon returning to Sydney all they have to say is that shit happens and they will pass on complaint to Darwin! We wasted half a day in Darwin when we could have been heading off somewhere else.

### "cancel or delay flights"
Adelaide to Perth. Delayed flight twice. Original departure time 14:25, this was delayed day before departure to 16:50, day of departure flight delayed again until 18:05. They always cancel or delay flights since they are losing money. The flight to Adelaide I suspect wasn't full so they have swapped the plan out to minimise their loss. Save yourself the headache and fly Qantas - bit more expensive but at least they depart at the time stated when you purchase the ticket!

### "no customer service"
Sydney to Brisbane. Virgin Australia does not know what Customer Service is! I was about to start my semester abroad in Brisbane (I am from Europe) and had my final flight with VA from Sydney to Brisbane, and the one hour flight was already delayed 30 minutes, when we arrived, 75% of the luggage did not. We immediately contacted the Baggage Service and gave our details in order for them to bring the luggage to the accommodation. They said it will not take longer than one day - fine. However, my luggage has not arrived the second day - I tried to call the baggage service hotline multiple times, but no one ever picks up the phone. I left a message, I sent two emails and one complaint, no one answers. I called the Customer Service Hotline - had an hour call and got told to call the baggage service and write a complaint (which I already did)... they do not work together internally or where able to check any information, which is a joke as such a big company! As I just arrived in this country and do not own anything besides my carry on, I had to buy clothes and everything I need for the everyday life which is pretty expensive in Australia. After four days, suddenly my bags arrived at the door, but there was no apology besides a ridiculous paper tag 'SORRY'. Ever since, they have not replied to my emails, not called back or done anything. Its been 13 days by now - I sent them another complaint with my expenses and receipts - no sign of any customer service at all. I am more than upset, disappointed and annoyed - its not my fault, that my baggage is lost, I had ridiculous expenses (as a student especially hard to deal with) and I have spent so much time on trying to get in contact with this poorly managed airline. Never again!

### "An absolute disgrace"
Denpasar to Sydney. We got to the airport over 2 hrs early , looked for the scales, all out of order and stood in the checkin line waiting to check in, 3 staff counters for all virgin flights, with 3 priority, 3 online staff, who had nobody 98% of the time and did nothing. We were finally pulled through the crowd to check in 5 people to be told we were 7 kilos overweight on 2 bags. Move things around, as we went to try, we were told quite rudely to pay $250 or lose our flights as we were out of time. I paid the money and hurried through the airport as our plane was boarding, this delay was not our fault. It was freezing on the plane and I asked to buy the blanket packages for the 5 of us to get told sorry sold out. And we are not turning the air down. Really cramped and uncomfortable flight due to cold. We landed in Sydney to a show of the baggage staff throwing our bags from the plane to the trolleys and quite hard. This airline has the most disgusting Customer service experienced in my life. We fly every 6-8 months and will never fly virgin again even in an emergency. Stay well away from this airline. Told there was inflight entertainment to find out you need to buy the packages as well. An absolute disgrace.

### "No service with a smile"
Perth to Brisbane. No service with a smile from ground service, very abrupt. Lounge was good and even the cook was friendly when he talked about his thai chicken soup. Typical 737 implies seat recline is limited, although spacious. Food was good. Cheese platter was most memorable. However, as my other flight with VA, the fish was not on the menu as well. Entertainment was average. Selection is not the greatest considering such a long flight.

### "Overall great service"
Brisbane to Perth. Friendly host and good food. Seat was spacious but limited on how much recline one can do. A bonus was free Wifi on the plane. I was really disappointed at the menu. The flight did not stock a menu item and ran out of the cheese platter. The host tried to provide an alternative using economy class cheese. Overall great service, not so good on the seats and poor on the menu availability.

### "exceeded my expectations"
Not Verified | I frequently travel to Asia on Air New Zealand, SQ, and Qantas and I had low expectations of VA given the cheap fare. I was wrong. They exceeded my expectations, crew were excellent - attentive and funny. Meals were above what I see on Air New Zealand, and were better out of Hong Kong than Melbourne which was a surprise. I was offered a second meal by crew as there were leftovers - this has never happened to me before. Excellent choice of films and TV. Seats were comfortable. The only drag was having to board at a remote gate in Melbourne. Took a while.

### "I will never recommend Virgin"
Melbourne to Adelaide. Shocking Service. Been at the airport for my 9am flight and still waiting with no communication. Flight is now suppose to depart at 5:20pm. I use Virgin Australia for business not because I want to but my work has corporate deals otherwise I would have never used them. Flew with Jetstar and Tiger many times which is much cheaper and has always been a good experience. If you prepare to wait at Melbourne airport due to Virgin please go ahead. I will never recommend Virgin.

### "flight was enjoyable"
Townsville to Brisbane. First time on Virgin Australia so I was a bit wary, had no cause really. Staff at check in were friendly, didnt take up the offer to have assistance, will next time. The staff at the gate took a group of us on first because of assistance issues. They were friendly, courteous, and was very attentive. They arranged for transport at the end of the flight which was waiting at the gate, thank heavens. The entire flight was enjoyable and i will travel with them again.

### "flight was 3.5 hours delay"
Melbourne to Hong Kong return. The onward flight was more than 1 hour delay and the return flight was 3.5 hours delay. Flightstat has showed more than 1/3 of extreme long delay on both sectors. It is a shocking statistics and is the worse for direct flight of the sector. The food is of a budget airline standard and the entertainment option is limited compared with the other airline of the same route. Cabin service is quite good and I do understand the pressure they have to take to handle constant long delay flight. The fare is in the cheapest for direct flight normally about $200-$300 cheaper for direct flight. If you are a budget traveller and have plenty of time this flight can be a good option. If timing is a vital part of your journey, it is better to avoid the flight at all cost. Unfortunately, I am the latter one even I have put in 2 hours as a safeguard. There is one thing I don't understand, The flights for this sector is either on-time of seriously delay but not in the middle - small delay.

### "recommend not to use them"
Melbourne to Sydney with Virgin Austalia connecting to Air Canada onto Vancouver. Waited in queue for 20 mins at airport. Only One person doing international flights check-in. Two queues one for domestic one for international Was told to stay in international queue. One person directing people between the international. And domestic check-in desks did not appear to know what she was doing. Informed her that I was on the 6:45 flight Mel to Sydney, just told me gates closed 1 min ago Sent me to virgin desk without trying the check in desk. Time was 6:15 Virgin customer desk just said that I have to speak to Air Canada even though this was their flight. So missed flight could not use complete return ticket. Lost $1400.00 unhelpful airline will avoid them and recommend not to use them.

### "how disappointing"
Sydney to Coffs Harbour. I cannot express how disappointing this airline is. I checked in online and thought that I only needed to get to the airport 40 minutes before departure. Allowing for Vigin poor service you need to arrive 1.5 hours prior to departure. This is not communicated on the Webjet ticket or in the Virgin text messages or emails. Two hard faced women at the 'Service Desk ' were monumentally indifferent. I had to buy another ticket. This was $40 more than than the same ticket online Absolutely shameless!

### "with so much attitude"
Came to Brisbane for work with a Qantas flight and was amazed and how much more organised and friendly the staff were in comparison to Virgin. As soon as I come to the lounge the woman greeting you to scan your ticket man handled my phone. While holding my phone in my hand the guy outside shouted “oi no phones” with no warning and with so much attitude. I got on to the aircraft and there are a seat and floor full of crumbs. Guess I will be flying Qantas from now who offer a beautiful breakfast, not just a protein ball.

### "an uneventful flight"
Melbourne to Perth. Boarding was efficient and quick, despite there was only one ground staff at the gate. Virgin Australia’s B737-800 does not have any IFE or USB port so if you are planning to watch the IFE through on-board WiFi streaming, I strongly recommend other passengers to bring a power pack to charge your personal devices. Cabin was clean and fresh when I board the plane. An hour into flight, dinner is served. Choice was chicken with vegetable and rice, or vegetarian penne pasta. Dinner comes with drinks and chocolate mousse as dessert. I chose the chicken with vegetable and rice. Chicken was tender and well marinated, the hot meal was overall delicious although the vegetable was a little overcooked. After dinner, crew went around for few rounds of beverages and water. Overall an uneventful flight, and the flight arrived in Perth on time.

### "staff efficient and warm"
Melbourne to Cairns. Why anyone would choose Qantas domestic business over this is beyond me. Efficient check in, nice lounge with good breakfast, easy boarding, way more leg room and comfort, much better entertainment options and more. The staff were efficient and warm serving a delicious meal leisurely for the 3 hour trip. Had literally the exact opposite on the same aircraft on Qantas. Great job Virgin, rather sad for Brand Q!

### "booked an isle seat for it to be changed"
Perth to Port Hedland. Time and time again they've failed to provide a quality service. Prime example was today. I booked and was in the process of paying for an extra leg room isle seat. The payment had been processed just for them to tell me that my seat had been changed to a middle seat after payment process. Then just to be told that they can't change to any isle seats since the plane was full. As it turns out later one of my work colleague's got the same leg room seat across from me for nothing. Why did I even bother. Why does anyone even bother with this painful company. This isn't the first time I've booked an isle seat for it to be changed. A couple of months ago I used the virgin website to book myself an isle seat before flying. The seat was confirmed, just for me to arrive at the airport and to be told that my seat had been changed to a middle seat. After my flight I called customer service and the answer I was given was to not assign my frequent flyer number to my booking and that should sort the problem out next time. Buyer be prepared to fight for any decency from this mob.

### Check-in from Hobart is abysmal"
Darwin to Hobart via Melbourne. We regularly get this flight. The breakfast breakfast snack invariably consists of sugary items such as choc muffins, sweet yoghurt etc. Kids like it, adults don't. The snack is all you get despite the flight being over 4 hours - not even a 2nd cup of tea. Check-in on return flight from Hobart airport is abysmal. Often queues stand for long periods with no-one on counter despite saying they open 90 mins before departure. Then a single staff arrives to check in 3 queues. There seems to be a problem booking on an ipad if you are a Velocity member. I have missed out on sale fares because of this. Get no reply when filling out complaint form. Virgin call centre rarely resolves problems or answers questions, often just refer you to Velocity which has limited hours. Last time the call centre told me their system doesn't allow booking on an iphone or ipad and can only be done on a desktop! They said they were soon getting a new system which fixes this problem. I'm sure this isn't correct.

### "such an unreasonable airline"
Wellington to Brisbane. This is one of the most unreasonable and unhelpful airlines I have ever flown. Zero tolerance for a bag even slightly over the 23kg limit and the charge was extortionate. Never before have I flown with such an unreasonable airline.

### "I will never fly Virgin anywhere"
I was booked to fly From Brisbane to Perth on Virgin Australia. I decided to ask my wife if she would like to join me and she was keen so we booked her a ticket on the same flight , and we linked the ticket so Virgin Australia would know we were travelling together. In any case there is only 2 families in Australia with my surname so it should be obvious to anybody we were together. Nonetheless we linked the tickets. Because I was due at the gold coast at 7.00am the following morning, we had hired a car and would need to drive for 1 hour or so to get to our destination. We arrived at the airport early. We were extremely surprised for find out they had downsized the aircraft to save money as it was not fully booked (this is fair enough as long as you are not inconveniencing your customers). My wife could not check in and when we inquired, we were told she was not on the flight. She had been bumped off the flight as there was not enough seats on the new plane. Despite our best efforts, an the efforts of our travel agent we could not get them to reconsider this decision. Apparently it is made in operations, and operations is like heaven and they "never make mistakes". I could not even get them to call operations. I even showed the very presentable but superbly unhelpful staff how to use a telephone. But alas all we were confronted with was smiling resistance to any for of assistance. Their training is impressive! it must be hard to be that intentionally unhelpful with a smile for 30 minutes, and I mean all 4 staff we dealt with. Incredible and almost surreal. In the end we gave up in frustration and I put my wife in a taxi to the Qantas terminal, she caught the next Qantas flight and beat me to Brisbane.To rub salt in the wound , Virgin will not refund my wife's ticket. Can you believe they insist she uses the ticket on another flight. It is like being spared from execution and then being invited back to death row. No thanks. I will never fly Virgin anywhere in the world. I suggest you learn from my experience and save yourself the stress also. PS: I would score Virgin zero if the system would allow it.

### "passengers were upset with the service"
In January my family and I (20 of us) flew with Virgin to Bali. I always fly Qantas, however we thought we were able to find a better deal with Virgin so wanted to give them a try. The flight experience was absolutely horrible as we were not warned that there would be no inflight entertainment, food or blankets on this long haul flight. To top it all off the flight crew were extremely rude and in a foul mood. Most passengers were upset with the service and they did not once try to please their customers in any way shape or form. After our terrible experience we tried to contact Virgin customer service/head office and they were of no help and didn't want to accomodate or hear anything about it.

### "not reply to any claim"
Lost luggage on Virgin Australia and they would not reply to any claim or damages. We arrived at Queenstown at about 4pm on Mar 23 2018. My wife and I had a trip from Queenstown across NZ to the North Part of the country over a 7 day period. Upon arrival I learned that my bag was lost. They told me to call a number the next day to track. Our whole trip was in flux because of the bag. The next day, no answer. called other Virgin Australia but they had no help. I drove back to airport and learned that no one comes in until 1300 that day. Was never told that. Since i was already there i waited to learn that the bag would likely be on the 1600 flight that day. Ironically the flight was late and unfortunately learned it was not there. We had waited all day for it. We had some scheduled hikes that we had pre reserved that we went on, I rented some gear to make it through. Instead of following our trip up New Zealand we had to go back to Queenstown to get my bag. Ended up losing a lot of time in our vacation and ontop of it all i could not get them to respond to the cover the damages, i.e. rented materials, unused bookings, etc.

### "in-flight meals included"
Sydney to Perth. Pleasantly surprised. Standard 23kg baggage allowance and impressed by the in-flight meals included. Not huge portions and no frozen bread rolls, but really tasty. This is now my game changer for choosing an airline.

### "flight arrived on time"
Coffs Harbour to Sydney. I was allocated an economy X seat at check in, which provides 40% more leg room compared to the standard economy seat. Virgin Australia offers Platinum Velocity members economy X seats complimentary however an additional $35 fee is charged for this sector if selected during the booking process for all other guests, We boarded the flight about 25 mins prior to departure and were greeted with smiles by the cabin crew.The seat was comfortable and the additional leg room made the cabin feel noticeably roomier. There was a great selection of Movies and TV shows available through its Wireless entertainment system on board. During the flight were offered a choice of complimentary water, orange juice, coffee or tea along with a small snack. Virgin Australia charge $3-$4 for Soft drinks Beer prices start at $8 for the majority of its domestic services,with the exception of weekday flights that are scheduled between (5pm-7pm). I was seated on the left hand side of the plane and I had great views of the Hunter Valley Northern beaches and Sydney CBD on the flight down. The flight arrived on time and the taxi to the gate was relatively short. There are a couple of areas where they could improve their service. Provide seatback USB ports on all its short haul fleet for passengers to charge portable devices. Provide complimentary sugar free soft drinks/carbonated mineral water to passengers on domestic flights.

### "not a full service airline"
Melbourne to Brisbane I got a 1 mini (Lunchbox size) box of 4 mini Cheese and 4 mini crackers, and nothing more. For a full service paid ticket $190 (with baggage) they are not a full service airline anymore. Also the ground service person who issued my ticket did not check my I.D for my ticket. Just printed it and gave it like she didn't want to work. What a terrible attitude to her work! Fail after fail.

### "appalled by the service"
Sydney to Cairns. I was appalled by the service received during an unfortunate incident. The flight I was meant to be traveling back to Sydney got canceled due to technical reasons and passengers were asked to disembark the flight and go back to check-in for further information. After an hour wait in the queue, we were given an accommodation and were told that we would be picked up and delivered at our hotel in about 10 mins. Waited at the pick up area for an hour before any shuttle rocked up and even after they arrived we had to wait half hour for the shuttle to start. At the end of all this we we finally reached our destination only to find all restaurants were closed, the room was disgusting- spiders on bed, windows that didn’t have a proper screen (someone from outside could see the room and the bed was next to the window and to top it all up - it had connecting doors that could be opened; I opened mine for reassurance to see if it’s accessible and it to my horror it opened to the next room. I called the customer service number on the information sheet I was given (“with the statement- for further assistance”) only to receive a apology-Sorry not our problem. I agree - not your problem; mine for choosing to fly with your company on every trip I make! I took a cab to the airport at my own expense as I was not willing to sleep at such unsafe standards especially while I was traveling alone. At the airport finally after waiting for another half hour (thanks to one compassionate aircrew) got to speak to a ground staff and was assigned to a different hotel which I must say was acceptable. My thoughts- if a frequent traveller like myself was treated with such indifference (loyalty BTW is not a virtue that’s rewarded but one that’s exploited) what was the plight of a naive traveler? Why the double standards? Why are some people given standard accommodation while others were given sub standard ones? I understand if the business class passenger was put up in a five star hotel but why the double standard between passengers in economy class (mind you not premium) ... if trying to justify the cost of the ticket- I can assure you that I had bought the most priciest one in economy class. If it was not the loyalty or the price of the ticket, then what was the deciding factor?

### "check-in and bag drop was a bit disorganised"
VA901 from Sydney to Brisbane, flight was good, however check-in and bag drop was a bit disorganised on Friday 13th April. It was not clear which line was for full check-in, and which one was for bag drop only. I spent about 10 minutes in a queue I didn't need to be in because I had already used a self-serve kiosk. After realising the bag drop only queue, the crowd control person called people on my flight forward, but then on seeing me said "Not too many people, get back in line" after I lost my spot in the line, I of course was rather annoyed by that. But when I did finally get to drop my bag it only took 15 seconds as expected. I had friends travelling later that day, who said it took them 45 minutes just to drop a bag. I can see from other reviews that other people find the check-in and bag drop counters disorganised. If they understandably want to encourage more people to use self-serve check-in like I do because it is more efficient, then they must be clear on which lines are for bag drop only, and which line is for full check-in where it could take upwards of 10 minutes for one staff member to check in a group of about 6. In Sydney on Friday 13th April, you had at least one staff member who was serving/alternating two lines of customers. However on the return leg, I flew VA954 Brisbane to Sydney, the check-in bag drop counters were excellent at Brisbane Airport, it was quite clear which counters were for full check-in and which counters were for bag drop only.

### "recommend this airline"
Sydney to Brisbane on April 19, 2018. I was even offered an Economy X seat for the mid day flight! A fairly large pax (lots of passengers in economy), which meant snack service was even more efficient. Wonderful staff, and a wonderful flight with Virgin Australia. I would definitely recommend this airline to all of my colleagues and friends!

### "So disappointed"
Melbourne to Los Angeles. Unimpressed and irritated by VA customer service. First boarding was a disaster, disorganized, and very lengthy. There's zones on the boarding pass for a reason. No wifi on either flight. 2 meals were provided and both times the attendant notifies us that our selection of meals is gone. No beverages offered other than the bottle of water at boarding. So disappointed. I've never felt like third class traveler more than on this trip. I'll never recommend the airline to anyone.

### "pay extra AUD 120 per baggage"
Sydney to Queenstown. I was shocked when I was checking my baggage at the counter and told that I need to pay extra AUD 120 per baggage. I did not see any online baggage purchase option when I was trying do online check-in the night before. Staff service was good, but it did not help, the service did not worth the money.

### "flight was smooth and uneventful"
Melbourne to Hobart. Compared with Qantas the check-in process during peak hour in Melbourne was cumbersome. After printing off a bag tag (and not all the machines did this) we had to wait in a long and slow-moving bag drop queue -- no quick self bag drop here! The flight was smooth and uneventful, with a drink and small snack served by the friendly crew. We arrived on time and the baggage was available soon after.

### "never fly Virgin Australia again"
Perth to Sydney. On the 29th March 2018 we were told the aircraft had issues, we were then stuck at Sydney airport for 9 hours until they found us another flight, total travel time was 18 hours from home to Perth. Then on the 2nd April 2018 we are being told the same thing. I will never fly with Virgin Australia again.

### "A pleasant experience"
Adelaide to Gold Coast via Sydney. A pleasant experience with Virgin flight although it delays but we still arrived Gold Coast. One of the things that i could not ignore is the free Wifi on board is awesome. I can browse facebook, instagram pretty smoothly. Highly Recommended but it is a bit pricy compared to other airlines. However, the snacks taste bad.

### "Very unhappy customer"
Melbourne to Hobart. I used to hate flying with Jetstar, but today the experience I had at Virgin Australia check in, was so disorganised and long that made me appreciate Jetstar’s recent check in efficiency. To make matters worse, the staff at the lounge were so rude. I will think long and hard before I fly Virgin Australia next time. Very unhappy customer!

### "a pleasant flight"
Flew Melbourne to Gold Coast with Virgin Australia. There was a bit of a queue checking in but it was not too bad. There was also a slight delay in departure, but it arrived reasonably on time. The staff were very friendly and helpful, they were the best thing about the flight. It was nice to have complimentary drinks as well. The meal service was very small. Just a tiny savoury snack. Not really enough for what is supposed to be a full service airline. An early evening departure should include something more substantial. Overall a pleasant flight.

### "a problem free flight"
Melbourne to Canberra. Arrived at 05.30 from Bangkok via Brunei to transfer to a domestic flight. No problems with self check in and changing seats at the check in stage. Drop bags worked well with mine being slightly over the 23 kg limit  and was not asked to shift weight into my carry on bag (could easily have done so). One of the first to board - encouraged to go from the front rather than the rear stairs and concern when I stumbled going to my seat. Standard economy class seat which was perfectly adequate for a one hour flight. No IFE but that was expected on this short flight. Cabin attendants managed to deliver a snack and drink on the flight. They seemed quite happy with their tasks. Luggage was delivered shortly after landing. All in all a problem free flight which left and landed on time with luggage available soon after arrival. Canberra to Melbourne was the start of the outbound journey and a completely unexceptional journey. Plane landed about 10 minutes early and an identical report could be written about this earlier flight.

### "a wonderful flight"
Canberra to Adelaide on February 26, 2018. Unfortunately, the kiosks were unable to check anyone in who wasn’t travelling with carry-on only, but thankfully Canberra Airport hasn’t gone automated just yet, so there were team members on hand ready to help out. I was even offered an EconomyX seat for the early evening flight! A fairly small pax (only 58 passengers in economy), which meant snack service (in the middle of happy hour, which meant complimentary beer and wine) was even more efficient. Wonderful staff, and a wonderful flight with Virgin Australia.

### "an uneventful flight"
Sydney - Adelaide, 21 Feb. Boarding on this aircraft took some time because they invited people with needs to board first which was fine. Then they invited all their passengers with priority cards/membership etc which basically was about 60% of the passengers! The rest of us 'unworthy' people boarded last. The aircraft was clean but not new, inflight entertainment was via their app and seats were uncomfortable. Let room was cramped and seat width was small. The cabin attendants were friendly and proactive and they distributed a biscuit and a drink free of charge, unlike Qantas which gives out something more substantial. Overall an uneventful flight but on arrival, we were asked to walk down the rear aircraft stairs and join the aerobridge. Not so nice if you are carrying luggage.

### "excellent service"
Flew Virgin Australia from Sydney to Melbourne. The flight left early which was a nice surprise. The cabin crew were very friendly and efficient. IFE was only available via an app. The food (especially considering it was supposed to be dinner) was very limited. A very small packet of dry biscuits and juice or coffee. Not really good enough for a full service airline especially compared to Qantas. But the excellent service made it an enjoyable flight.

### "didn't offer a decent meal"
** EDITED - HAVE THEY SENT TICKET ??
The Virgin Australia flight from Melbourne to Sydney was unfortunately delayed. This is unfortunately a common occurrence on a Friday evening departure! The staff were very friendly and helpful. They were by far the best aspect of the flight. IFE even via the personal app was not operating. It's a pity for a full service airline they didn't offer a decent meal. Only a very small muffin. I did appreciate the free drinks.

### "are a horrible airline"
❎ Not Verified |  Melbourne to Sydney. The worst customer service I have experienced. Cancelled my Monday 10am flight, giving me an option to fly later at 11am and miss my meeting or earlier at 9am. Having no choice took the 9am. Tried to check in 24 hours before and each time they said you can check in at the airport only. Got to the airport early and tried to check in, again did not work and was told to go to the service desk. Queue for service desk was 40 minutes, when seen they said its 8.32 and we cant check you in. Despite explaining the situation they were unhelpful and scheduled me in for a 12pm flight, 3 hours later. Not only do they cancel flights at short notice, they dont allow you to check in, provide no access to lounge to accommodate their mess up, etc, they are a horrible airline that I will never fly with again.

### "have been treated disgracefully"
Perth to Sydney. My Samsonite suitcase was destroyed - these things are rock solid, to do the damage that incurred it would have to have been run over - and even them I would be amazed. The ground staff told me I couldn't claim and had to 'send a letter' however later I realised that I could contact them online and submit my complaint - That was 3 weeks ago and still nothing. Furthermore then made it as difficult as they could - I had to firstly seek out a JP (who said that the form they wanted signing by the JP wasn't even in a valid format and was purely to deter people from making a claim). We flew business class and have been treated disgracefully.

### "we missed our coach connection"
Flight VA908 6am cancelled, we were placed on VA912, Brisbane to Sydney, 6.35am flight. Given worst back of plane middle seats not together on this flight. Due to our original flight being cancelled we missed our coach connection to NSW south coast. There was no refund for the coach tickets. Needed to travel by train to south coast with additional costs for train fares. We had heavy luggage to carry around with long waits for connecting trains. We are Virgin Velocity members. Not happy.

### "arrived to a 4.5 hour delay"
Perth to Port Hedland. I arrived at the airport this morning to a 4.5 hour delay, there was no text message advising me of the delay which would have allowed me to stay at home. There was also no food offered when I went to the service desk despite the Virgin website stating "You will be entitled to refreshment vouchers at 2-hour intervals while you are in the airport awaiting your delayed service". I fly regularly and hold platinum status with other airlines. Each time I fly Virgin I am reminded why they're my last choice in travel (My most recent Virgin flight before this one also included a 3.5 hour delay). They are incomparable to their competitors when it comes to quality of service, the Virgin app is near unusable, and staff seem disinterested in looking after their customers.

### "do not guarantee seating"
Sydney to Gold Coast./ I always fly with Virgin as I thought they were better and I was happy to pay more for a better service. Last time I was separated from my partner, and although flight centre assured us we were sitting together, and despite receiving a last minute reminder of my seat number from Virgin, when we got to the check in desk the hostess didn’t even tell us we weren’t sitting together until we asked her. As I complained via email I was told twice : Please be advised, you did not book a paid seat i.e. economy X seat or exit row seat. As mentioned in my previous email, Virgin Australia do not guarantee seating due to multiple reasons. So I basically ended up paying more to be sure to come back on the same flight and sit close to each other, to end up alone.

### "Get to Bali no luggage"
Auckland to Bali via Brisbane. Changed planes in Brisbane, luggage loaded on saw luggage taken off, asked hostess why she said she had no idea asked her to find out she walked away with her nose in the air after embarrassing me in front of passengers. Get to Bali no luggage, no sorry, no explanation, luggage turns up almost 48 hrs later - still no sorry no explanation after repeatedly contacting them over 2 wks. I get offered $50 that is not going to make up for the distress myself partner and daughter endured over our lost luggage.

### "an enjoyable flight"
I enjoyed my flight with Virgin Australia. Friendly and easy check in. The flight attendants were very friendly and helpful. The meal that was served was very tasty with delicious wine, perhaps there could have been more choice though. Also there was no IFE offered unless passengers used wifi. Overall an enjoyable flight.

### "the plane left with our seats empty"
Denver to Sydney via Melbourne. Never, will I fly this airline again! They could not have messed our travel up more if they had tried in both directions. They had cancelled our outbound flight without our knowledge and it was not until we were doing our online check-in did we notice that they changed our flight from 9:00PM to 9:00AM the next morning. They literally wanted us to fly into LA only to sleep on the floor of an airport without our knowledge, which was not possible as my spouse had recently had back surgery. We were also meeting someone in Sydney who would have had to wait it out there for 12+ hours. Were able to get them to book us on another flight out earlier the same evening as our original flight, however, we could no longer use the upgraded seats that we had paid for and they had a difficult time getting our boarding passes cleared for the international flight from LA to Melbourne. It took them 50+ minutes on the phone with their own customer service and luckily someone at the gate that understood booking to work it out. We had to add an additional leg by flying into Melbourne and the connection they gave us was much too tight and we missed that flight as well. Fortunately we could catch the next flight out not long after. Our return trip was the most arduous journey we have ever had to endure! We were to fly home via their partner airline, Delta. With our boarding passes in hand, enduring the suffering of getting thru security and waiting hours to board, we were not allowed on the airplane at the very last minute because Virgin refused to give control of our ticket to Delta. So the plane left with our seats empty that we had purchased 7 months prior to this trip! They escorted us out and told us there was nothing either airline could do and that we would have to purchase new tickets to get home! So at an additional cost of $4600.00 for new tickets from a third airline with the lovely SSSS code attached to them due to the purchase being so close to the flight, having to go thru security again, we were now treated like criminals while enduring escalated security!

### "with great empathy rebooked my family"
We had a family emergency during our holiday that led us to have to cut our holiday short by a week. After explaining the situation to a staff member at the Virgin Australia flight desk, she without pause and with great empathy rebooked my family and I for the next available flight. This is in spite of the booking having being made through Expedia. The flight that followed was without note, except for a faulty media system - but the service and empathy of their staff of the cannot be questioned. Thank you.

### "flight service was excellent"
Flew Sydney to Perth on a Virgin Australia Airbus A330-200. On arrival to the airport, check-in queue was short with friendly staff at the counter. Got to the gate (which was on the other side of the airport) and was told that I was moved from my previously checked in seat. Still had a window seat and the situation was kindly explained by ground staff. Unfortunately there was a 20 minute delay because of a cargo fault and the captain explained the issue to the cabin promptly. The flight service was excellent and the food was adequate. Would recommend this airline and plane again.

### "impressed with the staff"
Gold Coast to Albury via Sydney. Really impressed with the staff and airline. We had an incident which caused us to be late and miss our flight home. The Virgin Australia staff were very calming and offered us an immediate solution! Super happy and thankful! I am definitely happy we chose to fly with Virgin Australia.

### "both bad experiences"
Sydney to Melbourne. Twice flown, both bad experiences. Appalling check in (understaffed), oldish planes, generally a worse than Ryanair experience, which is not a great accolade. One particularly rude check-in staff member pushed me to leave this review today. I will look for a different domestic airline from now as it couldn’t be any worse! Virgin Australia is another world from Virgin Atlantic.

### "you get what you pay for"
Melbourne to Brisbane. Flight left and arrived on time, however the good news ends there. The plane was old and is in dire need of a refresh. A sickly sweet rocky road Byron Bay cookie was handed out that I was not able to stomach. I purchased a sandwich which was $9 alone even though they are $5 in 7/11 and very dry. To top it all off one of the flight attendants spilt someone's remaining water down my back as they were clearing the row behind me. They had a good giggle over it, said they were just trying to cool me down and moved on. I would say you get what you pay for but really the prices for Virgin are up there with Qantas at the moment, especially after you buy a $9 sandwich.

### "Service was attentive"
Sydney to Hobart. What a fantastic flight! Sparkling wine offered upon boarding, with a refill. Excellent food, free flowing drinks and the best cabin crew I've encountered for a very long time. Service was attentive without being obtrusive, warm and friendly. Left and arrived on time, plane spotless and the food was great.

### "We have to throw stuff out"
Adelaide to Brisbane. We had a flight book for 10 people through flight center but virgin charge 3 different prices so we end up with 3 different bookings. At the check in counter in Adelaide airport we were told that we all have to checkin at seperate counter so we check in one booking at the time and let other people pass on to available counter. We just want to check in with the same person so we can all seat near each others. Certainly upset the staff at the counter and the whole service after that was a rough one. Our combined bags were way under, we even have one checkin bags weight 3 kg for 23 kg allowance. Only one bag 26 kg and to get it in we need to pay $70 extra. We have to throw stuff out at the airport and see the people at the x-ray gate collecting it.

### "never had such poor service"
Flew Virgin Australia from Canberra to Sydney. Arrived at airport 15 mins before check-in closed. 5.15am. Kiosks had already closed so had to go to the counter. I had no luggage. Business trip. While waiting another passenger pushed in and was served. When I got to the counter I was told they had over booked. Last ticket was given to the queue jumper! I had to catch the next flight an hour later - 7am. No apology. Made to wait, hungry and cold in departure lounge for over an hour. Missed my first meeting in Sydney. Have travelled for 20 years and never had such poor service. I will never fly Virgin again. Disgusting customer service and no accountability. Lucky to given them even one star.

### "could not take frozen goods to HKG
I am extremely disappointed in Virgin Australia. The check in service was extremely disappointing and the main issue of this complaint and cause of why I am unlikely to fly Virgin Australia in the future and do not recommend Virgin Australia. When checking in, I was asked about the contents of my luggage. I disclosed that I was taking some frozen food (meat and fish) from MEL to HKG which I regularly have been for years on other airlines. The food was vacuum sealed, frozen and packed into a freezer satchel. I fly between HKG and MEL usually twice per month or more and have had no issue with doing so. I was told that the check in representative needed to check about my baggage which was a surprise. After some time, I was told that I could not take the frozen goods to HKG. I had driven to the airport and park in the Long Term car park so there was not someone at the airport with me whom would be able to take them back for me. It was suggested that I leave it in my car (for 10 days while I travelled). The expensive contents (costing a significant portion of the flight cost) would perish in that time. There was little concern for my goods nor my situation. I was offered to be removed from the flight and travel the next day, which was not an option as I need to be in HKG that evening for an event. I had chosen the VA87 flight as the arrival time suited me and enable me to attend the event. Second, I was upset about the situation and then was further annoyed when I was told that I should have read all of the terms of carriage. I have since checked the information provided on baggage and have not found information readily available relating to not being able to check in frozen goods to take from MEL to HKG. There is one section under the "Conditions of Carriage" page that I had to dig to find that referred to seafood, however this was in references to the "Limitation of Liability" of Virgin (refer clause 19.5(a)(iv)). This does not relate to preventing or prohibiting the checking in of frozen goods. I think that it was unreasonable for my baggage to be refused. Third, then separately, when waiting at the gate to board, an announcement was made (well after the scheduled boarding time) that the boarding time (originally 10:15 am) and departure time (originally 11:00 am) would be delayed. The passengers were loaded onto the plane and then while on the plane, further delays were announced leading to the passengers being requested to disembark after 12:00 noon. We were told that the delays were due to engineering requirements, however we were later advised the original delay was due to the delay of the income plane. The further delays were due to engineering attending to something on the plane. The staff on the plane were very good about managing the passengers and the delay. We eventually arrived into very late HKG to which I missed the event I needed to attend. Post flight, the Virgin Australia Customer Service, an automated impersonal email based mechanism has been atrocious. Do not fly Virgin Australia overseas.

### "snack and drinks were served several times"
Sydney to Ayers Rock. The crew was friendly and helpful. Pleasing was the spending of a small snack and drinks were served several times and in sufficient quantity. Unfortunately, the ground staff cannot keep this standard. My frequent flyer number was not accepted into my booking, though. The flight was still about 1 hour late

### "crew was friendly and helpful"
Sydney to Apia. The crew was friendly and helpful. The aircraft made a newer impression. We had booked an emergency exit as a seat (13C) and the seat pitch was very pleasant. Unfortunately, the backrest can not be adjusted in this row of seats. It would have been possible in row 14. There was only drinks and no snacks on this night flight. Also, the air conditioning was set too cool and blankets were not available.

### "They should be held accountable"
Auckland to Sydney. The aircraft had a technical problem on the way to Auckland 5 days ago, causing a delay of over 4 hours. We handed up arriving after 5 pm and not being able to collect the Campervans we had prepaid for. Today, from Auckland to Sydney, the flight was delayed by 45 minutes. But once on the plane, we experience technical issues once again. After our of wait, they made us offload the plane and going back to the gate. At the gate no one gave us instructions on what to expect next. After a couple of hours and lots of waiting around, we manage to find out which flight and gate we had to go to. We arrived in Sydney with several hours of delay, no apologies, no compensation not even a voucher for buying some food in the whole day we spent at the airport waiting around. They wasted 2 of the 6 days of our holidays, making it not worthwhile having the break. They should be held accountable and offer a compensation. On top of everything else, the aircraft was more similar to a bus, with no room for legs or arms. Very uncomfortable.

### " crew were flawless"
Adelaide to Perth via Sydney, starting with VA401, the scheduled 6am service to Sydney. Flight was on one of the more modern Boeing 737-800's of the fleet. A snack and beverages were provided on this flight, and overall, it was a good flight. The next leg, VA555 to PER was exceptional in every way! The A330 is certainly the only way to do a transcontinental flight, with unsurpassed comfort in economy and seatback entertainment screens. A full hot meal was served on this flight, and the flight attendants were all fantastic. The following evening, it was VA696 from Perth to Melbourne, the scheduled 22:35 service. To my surprise, the crew (once again warm, friendly and attentive) served us a hot supper before dimming the lights, ahead of a 5am landing in Melbourne. Finally, VA444 on November 28, the scheduled 20:15 service from Sydney to Adelaide. Once again, the crew were flawless on this flight, and a light snack was served along with drinks. Overall, Virgin Australia is certainly becoming a fierce competitor to Qantas, and they clearly mean business when it comes to service!

### "I’ll never fly Virgin again"
Sydney to Auckland. The surprise we had at th airport just wrecked our day. I purchased the flight several week in advance directly on Virgin website. Closer to the flight I was emailed the itinerary and I realised the flight was going to be provided by Air New Zealand rather than Virgin. I no problem with that, but when I tried to proceed with online check in I wasn’t able to complete it because I had a Virgin booking number and not a AirNZ one. This meant not being able to check luggage allowance and seats. At the airport we were surprisingly charged with $140 luggage excess for trying and check in 10kg when Virgin allows 24 kg in international flights in economy class. Not having a chiuse we paid AirNZ and were redirected to Virgin to pre purchase a luggage for the return flight. Virgin refused to allow prepurchase forcing us to pay $140 excess on the way back. I would have never taken $10kg to check in for $280. I could have easily fit everything in the carry on like I usually do. After a massive argument Virgin went from ‘there nothing we can do’ to ‘we can charge you $25 for the luggage on the return flight’. It’s a shame it coasted me $140 + $25 and ruined the mood for the rest of the day. Very poor service. The e-ticket should have been clear and I should have been allowed to online check in. On top of it I couldn’t choose my seats upfront and even asking for a sole seat I got given a middle seat. I am claustrophobic and I almost felt like barring off the holiday and going back home and the pint. I’ll never fly Virgin again.

### "Its cheaper for a reason"
Flew Perth to Kalgoorlie with Virgin Australia. This airline is unbelievably terrible. I fly to work every week with Qantas and every now and again I get put on Virgin because it is cheaper. Its cheaper for a reason. Theres always something wrong (delayed, issue with the plane, not enough people booked so they just cancel at the last minute etc). The the last time they cancelled my 7am flight (to work) and rebooked it at 4pm. I wasn't told this until 9pm the night before. So I missed an entire day of work with no explanation or compensation - a day I would have to make up on my weekend. Their boarding pass to text is also useless. It takes 10 min to load and they dont give you a coupon at the gate so if you (or the flight attendant) accidentally closes the text while scanning you have to wait until everyone else has boarded and then get your ID out to be given a boarding pass! Never again.

### "this flight was pretty faultless"
Flew Sydney to Hobart via Melbourne. I've traveled many times with Virgin Australia over the last few years and once again, this flight was pretty faultless. The check-in was relatively fast and very friendly. Flights left on time, the aircraft was clean, the crew were all excellent, the seats were comfortable, the free tea/coffee and snack were welcome - although the snack needs a review. Usually the food is appropriate but nearly always incredibly small - after all, this company made a huge deal about adding food and baggage allowance for it's economy customers. However, as these are short flights about 1hr 20mins each, not such a big deal. The whole flight process is pretty slick and very well-managed. I really like VA and believe they are certainly better than Qantas within Australia. I do find their IFE requirement for an app a nuisance.

### "leg space was not generous"
Auckland to Sydney. Uneventful trans-Tasman flight with Virgin Australia. The flight was smooth and on time, the cabin crew friendly. The leg space was not generous, but sufficient for a three-and-a-half hours flight. I deliberately chose a fare that did not include a bag or food. But at least, I could choose my own seat at check-in, which is not the case with similar fares of some trans-Tasman competitors.

### "no meal available"
Melbourne to Sydney. I enjoyed the flight. Friendly staff, free alcohol and easy check in. The flight departed on time. I was disappointed that in a flight departing in the early evening there was no meal available. Just a very small package of dry biscuits. The food to purchase was limited as well (mainly nuts and chips). IFE can only be accessed via an app. QANTAS is far more generous. But the staff were very good .

### "delay of nearly two hours"
Brisbane to Melbourne. Because of a computer fault with bookings there was a delay of nearly two hours which was most inconvenient. I hope something is done to make sure nothing like this happens in the future. It is odd that in what is supposed to be a full service airline there is very little on flight food available, especially compared to QANTAS. An evening flight should have a decent meal on a flight that is over two hours. The food available to purchase is not very impressive either (mainly nuts and chips) . Although it's possible to download IFE via an app, there should be on on board IFE available as well. On the plus side, the FA were very efficient and polite.

### "staff made it a pleasant flight"
Sydney to Melbourne. Check in was very busy and crowded at Sydney Airport. The staff were very pleasant and efficient. The flight left on time. The let down is the food. For a full service airline leaving at dinner time they should have provided more then a small package of cheese and biscuits. Food to purchase does not amount to much either and IFE can only be accessed via an app. But the staff made it a pleasant flight.

### "flights are consistently late"
Melbourne to Sydney. Have been a flyer with Virgin Australia for a year now - the flights are consistently late, The planes are old and dirty, seats are uncomfortable and the food is complete embarrassment. Staff are great and super friendly.

### "Virgin Australia are all front"
Townsville to Sydney. Premium lite. Despite having an extra baggage allowance couldn't bundle bags even though the 32kg limit per bag wasn't breached. Had to cross load a 25kg bag to a 20kg bag to satisfy them and only 23kg bags policy. Jetstar don't even do that. Onboard "refreshments" - pathetic for a full cost carrier would be an understatement. Lunch was a 2 fishfinger sized pieces of bread with egg salad on. No soft drinks only juice or tea/coffee. The whole cabin service is nudged to the menu where you have to purchase. Flight crew need to drop the hip attempt at being funny. I cringed at it. Still poorly executed. Fly Jetstar or Tiger if you want to save money, Virgin Australia are all front.

### "young but experienced crew"
Apia to Auckland. Late evening flight by Virgin Australia (for Virgin Samoa) with one hour delay, which was not announced at Faleolo Airport in Samoa. As we boarded the aircraft the friendly and efficient crew informed us about the delay. The seats were quite comfortable for a short nap, food was served quickly after take off and the drinks were served throughout the flight. There was a drunken passenger on board in business class, no problem for the crew, they handled the incident professionally: The passenger got his Coke and "Jim Beam with Coke" more and more in big quantities of Coke without J.B. Congratulations to the very young but experienced crew which showed a masterclass of treating your client without offending him.

### "young, friendly and efficient"
Auckland to Samoa. Smooth travel with friendly crew. The crew on this flight was young, friendly and efficient. The food choice is rather limited but just ok for this 4 hour flight. The seats are comfortable, although not much recline options. My Bags had a priority Sticker and they arrived - as always - first on the carousel (even in Samoa). And with VA one can check through bags from Europe in New Zealand tries checks through bags from Europe on most carriers in New Zealand to Samoa. The Samoan Government wants to create its own airline and will finish the cooperation with Virgin Australia in November this year. I have enjoyed Virgin Australia flights over more then 10 years from New Zealand and Australia to Samoa and vice versa. VA had a very good track record with affordable prices in all classes, they were punctual and had a very good product in business class. The new Samoa Airways will have to work hard to get it right.

### "never fly Virgin Australia again"
Sydney to Nadi. Virgin Australia left us stranded at Sydney airport when they decided to cancel our flight. Left waiting at one terminal, then sent to another, then flight cancelled. The reason was eventually explained as "crew". Completely ruined booked holiday to a resort for 5 days. Offered no compensation. Told could fly next day despite having several flights a day to Nadi. Staff seemingly concerned any yet unable to help in any way. Just following company policy". Out of pocket for holiday booked. Taxi expenses etc. This cancelation was totally of Virgin incompetency "crew problem". Will never fly Virgin Australia again. Recommend not to.

### "a very good experience"
Brisbane to Los Angeles. First flight with Virgin Australia, and it was a very good experience. The airplane was new B777 with a 3x3x3 seat arrangement in Economy and an appealing design of the cabin interior. The seat pitch was adequate and the service was excellent. VA provided all passengers with a small amenity kit and a bottle of water. There was a choice of three meals for lunch, including one vegetarian option. I had chick pea curry with rice, rice crackers, naan bread and a brownie, all of which was very tasty. Furthermore, we were served a snack in mid-flight and a breakfast before landing. Overall, the quality of the food was clearly above average for economy class .

### "Boarding efficiency was amazing"
Flew Virgin Australia from Melbourne to Auckland. Beautifully smooth flying until touch down. Great pilots! Landing rough due to winds, aircraft circled for a while before finally going below clouds. Still arrived early ahead of schedule. Boarding efficiency was amazing considering how full the plane was. Disembarking was shockingly slow though. The age of plane, uncomfortable headrests, unclean seat pockets, very slow food service, awful qualities of complimentary drinks were the let downs. Otherwise the above positives added with courteous crew services made this flight good.

### "A very routine flight"
Sydney to Melbourne with Virgin Australia. Despite gloomy weather, the flight departed on time. A very routine flight, but I found the cabin crew were much more enthusiastic and customer focused than my previous flights. The hard product was okay, uncomfortable as always. Virgin really do need to upgrade their planes and as for the IFE, an update is needed with more content.

### "inflight app a great innovation"
Sydney to Melbourne. I chose Virgin because my friend recommended it. In Sydney Airport, the check in staff were great and friendly, even ignored my slightly overweight suitcase with a smile. Boarding was slow but still OK. Landing and takeoff were smooth. During the flight FA distributed snacks and a choice of beverages was available. There was no IFE but WiFi was available and the inflight app was a great innovation.

### "not been able to fit my legs behind the seat"
I have been a travelling salesman for most of my adult life and flown hundreds of times domestically and internationally during my life. I have never in that time boarded a plane and not been able to fit my legs in behind the seat in front of me until I boarded this Virgin Australia plane to Brisbane to Bali. Nor have I been talked down to like a child by cabin crew. On this flight one of the cabin crew was great and empathized with my obvious difficulty. The other two couldn't care less. One berated me with the company policy on seating for take off and forced me to sit with my legs off the floor, jammed into the seat in front of me as this was the only way I could get my legs in. After take off the other cabin crew rammed my left leg with the food trolley and acted oblivious to my pain. I found this demeaning and totally unacceptable. The staff member with empathy moved me up into an economy X seat which is what I consider normal economy seating on an international flight. God help them if a basketball, netball or rugby team books a flight to Bali on this plane. They don't have enough economy X seats to move them to.

### "no food nor even snacks"
Denpasar to Brisbane. Unbelievable that on more than 5-hours flight they provide you only coffee, tea or water and no food nor even snacks! If you want anything, you need to pay extra. Additionally, before boarding plane in Denpasar they will take away from you the water bottle, leaving you thirsty and dependent on flight attendants, who look that they do not even care. The seats are perfect for the person same height as me, 167cm. My partner who is 177cm had already problems to fit in. No IFE, only if you have an app and still you need to hold your phone all the time. This is ridiculous comparing the ticket prices for the same route with other airlines or European standards. Next time to Bali only with Malindo Air.

### "no inflight entertainment"
I've flown Virgin Australia many times between Sydney and Perth. Today I was most disappointed with no inflight entertainment for a 5 hour flight. If there was a heads up on this I could have got my Ipad from my checked in bag. Lots of people were annoyed.

### "A very average service by Virgin"
Gold Coast to Sydney. A very average service by Virgin, quite limited team members available at the airport with only one person scanning boarding pass during boarding. Once onboard, the flight departed on time and the cabin crew were more engaging than my previous flights. I tried to distract myself with the inflight entertainment by not focusing on how uncomfortable their seat was. Even though it's economy, there are standards to up hold. Would I fly with Virgin again? Yes, when I really need to.

### "Virgin needs to not offer food"
Sydney to Brisbane. Flight was delayed by 25 minutes without any notification, which is not appropriate. All schedule change needs to be communicated, no matter how small. Luckily the flight was just over an hour long, considering economy class in their planes can be quite unbearable. Like I have mentioned in my previous reviews, Virgin needs to not offer food or have a better offering because a muesli bar is not adequate and the plane needs an upgrade to having screens on seats for better use of IFE. Lastly, Virgin only seems to be good at getting you from A to B.

### "plane was not very clean"
Denpasar to Brisbane. Check in took forever despite me having checked in online already. The staff was confused with our baby passport for some mysterious reason. Cabin crew rude and did not care about our baby or my wife being anxious about turbulence. There was no food included for a 5.5 hour flight, I have never seen this before. The plane was not very clean, especially food trays

### "check in was quick and easy"
Canberra to Melbourne. The check in was quick and easy. The flight from Canberra departed and arrived a little early, the flight from Melbourne was delayed by almost 30 minutes due to fog in Canberra and was amalgamated with an earlier (also delayed flight) Fog is beyond the airline control. I received timely announcement of the delay and the reason for it. The flight was late landing but some time had been made up on this short sector. Both flights were uneventful. A light snack was served in both directions. Cabin crew were friendly but on the Melbourne to Canberra sector were very busy.

### "Seats were terribly narrow"
Sydney to Melbourne. I called customer service for a window seat and they said there were only aisle seats - yet immediately after the call finished I logged in and found most of the window row seats were available. The self-check in machines at the airport are very short and check in staff were not very welcoming. There was no greeter for the lounge either despite their being 4 staffers looking bored behind 2 desks. The lounge was busy, messy and there was no coat service or bag depository at reception. Seats onboard were terribly narrow. I got one drink but despite asking the stewardess they put no ice in it. Even though my bag clearly had MEL on the tag they sent it to Brisbane by mistake. They were late to deliver it the next day. Over 10 days later there was no follow up apology.

### "confirmed means something else to Virgin Australia"
The Virgin Australia website was acting up for 3 weeks and not letting me retrieve my booking from Melbourne to Gold Coast. Each time I called them about this they had different excuses and tried to blame the problem on me. I eventually got them to manually send me my itinerary through email - only to be told that I would have to pay extra at the gate since apparently the seat I originally chose was an Economy X seat. This was even after they sent me a confirmed itinerary. Apparently the word confirmed means something else to Virgin Australia. Even if you have a confirmed seat, you still might be made to pay more at the gate.

### "attention to detail is sublime"
I flew "Business" from Sydney to Perth and back. I have always thought Etihad had one of the best Business Class products but wow - Virgin Australia blew me away. The service and attention to detail is sublime. The food was just amazing for a domestic carrier anywhere in the world, just like the seat and service. Undoubtedly one of the best in the world.

### "VA do have the superior product"
Brisbane to Los Angeles. First time with Virgin Australia and travelled in their business suite. Check in at Brisbane was a breeze with the kiosks and drop off. My only criticism is that with the bag drop there wasn't a staff member actually allocated there to assist passengers. They kind of roam around between different areas. Therefore when I had an issue I had to signal for one to come and help. Also when that was done they didn't volunteer information about what lounge I am entitled to use. I believe there is a business class check in counter, but I didn't see this as wasn't looking. So just a bit more of a personal touch point would be nice. Seat - So much room, felt like a nice comfy chair and couldn't complain about this at all. Having flown Air NZ and QF, I believe VA do have the superior product. But just a bit over NZ and hugely over QF. Food service was good and quality was enjoyable. I would have appreciated being offered another bread roll with dinner before that was taken away. One thing that was odd is that the blankets were not on the seats. You had to ask for them. Thought that this could have been on the seat ready for you like the other carriers do. My FA was great at acknowledging all of us passengers and ensured that we were fully aware of the seat and layout of the cabin. Toilet/bar etc. The flight went really fast and was very impressed overall.

### "Outstanding service"
Sydney to Perth. Flight 555 15th May. We were delayed due to weather in Melbourne and arrived late due to rain and wind in Perth. Fully informed by the Captain. We have never seen such professional and helpful staff. The service was great and all staff were full of smiles. We were unaware that all food and beverage were included, so a nice surprise. Outstanding service. Thanks Virgin

### "Worst experience with Virgin Australia"
Sydney to Melbourne. Notified by text message around 2pm that the 7:30pm flight is delayed to 8:30pm. Got to airport and surprised by changing the time to 22:00 instead of 20:30 without any notifications. I explained to the counter when receiving the boarding pass that I need to be at work tonight in the hospital and how she can help me with this problem; she offered an earlier flight at 21:10 which i gratfully agreed. When reached to the Gate realized the number on the boarding pass is incorrect, found the right gate and notified there is more delay and the flight is going be at 21:15, I asked for the reason and been told that Virgin has crew issues! We flew eventually at 21:45 and had the worse seat at the end of the aircraft No. 30. Worst experience with Virgin Australia ever.

### "no TV screen on board"
Check-in at Brisbane Airport is easy using the kiosk machine. I simply swiped my Velocity Frequent Flyer Card and it has all my information ready. However passengers are still required to queue up to drop-in luggage. Virgin Australia could have adopted what Perth Airport has, individual / computerised bag drop to reduce waiting/queuing time. The Boeing 737-800 do not come with USB port to charge devices. There is no TV screen on board so passengers need to download the app prior to boarding and they can stream movies, music across the WiFi on board. Voyeur magazine is packed with interesting travel stories and articles which is worthwhile reading to kill some time with music on your iPod. For dinner we were offered a choice of nasi goreng or beef rogan with passengers' choice of beverage and dessert. I must say I am disappointed with the food. I chose the beef and upon opening the box it was just steamed jasmine rice with beef rogan and no vegetables or anything. Beef is well cooked. Cabin crew is friendly and constantly goes around with water to keep everyone hydrated.

### "crew friendly and helpful"
Check-in at Perth Virgin Domestic Terminal was easy and straightforward. I simply swiped my Velocity Frequent Flyer card at the Kiosk, followed some steps and checked in my luggage. The aircraft (Boeing 737-800) does not have any USB port for charging devices for a over 4 hours flight to Brisbane which is a great inconvenient. There are no screens for passengers to access the entertainment system and passengers need to download an app to stream movie, music over onboard WiFi. I hesitated to do it because I do not want to drain the battery on my iPad and iPhone. For breakfast there was only one option which is scrambled eggs with hashbrown, mango yoghurt and choice of beverages. I am fine with vegetarian option for breakfast but I would appreciate having the option to choose. The crew went around for 2 rounds of drinks throughout the flight. Generally the crew is friendly and helpful. Seats are comfortable. I was seated on the first row of economy class with extra leg room. This has definitely made the leather seat even more comfortable.

### "horrendous experience"
Horrendous experience flying from Melbourne to Gold Coast, Virgin Australia cram 3 rows of Business Class and 27 rows of Economy Class into each 737-800, if you are in Economy there is no legroom. It is so bad my knees were near my chin, it took my three days to recover from the pain from this flight, no inflight entertainment, meal was a tiny cookie and a cup of stale orange juice, yuck.

### "all very well organized"
Sydney to Melbourne is a rather short flight so economy is fine. I booked the day before  with Virgin Australia so was more expensive than normal. Aisle seat in row 4 with middle seat open. Left a few minutes late, arrived a few early, and uneventful. All very well organized, boarding, cabin service, equipment, all well oiled machine. Cabin crew very quick, efficient still friendly. Amazes me how you can keep smiling non stop at all this strangers. Coffee surprisingly good. Lunch was egg sandwich, interestingly packed, quite tasty. I read newspaper and did some work, so did not use entertainment at all.

### "very attentive FAs"
I had a short notice business trip Melbourne to Sydney booked just the day before, so ended up in a middle seat on the 7 am. In the lounge I asked if an aisle seat had opened up. The friendly agent responded it's a very busy flight, but my fare qualified for an upgrade with one of my platinum vouchers. I would normally not use them on a short flight, but I really dislike middle seats, and she had such a nice smile at 6.10 am, so I took it. Perfect trip, very attentive FAs, surprisingly good coffee. After 10 years in US, Virgin Australia is just such a nice difference.

### "737's are crammed full"
Gold Coast to Melbourne. Virgin are stacking in the passengers at the expense of comfort, these 737's are crammed full, no leg room, my knees were in the seat in front of me. No satellite tv service any more which is ridiculous. They used to offer free Foxtel but now have some streaming service where you need to bring your own device, too bad if you don't have one! Flight included a free snack - a tiny biscuit and a cup of long life juice, I cannot believe they seriously think this passes as a snack, even a can of Coca Cola is charged. Virgin Australia is a joke if they think they are a full service airline.

### "I do miss back of seat entertainment"
Townsville to Melbourne via Brisbane with Virgin Australia. Good points were the aircraft left on time both times, arriving on time, The seats were good and comfortable and as we had downloaded the entertainment app, we had access to quite a few movies and TV shows on our own devices. It does cause neck pain after a while looking down all the time, I do miss the back of seat entertainment a lot. The biggest negative was the "snack", the same on both legs. A 29g chocolate bar and drink. Almost an insult. They had a price list in the seat pocket of food to purchase but I guess it didn't apply to either flights. Come on, this is supposed to be a "full service outline". However we arrived safely and the comfort of the seats were better than Jetstar on the way up.

### "customer service was excellent"
We were stranded on the Gold Coast hinterland following severe flooding that caused the road to be washed away. Despite Virgin having to cancel all their flights from Coolangatta for 24 hours and having a call centre close due to flooding, their customer service was excellent. Out situation weas changing from hour to hour, and Virgin changed our flights 3 times without any hassle, even though we had cheap tickets that were not flexible. Would recommend to anyone looking for a reliable domestic airline in Australia.

### "worst example of airline food"
Brisbane to Wellington with Virgin Australia. This has to be the worst example of airline food I have experienced in 20 years. Why bother. To make it worse, on the return leg they completely forgot to even provide the meal which I had paid for and I did have to remind them to serve a beverage of my choice. The service on the US airlines is better, and that is saying something! Ground service in Wellington also pathetic and disinterested. Air NZ or Qantas anyday.

### "reasonably priced service"
Gladstone to Brisbane. The ground staff and cabin crew were friendly. The aircraft was not a new one, but in a decent condition. The in-flight virgin magazine contained some interesting essays. In addition, the coffee they served in this early morning flight was tasty. The flight was a very short one, so many important factors may not be assessed. However, it was a relatively satisfying and reasonably priced service.

### "the worst I've experienced"
Adelaide to Canberra via Melbourne. I have been flying with various airlines frequently, particularly in the last 2 years, however, I will have to say that my recent experience with Virgin Australia has been the worst I've experienced, apart from the final flight back from Sydney to Adelaide. On arrival to Canberra Airport, via Melbourne from Adelaide, I waited at the baggage carousel for 45 minutes until a passenger saw me still standing there alone and came to inform me that the luggage belonging to 6 passengers, including myself was in Melbourne. I was thankful that a van later delivered it to my lodgings 5 hours later, however annoyed that Virgin Australia had not informed any of the passengers themselves earlier. On my return flight, there were other issues with what looked like a very outdated plane which has communication problems causing us to have to disembark before take off and re enter the terminal before embarking another plane. I also noticed the young air hostesses did not look very happy as people in that role usually do which did not help to ease the tension, unlike the amazing airline staff from Sydney to Adelaide who seemed to have an excellent camaraderie amongst them.

### "everything so robotic"
Brisbane to Sydney with Virgin Australia. The one thing Virgin is good at is getting you to your destination on time, it stops after that. I find everything so robotic with no sense of customer interaction. I can understand keeping to schedule with task and routine but please be more lively. I know the flight is only just over an hour but in regards to the food being offered, you might as well not serve anything at all because the portion is so small. Compare to Qantas, Virgin needs to do some homework in this department. Lastly, the aircraft is looking very dated and really needs a refurbishment, they could possibly do with brand new aircrafts. Seats don't even have entertainment screen, it's really a must these days considering how much people travel on the east coast of Australia. They do offer the option of downloading their app to view entertainment via your own device but honestly that's not good enough. I will only be flying Virgin if I have to or if they have a better product.

### "choose a different airline"
Brisbane to Perth. Never again, better to pay a bit more with a different airline then to go with Virgin ever again. If you want to come to the airport for a domestic flight, 3 hours prior to the flight, then be told not to go to the gate before 30 min to the flight, and eventually 25 minutes before flight been refused entry to the aircraft then choose Virgin Australia. My wife was the passenger and If I was not with her at the airport I would not believe the whole story. So my wife was refused to enter the aircraft 5:10 pm for a 5:30 flight. Before that we were told not to go to the gate before 5 pm. We came to the airport 2:30. And while arguing with the flight attendant the gate was open, and my wife was watching when her bag was taken off the airplane. Next time I definitely choose a different airline. I did travel with Virgin before, but never again.

### "a very enjoyable flight"
Melbourne to Gold Coast with Virgin Australia. A pleasant flight. Check in via the kiosk at the airport was fine. The plane left on time and the service was very friendly. I also appreciated the free drinks. It's a pity that IFE, unlike Qantas was only available via downloading on the mobile phone. Also although the flight left at 18.50 the only free food was a very small packet of nuts and crackers. The food available to purchase was limited as well. Not really good enough for a full service airline. But the excellent service made it a very enjoyable flight.

### "food offer was incredibly sad"
Sydney to Brisbane. My first leg of a Japan Holiday and flew in economy as the flight is about an hour long. It's been a while since I have flown with Virgin, and it hasn't really changed, literally just going through the motions. The plane is definitely looking dated and needs an upgrade and was quite noisy. Flight was on time which is very important to me and as for the inflight product, not much on offer in terms of entertainment and food offer was incredibly sad. Never brand yourself as a premium or full service carrier if you need to charge for most things, very petty.

### "Appalling customer service"
Sydney to Melbourne. Appalling customer service. Flight cancelled with no reason provided, and rebooked for considerably later in day. I realise cancellations happen, but the subsequent service was terrible. Initial discussion with contact centre was unhelpful. They were unwilling to escalate the problem to someone who could fix the problem. I was misled regarding seat availability on earlier flights than the one I had been rebooked on. Only after I publically complained on social media was I directed to someone who could solve problem (they magically found a seat on a flight that apparently had none), but it was too little too late.

### "flights were on time"
Melbourne to Adelaide (return) with Virgin Australia. FAs were polite and flights were on time. Complimentary snacks in the form of biscuits were served during the flight alongside tea/coffee/juice which I felt was more that adequate for such a short flight. IFE, in the form of in flight wi-fi streaming direct to your mobile, worked perfectly and there was a wide range of new blockbuster movies to choose from. Being able to access the VA lounge through my Velocity membership was an added bonus.

### "not much better than a low cost carrier"
I booked the 14.25 flight from Sydney to Canberra and built plans around it, including flying into Sydney earlier in the day to get that flight and arranging to attend a function upon arrival in Canberra. I was very annoyed to receive a text on the morning of the flight to advise that it had been cancelled - no explanation. I was put on the next available flight at 17.05, which meant I had to sit in the terminal for over 4 hours waiting and my arrival plans for Canberra had been totally disrupted. As the new departure time finally approached we were informed that this flight had been delayed 20 minutes, further disrupting my arrival plans in Canberra. Virgin Australia promotes itself as an alternative to Qantas but there are too many instances of these sorts of mishaps for any real support for that claim (see other reviews, for example). Virgin is not much better than a low cost carrier, and I must confess that the seats in my Jetstar flight to get to Sydney were far more spacious that those on Virgin. Disappointing - we really do need a competitor for Qantas but Virgin is a long way from that!

### "a full service airline?"
Gold Coast to Melbourne. Seriously you call this a full service airline? After an hour inflight the flight attendant serves a tiny bag if pretzels and says we can have a tiny cup of water, orange, tea or coffee. I can see Qantas have no competition in Australia. Seats were jammed in like sardines and there was no televisions on-board, passengers were expected to purchase and bring their own tablets on board to watch any entertainment!

### "charging me for being a musician"
Perth to Melbourne. I find it absurd that we can only have 1 item to check in. I have a guitar and was not allowed to take it on as hand luggage because it was over sized and my suitcase was 11 kg. Collectively they weigh 15 kg. So even though I was under the weight limit by 8 kg I still would have to pay excess. For this reason I will know not to fly with Virgin Australia because I always fly with my guitar and usually need clothes as well. You are charging me for being a musician. Weight limit, not quantity, should be the criteria.

### "This is abysmal service"
Melbourne to Adelaide. We were notified at 1.45 am on the day of our flight scheduled at 8.10 am that Virgin had cancelled our flight due to weather conditions (which was hard to believe as it was 30 degrees). My fiancee missed her wedding dress fitting that we flew to Adelaide for, specifically as Virgin refused to allow us to get an earlier flight when there were seats left, and we just had hand luggage. Virgin Australia's response was "Just get a refund and pay for another airlines flight", which was double the expense! This is abysmal service from an airline I had previously trusted. Really not happy!

### "staff on the flight unfriendly"
The flight was from London to Sydney via Abu Dhabi, codeshared with Etihad, with the Abu Dhabi to Sydney flight operated by Virgin Australia. It was a full fare booked through Etihad so I expected a full fare flight experience. Upon arrival, we had no gate and had to use connecting buses. The staircase had to be delivered 3 times because the first 2 were broken. The staff on the flight was unfriendly and one of them did not show a single smile throughout the 14 hour flight. I asked for a snack mid flight and was told to wait 15 minutes, it turned out to be a 30 minute wait. Water and beverages were also sparsely given out during the flight. This whole experience was not deserving of the price I paid, especially when being compared to the level of service provided by Etihad in the first leg of the flight.

### "not a very pleasant flying experience"
Flew Virgin Australia yesterday from Proserpine to Brisbane on VA 1118. Sat in 12C to discover that the seating area had not been cleaned from the previous flight, and that the seat did not recline. Served 1 very small biscuit in a packet, along with coffee, which was complementary. Alcoholic drinks are now A$8.00 Cabin staff were not pleasant and it was obviously an effort to do their job. It is a huge decline in the Virgin Australia product. Virgin Australia aircraft seem to be getting that very well worn look. Their aircraft are aging. Not a very pleasant flying experience.

### "cabin crew make the difference"
Los Angeles to Melbourne via Sydney. LAX though is a nightmare but thats not their fault. Though you do check in at terminal three and then have to go outside to TBIT to go through security. You get use of the Etihad lounge when you fly business which is great. Meals onboard were ok but not a stand out. Seats are very comfortable as is the bed. No wifi offered on board and they should probably look into this. I'd flown with Etihad, Icelandair, Air Berlin and American and it was offered on all flights. We were late leaving and late landing and then sat on the tarmac for half an hour and missed our connection. Bags were off pretty quickly so we got to the transfer desk before it got really busy. We were due to fly business to Melbourne but the flights were full for three hours so elected to fly economy rather than wait and will get refunded. Transfer to domestic unlike Qantas is via the road rather than air side so you need to go through security again. Would be nicer if you could just get dropped airside at domestic. The cabin crew are what make the difference and having just flown with American Airlines the difference was marked.

### "service was absolutely horrible"
I flew with Virgin last week from Gold Coast to Sydney and the service we received was absolutely horrible. Our flight was cancelled due to poor weather, there was no communication to passengers till after the time that the flight was due to take off. The ground crew did not offer any support or information. Not one staff member could tell us what was happening, we were just instructed to collect our bags and wait. Lack of communication, rude staff and no service at all - I advised one of the ground crew that I was tired and just wanted to find out what was going on and her response was - "I'm tired too". She was getting paid to be there - I was not. She was even asking passengers to say please when requesting a flight the following day. I couldn't believe what I was seeing.

### "a lot of room for improvement"
Brisbane to Townsville with Virgin Australia. Seating on this aircraft had seen better days. They were pretty dirty as well as the magazine and the safety card. The flight attendants were extremely friendly but didn't really do anything to stop the screaming kids in the row in front. Meal was good - peanuts. Overall, this airline is good but there is a lot of room for improvement.

### "Good customer service"
Caught the 9:15pm Virgin Australia flight from Auckland to Brisbane. Was a 45 min delayed flight but still managed to get there on time. Good customer service from the Cabin Crew and food presentation was awesome. Would have been better if there were tv screens on all seats and inflight entertainment via our own portable device is good.

### "a treat compared with Air NZ"
Apia, Samoa to Auckland. Virgin Australia has first two rows on the Boeing 737 in Business Class. The seats for so-called short international flights are comfortable, but no big recline. The food choice was rather limited but nice presentation and crew tried to accommodate my wishes. Entertainment with sort of I-pad was okay with good choice of new films. The crew was very friendly and efficient, quite a treat compared with Air New Zealand service on the same routing.

### "economy cabin features very comfortable seats"
Travelled with Virgin Australia from Sydney to London via Abu Dhabi, with the AUH-LHR route being operated by Etihad Airways. Now, the flight operated by Virgin Australia was extremely comfortable. Their B777-300ER has recently been "renovated," and the economy cabin features very comfortable seats that recline with ease, and quite far back. Virgin Australia have put in a lot of effort as to customer experience. As it was a long haul flight, a little travel pack was provided. Where many other airlines don't provide this, or when they do, it's in a cheap feeling plastic bag, Virgin provided a nicely made zip-lock bag, which I feel is better, as it can be used for more things, and lasts longer. The actual items in the bag were of a higher quality too - the eye mask was very good, and blocked out all of the light, and fit my face quite snugly. The earplugs were also very good, and blocked out the majority of the noise in the cabin. As for the flight experience, it was an overnight, and sleep quality was surprisingly good for economy class. The seats recline quite far back, and the cabin also has ambient lighting to enhance sleep. As for the meals, I ordered the gluten free meal as I suffer from coeliac disease, and it was of good quality. As for the codeshare, I cannot say the same thing. There is a discrepancy with the code share when ordering special meals that mean that all non Virgin flights operated flights don't have the special meal on board (meaning I was not given food for 24 hours from London to Sydney, or from Abu Dhabi to London, as they were all operated by Etihad). However, I can safely say that the Virgin flight was possible the best flight I've done from Sydney to London (I fly that route quite a lot)

### "inflight service up to standard"
Sydney to Los Angeles, connecting to New York JFK with Delta. When I checked in the Virgin staff told me that there was a new product available for purchase that delivered extra legroom but as my flight wasn’t at capacity she could allocate me one of these seats gratis. She then took a card with a map of LAX and drew the route I would need to take to make my transfer to Delta at LAX. This was an excellent example of customer service strategy. The inflight service was up to standard, food excellent with vegetarian options and vegan/gluten free meals available on request prior to the flight. The inflight entertainment offers a decent amount of TV shows, movies and albums, however no news channels is upheld here. It’s bizarre to me that they can’t provide one news program, even if it is slightly out of date. Current affairs programming would also be very welcome. There was an issue with the headphone jack disengaging on a frequent basis and I needed to jiggle it to find the sweet spot to permit the sound to flow through, but this was minor. The Delta transfer at was a different story. The food consisted of crackers, nuts and not a piece of fruit but rather a slice of fruit. The Delta plane was in a dishevelled state, with wet toilet paper and paper towel on the floor and sink of the rest room. Codeshares are complex deals and I’m sure both carriers benefit from this partnership, but from a service continuity perspective the alliance with Delta is detrimental to Virgin Australia. It’s the only major flaw in what is otherwise an outstanding product. I need to make mention of the Virgin Australia twitter team who attend to all my enquiries within an hour of me tweeting. This makes life so much easier when you’re on the go and don’t have time to make a call or a formal online enquiry.

### "food was extremely over priced"
Flew from Hobart to Brisbane on Boxing day. Flight was running 30 mins late and no apology was given. Seat did not recline much and food was extremely over priced. For inflight entertainment you have to download an app. Flight attendants didn't seam to care about customer service. I only flew Virgin because thy were the only airline that flew direct from Hobart to Brisbane direct. Next time I fly I'll probably fly Qantas.

### "staff were standoffish and appeared disinterested"
I have noticed a continual decline both in service and the product offering on Virgin in recent years. On my most recent flight to Brisbane, check-in in Los Angeles was easy (despite the odd process of checking in at the Delta terminal then walking across to Tom Bradley to go through security) however the airline ignored my seat request. On the plane, staff were standoffish and appeared disinterested. Cabin staff used to be the highlight of flying Virgin for me. One male flight attendant made a habit of thumping my shoulder any time he had a question to ask me. Food was an absolute joke. Likening it to fast food would be rich. The choice of entertainment wasn't particularly broad and definitely nothing compared to Qantas or even Delta. The only positive was the seat which felt roomier than other airlines.

### "will not fly Virgin again"
Sydney to Perth return. My experience with Virgin Australia was terrible. I booked a points redemption to visit my family in Perth. The flight over was delayed twice after I arrived at the airport (announcement said it was due to cascading delays much earlier that day but with no pre-advice before going to the airport). Then the flight was cancelled. I waited at Kingsford Smith airport almost 7 hrs. My daughter in-law died unexpectedly the next day and her funeral was set for the day I was to return to Sydney. I called Virgin (waiting 30 mins to speak to a person) and I was told their were no seats available on flights late that day or on the next day. I explained the situation and also mentioned the delay coming over but they were unaccommodating. I looked on line and Virgin were selling economy class seats on later flights for that day. I called back with another long wait to speak to a person but again was told they could do nothing. They told me that they had cancelled my return flight. I had not explicitly asked them to do this but I had said that I would have to try Qantas or Jetstar when they said they could not change my flight. The call centre staff I spoke to had good English but they were English as a second language speakers and that could be why they interpreted my comment as a cancellation but even so that was another point of extremely poor customer service. I will not fly Virgin again. I booked my flight home with Qantas even though Virgin had seats available.

### "the product could be better"
Perth to Melbourne. After a bad experience with Qantas (treated myself by booking a Business Class flat bed, got an old ex-Jetstar seat and no warning, apology or compensation), I chose Virgin on a recent trip to Melbourne. Ground staff were fine, I was a little surprised not to be asked for ID on either flight though. Cabin crew were friendly and professional. Cabin interior was acceptable, but could have been cleaner. Seats have the same pitch as Qantas, but somehow feel more like Jetstar (black leather included). Apparently they're going to be flying to Abu Dhabi in these aircraft, I hope they have a refit because while the seats are OK for 4 hours, I wouldn't like to spend 11 hours in them. IFE works well - can be used from gate to gate, and there's a much wider range of programs than are listed in the magazine. There was enough choice to sustain interest, but it definitely feels like it's not the A-list. Supplied headphones were awful, they sell "premium" earphones in the food menu, but I just used my own (bring a 2-pin adapter). I didn't notice any under-seat metal boxes housing the IFE equipment, that's definitely a positive. On flights to and from Perth they provide a hot meal. You can't choose ahead of time, but kudos for providing a vegetarian option. Sadly though it's not very good, a small box of pasta with not enough sauce and a tiny tub of (admittedly tasty) mousse. I used to lament the decline in Qantas's meal offering, but this is several steps down. At least the Grant Burge wine was good. Both flights arrived pretty much on time, ex-Melbourne it took a long time to leave the gate and get airborne. My verdict on Economy class: staff are good, the rest of the product could be better. I have 2 more trips coming up, so I should be able to observe any trends.

### "the most disappointing of all was the service"
Check-in was smooth, boarding efficient. The plane itself was clean, seats comfortable. Good pitch between seats. The selection for the inflight entertainment was excellent. For a main meal the offering seemed pretty poor, the butter chicken came in a small cardboard box and it was all rice with two pieces of chicken. Small cup of mousse for dessert. I noticed other passengers asking for seconds. The most disappointing of all was the service. The meal took a long time to arrive and even longer to be taken away. Later, a request for a drink from the galley took an hour to fulfil as clearly the staff wanted everyone to wait for the cart to roll through. Ive had much better service from Jetstar and Tiger.

### "this is an airline in full cost cutting mode"
It is crystal clear from my experience flying Perth to Melbourne with Virgin Australia, that this is an airline in full cost cutting mode, and is now just nothing more than Tigerair with lipstick on. Myself and a friend had booked and paid for extra legroom tickets for our journey over 5 months in advance. At 2am before and early morning flight I received a text message which barely made any sense to state that I was no longer booked on the flight and re-booked to a later flight that will travel via Sydney. The only explanation for this was “engineering troubles” meant the plane for the route was downgraded to a 737. Anyone with basic knowledge of the industry knows this is just a standard ploy by airlines to cut costs. If the larger plane is not booked to capacity, bring in a smaller plane in its place and boot the remainder of booked passengers off the flight. This saves overheads and fuel, especially for cross-country flights such as this. Of course customer service staff didn’t seem fussed that we were put out in total travel time by 5 hours and had lost our extra legroom seats. Not only could we not get refunded for these seats at the time, myself and my friend were not even seated together for the flights from Perth to Sydney and Sydney to Melbourne. And of course it is incumbent upon the passenger to call up customer service and be placed on hold for long periods if you wish to even get a partial refund for what the airline blatantly failed to provide you with. Then the kicker on the flight back for any early Monday morning departure was this. We attempted to perform an online check-in on the morning of our flight but were not allowed to do so due to having an outstanding payment that I owed on the fare. This was not the case at all and in fact I was owed a refund at the time! There was traffic chaos that morning on the way to Tullamarine and we only arrived at the terminal 35 minutes prior to departure. We were immediately told the flight was closed and herded to a massive “customer service” queue that was staffed by one person and not moving at all. Seemed obvious Virgin’s intention is to do everything in their power to prevent paying passengers from boarding their flights. It seems this is a business directive from higher up to cut further costs. The check-in and baggage drop queues that morning came to a standstill twice as they are clearly not employing the requisite number of baggage handlers and customer service staff to service the amount of passengers travelling at peak times (there were 4 staff on the front desk of the Velocity Lounge painting their nails though). The paying passenger gets treated like livestock on a boat and is forced to pay more money to get a seat on another flight because of this.

### "service on board unfriendly and surly"
On 26 November the one daily flight from Hervey Bay to Sydney was 90 minutes late. The pilot was completely insouciant as to the delay - nil apology offered despite everyone missing their connections in SYD. Service on board unfriendly, surly and akin to sibling Tigerair. Being lunchtime, I was proffered a minuscule half-biscuit. Virgin Australia has now become but a pale shadow of its former self. Staff seemed interested only in flogging food to buy from the "menu'. Back to Qantas for this passenger.

### "attendants were very pleasant"
Los Angeles to Sydney. The flight was late leaving due to headwinds and the need to offload some freight. The new seats in business class are the best I have experienced. They are roomy, comfortable, very private with enough storage. The IFE was mostly good with new TV and movie releases. The airshow map was informative and easy to read. Flight attendants were very pleasant and I woke up to find an attendant placing a blanket over me. Food and drink excellent. Despite being late leaving the flight arrived near the stated arrival time. Platinum Velocity members can use the Star Alliance First Class Lounge at LAX.

### "pretty much everything wrong"
Flew Melbourne to Sydney. I've been with Virgin for near on 5 years now. It's clear they've lost their way. They're no longer taking the fight to Qantas and the experience not only feels low cost carrier, but it has a lot of LCC elements. The "complimentary snack" is deplorable, regardless of the time of day. (You aren't fooling anyone.) The premium frequent flyer enhancements are rarely available (fly forward / premium exit etc.) The move away from in air Foxtel to byod seemed plausible at the time but there is such limited content and no USB or AC for charging across the fleet. (Excluding their 11 wide body aircraft which have IFE.) Worst of all, they are now usually more expensive than qantas with an inferior offering to jetstar. Frequent flyers will understand my pain as now I have to transition back over to Qantas. It's slow and painful but one airline is doing things right and the other, pretty much everything wrong.

### "felt very budget, basic"
Melbourne to Canberra with Virgin Australia. The flight was delayed, we weren't told until past departure time. I liked how they called the back rows first for boarding, it makes sense to do that. Well done. Of course you'll always get others who ignore that. I wish they'd make them stand aside as the reason is efficiency in boarding. The pilot told us the conditions would be turbulent leaving Canberra and we'd be delayed into Melbourne due to winds and the fact they only had one runway open. The seat itself was tight, there was an empty muesli bar wrapper in my husbands seat pocket. It felt very budget, basic. We were offered tea / coffee / juice. Juice was a tiny pot. Plus we got a small pack of odd chick pea salt and vinegar rings. Yuk. Didn't matter for the short hop though. The staff were quite pleasant. Glad to see that on arrival they opened the back door to make exiting more efficient. After flying to Canberra Qantas and back Virgin, I'd say Qantas were better though.

### "an experience worth having"
Hobart to Melbourne. Virgin Australia have a great system of offering passengers the chance to upgrade to Business Class. A passenger makes an offer of what he/she is prepared to pay for this upgrade. I was successful with a bid of $225. I am on holiday and decided that I will treat myself. This is not the first time I have done this; the experience is worth a few extra dollars. A professional experience in business class, but then, so they are in economy. Only a one hour flight, but the extra space, attention and food is worth the occasional splurge. Only eight seats on this aircraft, with two occupied. This is an experience worth having. If you haven't done it already, try it. You'll be back for more.

### "outstanding customer service"
Brisbane to Los Angeles. I had a very good experience recently with Virgin Australia which deserves recognition. My wife and I had booked flights to Colombia through Delta Airlines, for which Virgin Australia operated the flight from Brisbane to Los Angeles. We had not confirmed that our infant son had been entered on the booking (our fault) by the time we got to the airport, so could not check him in in the conventional way. We went to the ticket desk to see if we could get him on the booking, a guy there took us through the entire process of calling Delta in the USA, setting up the payment, loading the info into Virgin´s system, and checking us in, all while dealing with multiple other issues (radio calls about luggage loading, late passengers etc). Because we had not got this booking sorted out before we got to the airport it was much harder for him to do it manually, but he stuck with us and got us on the plane, assuring us all the way that we would make the flight. Myself and my family are extremely grateful to Virgin Australia and the staff especially for this outstanding customer service. I would recommend Virgin Australia to anyone after this experience.

### "crew looked happy"
Canberra to Brisbane. Lounge was pleasant in Canberra although I tried to use on of their computers as my battery was flat and their two computers were in need of considerable repair, keys that didn't work, very slow connection etc. Flight was fine, crew looked happy, level of attention to passengers in Business was adequate. Only ate olives and had a glass of wine. Late into Brisbane because of air traffic.

### "I will not fly them again"
Flew from Sydney to Christchurch. There were problems even before we boarded. We were supposed to board at 7:15p.m. but the plane hadn't even arrived at the gate. Communication between Virgin Australia and customers were laughable. We were not told of any delays until we were told it was time to board. It seems that to prevent negative advertising, the company did not use Sydney airport's PA system for fear of other travellers hearing and instead told us the delay on the aircraft. What is the use of mentioning a delayed boarding after the passengers have already boarded? As if the delay wasn't enough, the flight attendants were frustrated throughout the journey. They pushed the drink trolley around so fast that I did not have time to even flag them down for a cup of water! When we landed, the flight attendant on the microphone told us in a threatening manner that as customs shuts down their computers at 3am, we would need to hurry as we only had 25 minutes to disembark, go through border security and leave the airport. The way she was speaking, it was as if it was our fault the flight was delayed in the first place. My first flight with Virgin Australia was a bad one and I will not fly them again - unless their tickets are as cheap as this flight.

### "recommend flying with them"
Sydney to Perth. The queue for bag drop at Sydney airport is quite long, but the friendliness of the check-in staff made up for it. The seat is comfortable and has a nice IFE screen, but choice of entertainment might be a little less than one may expect but allows for binge watching. The meal was very tasty, though I noticed the portion is smaller than it used to be. However, staff later brought some snacks (muffins if I recall) along so that made up for a still hungry stomach. The pilot's announcements were informative and humorous, giving us helpful information on the initial departure delay and during in-flight. Considering how much I paid for this ticket, this was excellent value for money and I would recommend flying with them.

### "the cabin crew was outstanding"
Melbourne to Brisbane. On time boarding and push back. Drinks and light refreshments (9pm flight) were available shortly after take off. My partner was ill earlier in the day and fainted on the flight when walking down the aisle. The calm, professional assistance from the cabin crew was outstanding, genuinely caring and supportive. The pilot who spoke to us after everyone had disembarked was quite insensitive and made a rude comment about the risk my partner posed by boarding the flight after feeling unwell during the the day. He made us both feel extremely guilty, saying that they almost diverted to Sydney, which would have cost the airline a lot of money in fines. Whilst I understand the seriousness of what happened and the implications redirecting the plane would have on the passengers, crew and airline, I felt that it was extremely out of place for the pilot to make that comment. No one wakes up and decides to be sick, or faint on a plane. If my partner had felt as unwell as he did in the morning, he would not have boarded the plane. He however felt fine and just wanted to get back home. There was no sympathy, concern or compassion shown by that pilot. We disembarked feeling very guilty, but grateful to have been taken care of by such wonderful flight attendants. Will I continue to exclusively fly Virgin domestically and their affiliated partners internationally? Yes, however I don't rate them as highly anymore after this incident with the pilot.

### "my expectations were met"
Virgin Australia for me has the best in flight comfort. Purchased food from the on board menu and it was superb. Check in was effortless. The airport crew were pretty friendly. It was my first time to travel with Virgin Australia and I was so happy with the way how the staff treated me. From the ground, to the sky, my expectations were met.

### "cabin service was efficient"
Brisbane to Sydney. First time I have flown Virgin Australia in a number of years and it has improved. Seat and seat pitch is fine for the domestic flight and the new included services such as baggage, snack and BOD entertainment is very nice. Self check-in is quick, bag drop line is long but moved quickly. Boarding was fast using both the rear stairs and the front air-bridge. Cabin service was efficient and friendly. Overall a good flight there and back.

### "waited 40 minutes"
VA761, Melbourne to Gold Coast on 2 September. Was originally booked on a 19.00 hour flight back to Brisbane. On check in me and my travelling companions were told flight cancelled and to wait to be rebooked. Waited 40 minutes and allocated this flight which was only going to Gold Coast leaving 20.10pm. Before departure negotiated a taxi fare from Gold Coast to South Brisbane which Virgin agreed to pay for our group. Plane departed about 25 minutes late. On arrival at Gold Coast picked up taxi voucher at service desk for cab to south Brisbane. Finally arrived home at 1am, would have been later if not been provided with Taxi.

### "cabin crew friendly and hospitable"
It is almost 1 hour from Melbourne to Sydney - so this is really not much more than a nice bus trip with Virgin Australia. Thankfully my family member travels a lot more than I do for work so he invited me to join him at the Lounge. It made the trip a lot more pleasant. The aircraft itself was a 10 year old B737-800 that appeared to be in fair condition. I sat in row 3 where there is sufficient legroom for a tall bloke like me, which was comfortable. The seats a little skinny but cannot fault the legroom. It was a nice smooth unremarkable flight where the cabin crew were friendly and hospitable and offered me a coffee and a muesli bar. We had already filled up on pancakes in the lounge. IFE worked great on my tablet without lag and had excellent map of flight. Really enjoyed watching that.

### "dissatisfied with check-in"
Wellington to Brisbane. Very dissatisfied with check-in and ticketing. Check-in staff gave incorrect information on opening time for departure gates. Ticketing for this airport should inform customer prior to ticket purchase that they will not be able to access business class lounge,  as the airport does not open at all until 2 hours before flights. This should be outlined on ticket. Misleading use of business class conditions for the customer as not all perks are able to be used. Should be due a refund of difference as this is one of the reasons people purchase business class. Very disappointing.

### "they don't have low fares"
Gold Coast to Melbourne with Virgin Australia. This airline is very similar to Ryanair in Europe except they don't have low fares. Fares are priced at a premium, seats are jammed in, there is no onboard WiFi or televisions. Lunch was 3 crackers, chunk of cheese and either tea / coffee or water - soft drinks extra and in fact anything of flavour or substance was extra. They try sell this airline as being similar or competition to Qantas but there is no way this is true. They used to have live satellite tv on board but I guess cost cutting put an end to this - shocker of an airline.

### "left much to be desired"
Melbourne - Sydney - Melbourne. Check in fast. Departed on time. Full flight. A quick snack served. However quality and quantity left much to be desired. Virgin Australia crew standards have dropped a lot over the years. Both flights offered VA streaming entertainment however due to some glitches could not be used. Arrived on time at destination. Overall good flight for a short hop.

### "only downside was the crew"
Short flight from Sydney to Coffs Harbour (around 35-40 minutes) with Virgin Australia. Smooth flight, legroom good and seat comfortable. The only downside was the crew, I greeted both staff as I boarded via the rear stairs, they did not reply to me just nodded their heads without a smile, which I think is unacceptable. Sadly Virgin Australia will never compare with Qantas in my book.

### "will take business class again"
A last minute decision to book ourselves to business on Virgin Australia A330 from Perth to Sydney. The  service and the comfort of the seat really give a tired traveller a rest on the flight. The IFE screen is good size. They serve a 3 course meal for lunch and dinner. Even it's a last minute booking, we were given the full 3 course dinner. The seat tray is good size for those who want to work onboard. It also come with USB for charging your mobile device and universal power charging point for laptop. The seat can transform into a flat bed for a nap. The cabin switch to soft ambient lamp after meal service which is good for relaxing. Definitely will take business class again if my purse allows for Coast to Coast .

### "customer service is always bad"
Flew from Brisbane to Melbourne. This is unfortunately like all the other time with Virgin. Rude and just to the rules. Had 1 kg over weight and she also found 1 kg over weight in carry on. I asked her how much for 2 check-in bags and it was 70 AUD. So she asked me to move 1 kg (3 poloshirts) to my suitcase and pay for the 2 kg. Which when she presented bill also was AUD 70. She could have told me and we could have saved the hassle and time. Customer service is always bad with Virgin.

### "zero customer care"
Virgin cancelled our flight from Sydney to Christchurch after a long haul journey. We were treated like an inconvenience by the Virgin staff in Sydney. After repeatedly requesting information regarding times of the next flight all we got in return is 'we are trying to book you a hotel'. We were stood for an hour and still no hotel information or next flight times were provided. Zero customer care at the airport and did not give the promised refund due to a cancellation.

### "delightful supervisor onboard"
Brisbane to Sydney with Virgin Australia. This flight was delayed almost an hour due to heavy rains in Sydney. We had such a delightful male supervisor onboard this flight. His bright smile made the flight experience such a pleasant one. I was asked to change my seat as another passenger wanted to talk to his friend. There was a bit of commotion there but then the crew calmness and professionalism was excellent and I had to comment to the supervisor that seriously I can't do his job as they had to pretend that the voice raising was not taking place but ensuring that the rest of us were comfortable.

### "told they had run out"
We travelled as a family of 3 from Auckland to Coolangatta with Virgin Australia. We bought the works package tickets that included a Meal and an Entertainment device. At the beginning of the flight we waited patiently for the stewardess to distribute the IPads. After half an hour we had to ask for one which we were told they had run out. When the meals came around we were told they only had 1 Beef meal and the rest were Vegetarian. We should have flown Emirates.

### "7 hours late"
Delays after delays after delays. Flew Virgin Australia from Melbourne to Perth. Our flight was 12.40pm. After boarding we waited on board for about an hour before being unloaded. Went back to the terminal. Another wait of 90 minutes before getting back on the plane. Then an hour on board before being unloaded again due to technical issues. Flight got cancelled. Bumped to later flight. That flight went smoothly, until the end of the flight when the door wouldn't open or some other technical fault. Flight was scheduled to arrive in Perth at 3pm, we ended up getting off the flight at 10pm, 7 hours late.

### "very disappointed in Virgin Australia"
In March we purchased our tickets to fly to Fiji for our holiday. The flight was direct return flight from Melbourne to Nadi. We paid for it and got our tickets. Today we received an email form Virgin Australia telling us that there was a change to our return flight and that we now have to fly Brisbane then to Melbourne. They did exactly the same thing last year. They change our tickets and from leaving Melbourne at a respectable time we were put on 6am flight. We had to be at the airport at 4am. Once in Brisbane we had to change plane, which required taking a train to the international airport, that also means that they flew us domestic to Brisbane. We thought oh well things happen and so forth, however this year Virgin Australia is doing the same thing. They not only changed our flight, they changed the flight route! When we inquired about it they stated the operational reasons. What a nonsense! How is possible for any organisation to know in June that they will have 'operational reasons', that will forced them to change flight, in December? It is obviously a commercial reason of not having enough passengers for the direct flight to Melbourne. How come that they only have those "operational reasons" an a week day but hardly ever on Saturdays and Sundays? The international flight, that is more expensive to run and that we paid for, finishes now in Brisbane and the passengers need to go collect their luggage, go through customs, take a bus, queue up to be checked into a domestic flight, that is subsequently also cheaper to run. A clever way to avoid paying more tax to the government too. We are very disappointed in Virgin Australia, their customer service was also appalling and we will of course avoid flying with them as much as possible.

### "very little attention after meal"
Perth to Brisbane. Flight delayed due to a fault and had to get off the plane with all bags and then back on board so left and arrived about two hours late.This was well taken by passengers and if it is a full you want it to be fixed. Virgin Australia don't do special meals on domestic flights so little to eat for me, glass of wine that I had was OK. Seats on Boeing 737 hard to sleep on from PER even in full recline. Crew member looking after Business did everything one at a time and slowly (e.g. if you asked for a water and a wine they arrived separately several minutes apart). Meant service gave the impression of not really caring. Very little attention after meal was served. Not nearly as good as the A330 flights to PER. Bags also took some time to arrive, this was the last flight to arrive and so may have had few staff left.

### "lost its personality over the years"
Melbourne to Canberra return on Virgin Australia. Did online check-in and had no check in bags so straight to lounge. Good cosy lounge. Boarded and left on time. Crew somewhat distant. Comfy 2-2 arrangement. On time arrival in CBR. Return same. Online check in straight to lounge. Departed and arrived on time. Drinks service on short 50 minute flight. Crew again robotic. Good experience from A-B. But feel VA has lost its personality over the years.

### "well above standard"
VA 694, Perth to Melbourne (A330) with Virgin Australia. This evening flight, left on time and incurred minimal turbulence en route to Melbourne. While I was surprised that I had to ask for both a blanket and an amenity kit (both of which should be offered pre-departure or shortly after take-off), it was quickly made up for by the hospitality of the FAs and high-quality of food served. I was served a great champagne (Ayala 2006) and my glass was never left unfilled for more than a minute. As for the food itself, I found both the pumpkin soup entree and vegetable lasagne to be well above standard. The in-flight entertainment which was in the form of a touch-screen tv and noise-cancelling headphones worked perfectly and included a wide range of both blockbuster and classic movies.

### "VA delivered"
VA 683 from Melbourne to Perth (A330) with Virgin Australia. After reading the raving reviews of VAs new Business class aka 'The Business' suite, I embarked with high expectations. VA delivered. I was impressed with the entire setup, from the spacious cabin to the friendly yet professional FAs to the comfortable yet modern business suites. Highly recommend.

### "staff were very friendly"
VA 309, Melbourne to Brisbane (B737-800) with Virgin Australia. Another really enjoyable flight. The ground staff were very friendly and even though I slept during the entire flight, I appreciated the opportunity to enjoy the complimentary tea/coffee and a snack.

### "cannot reach my destination on time"
Brisbane to Melbourne with Virgin Australia. The flight was suppose to fly at 7:55am. It was then delayed until 9:30am, Second delay at 10:10am and then 12:00pm. No clarity about what is going on - we were given an $8 voucher to use in the terminal. Cannot get anything from there apart from a large coffee for $6.60. You hand the voucher over and effectively fixed to get a $6 item for $8. Unfortunately this airline is a balance between Qantas and Tiger / Jetstar but this balance is shifting for me. If by paying this much I cannot reach my destination on time then it is no use.

### "wasn't worth the price"
Sydney to Hobart with Virgin Australia. By far the worst Australian airline. We flew with them on our holiday to Tasmania earlier this year and the experience wasn't worth the price. Lack of staff at check in counters and an unexplained 45 minute delay. No apology was given to us at the end. To make matters worse, the plane was very old and dirty. I found packets from the previous flight in my seat pocket. Call button was repeatedly rejected and I was dying of thirst in the dry cabin. Legroom was minimal and seats were worn out and lumpy. We landed in Hobart tired from a 2 hour inflight nightmare.

### "FA’s were generally friendly"
VA 820, Sydney to Melbourne (B737-800) with Virgin Australia. This was a connecting flight from an international flight. The transfer was very smooth and I was acknowledged as a Velocity Gold member by being offered complimentary exit row seat which usually comes at an additional cost. The flight departed and arrived on time and the FA’s were generally friendly. Happy to continue being loyal to VA as their service has remained consistent in my humble opinion.

### "security was seamless"
VA 342, Brisbane to Melbourne (B737-800) with Virgin Australia. Passing through security was seamless even though it was at peak time (4.55pm) because I went through the line dedicated from Business/Velocity Platinum and Gold members since I was a Velocity Gold member. I was politely recommended by one of the security staff to try recently opened the premium entry which was just past the baggage claim since it takes you directly up to the VA lounge and has a much smaller queue. The VA lounge was packed which was unsurprising but I was still able to get a seat and enjoy a few drinks before the flight. The flight left a little later than scheduled but was still able to land on time. The inflight service was updated to include a refreshed line of TV series and movies. Food was in the form of a snack sized pack of biscuits and only Tea & Coffee or Water were served complimentary. Overall – good flight.

### "puts the cattle back in Cattle Class"
Decided to go to niece's 18th birthday party in Townsville for the weekend with Virgin Australia from Canberra. Flights cancelled and allocated later flights on the way out and on the way home, resulting in 4 hours delays getting home at the end of the weekend. Asked if we could use the lounge during the 4 hour delay on the way home - told 'no'. Food was tiny portions and indifferent quality, we paid much the same as if we had flown Qantas. Virgin puts the cattle back in Cattle Class - customer service is clearly not a priority. You can only suspect our flights were cancelled to fill later flights. I'm not a great fan of Qantas, but this is not my first bad experience with Virgin. I will be avoiding travelling Virgin as far as possible in the future.

### "the food was awful"
Brisbane to Los Angeles. I bid for economy premium. Paid far too much and lost the money I had paid for priority seating (my choice although I believe it is bad practice by airline not to carry that amount over towards bid price. The armrest next to me did not raise. My main complaint was the food was awful. I thought for all the extra money I paid I might have had a nice meal. I wrote to the Guest Relations Coordinator of Virgin and received an "apology for my disappointment. The flight route is convenient for me on Virgin Australia as I do fly frequently but I will have to rethink using Virgin Australia next time.

### "service was exemplary"
The service from check in to arrival with Virgin Australia was exemplary flying from Brisbane to Perth. Although the A330 is clearly a better cabin for a flight of this length many of the features such as champagne prior to take off and a comprehensive menu were evident on the 737. Food was of a high quality for my wife, my soup was delicious but the main salad very unappetising. This was the only let down, in all a vary enjoyable flight. New PER terminal is great - we had our bags within 12 minutes of leaving the plane.

### "seating was incredibly comfortable"
Flew home from Gold Coast to Melbourne in Business Class and was very impressed. The crew, seat, food and beverages and cabin ambience were excellent. A quiet cabin with only 4 guests on the way home. Seating was incredibly comfortable with nice leather seats and an extra wide adjustable headrest. Dinner was served comprising of a beef pie, cucumber salad and chocolates to finish. The crew came around with snacks and drinks throughout the flight and nothing was a problem. My only concern was of the presentation of the fittings up the front. Some evidence of wear and tear with scuff marks in some areas and the seat next to me had some crumbs left behind from the last passenger. Overall, a comfortable and hospitable flight with excellent cabin crew. I will certainly be back and to sit up the front in the future. Well done Virgin Australia.

### "meals were not inspiring"
Flew Hobart to Melbourne with Virgin Australia. Both flights left early and arrived on time. On outward journey was offered water only on boarding. Meals were not inspiring. On return journey grumpy check in staff neglected to put priority tag on baggage. To me this implies that Virgin is letting standards slip. For such a short journey would not pay for business.

### "avoid like the plague"
Virgin Australia cancelled flights from Brisbane to Port Vila in January until repairs on the runway were finished. Remedial works were finished some time ago, yet passengers who have already purchased tickets continue to hang in the wind, the company heedless of the effects on the rest of their travel plans and the losses they will accrue. I have tried calling the call center and the social media team repeatedly, they know nothing and the email for complaints doesn't reply. This is very unprofessional. Flights were supposed to recommence May 2nd, now May 23rd "maybe, we can't say". Utter rubbish, avoid like the plague.

### "bad experience still continues"
Melbourne to Adelaide. I had a previous bad experience with Virgin Australia and it still continues. I made a purchase of two tickets, one ticket had an additional bag so the assumption is 69 kilos accross three bags. Last time I travelled with Virgin Australia I had to transfer weight from a 4th bag into three bags, there was no mention of weight allowances. I assumed 69kg meant 69kg. This customer service agent said that max weight per bag is 23 kilos no matter what. We were 4 kilos over on two bags, but in total we were well and truly under 69kg. They wanted to charge me $140 which was a joke. I asked for a manager, it would be 15 minutes as their manager was in a meeting. There was basically no supervisor on the floor, the one who was assisting with another complaint is not normally a supervisor. I was carrying an injury so the more I was standing the more my foot was in agony, the customer service agent was still firm stating that all baggage must be under 23kg or I would have to pay additional fees regardless of what happened in Adelaide. We managed to repack and change check in bags and transfer weight to be under 23kg on each bag. The customer service agent proceeded to tell me that they will allow my bags onboard on this occasion as it was not a full flight. I had a backpack which basically has my laptop, and I had a shoulder bag. Rules state that a laptop and laptop bag is not included as carry on, except agents tried to tell me my bag was a back pack and not a laptop bag. I showed them the laptop and the compartment, she still said there is stuff in there besides the laptop. I asked what is the policy, she said the bag is not necessarily a carry on, but it could be a carry on so no exact answer. Seems it depends on the mood of the agent, or if they have revenue targets to reach by charging additional baggage. Personally this is one time too many now, if I have international travel I would never ever travel Virgin Australia again. Domestic is not an issue because generally you are flying the one flight so you can handle 23kg easy. International flights have different allowances and always rounded to the last 10 digit, whereas Virgin is rounded to 3. I feel sorry for the flight crew because their customer service is top notch, ground staff are the only ones who stuffed this up. Also the combination of International check in and Domestic check in makes it confusing also which line to line up on.

### "food was excellent"
After having not flown with Virgin Australia for 6 months due to work commitments, I decided to take a quick weekend trip to Sydney and use my free-upgrades (available to VA Platinum members) while doing so. The online booking process was seamless as always and while I had to call up VA to make the upgrade from a Flexi-Economy ticket to Business, it was done in minutes. The flight too was great, I appreciated the friendly service from the FA(s) who were there when you needed them and not when you didn't. Because this was a short trip (1 hour), I was not offered a tablet to watch any IFE content, but that was not a problem since I had the Virgin Australia Entertainment mobile app which I used to stream free content via my iPhone. The food was excellent.

### "wonderful service"
Great flight with Virgin Australia from Melbourne to Brisbane. Wonderful service from lounge to flight to disembarkation. Especially appreciated being able to use the lounge upon arrival while waiting for my pick-up. Even though IFE was in the form of tablets, the pre-dowlnoaded Virgin Entertainment mobile app worked well on the flight and I was able to stream all kinds of content, incl. the latest movies, tv series and songs. The food was great too.

### "FA's were welcoming"
Brisbane to Melbourne on Virgin Australia. A very pleasant check-in experience followed by visit to a well appointed lounge. Boarding was smooth and the FA's were welcoming. The seats were spacious and quite comfortable. The dinner was tasty and the wine selection was good. The IFE was via tablets and the system was unstable requiring a number of reboots. Flight departed on time and landed ahead of schedule. I would definitely fly with them again.

### "onboard staff were really cheerful"
Melbourne to Denpasar, having done a search it appears this route is no longer in operation. Anyhow, I was running badly late - arriving at the airport with less than 90 minutes before my flight was due to leave. The staff were helpful in helping me get the flight and onboard staff were really cheerful too. The food served a little bit later than I'd have liked but I had the veggie pasta and it was really nice. The flight only cost me $30 more than the AirAsia flight to Bali and it was worth paying the extra. The only thing that disappoints me is the entertainment system. I have the Virgin app on my phone and it works intermittently but for a 6+ hour flight I would expect more.

### "a big improvement"
Sydney to Perth with Virgin Australia and excellent seats and service, similar to international business class. The new seats are lie flat seats and the IFE is excellent. Excellent menu and a choice of 3 white and red wines plus 2 dessert wines.This is a big improvement on the Sydney to Perth flights.

### "seat was awfully small"
Christchurch to Sydney. We applied my United Mileage Plus points to book a trip from Denver to Christchurch,  this review is the experience we had with Virgin Australia. We had to purchase that leg from the airline directly even though the mileage points should have covered it but some airlines are stingy about allocating awards program seating. All United flights on this route allowed us each one free check-in baggage. That seemed to be the norm as did the size and weight of an acceptable carry on, except with Virgin Australia. They charged us $87USD to check in one bag and sent us back to repack our carry on items since their acceptable weight was a lot lower than the other airlines. We had to awake at 2am to make a 6am flight and were told agents would arrive three hours earlier and we needed to be there to get seat assignments. We arrived a half hour early but the first agent started a half hour late and other agents arrived about an hour after that. The seat we were assigned was awfully small and at the last row of the plane where a constant line of people awaited toilet use. I had been trying to pre-assign seats since 6 months earlier but they did not allow us to do so all the way up till our flight day in March. I am 6'3" tall and as airlines make seats smaller and afford the people ahead the invasion on an already tight space, while that is a general problem, here it was ridiculous. I think all airlines that have reduced seat sizes should have options for taller people. Where I can, I try to book an aisle seat so I can stretch my leg or even book an economy Plus seat but they neither allowed that or showed any consciousness that this was happening.

### "would avoid them at all costs"
Melbourne to Hobart, and I would advise extreme caution if you're considering flying on Virgin Australia. We had just arrived in Melbourne after a lengthy trans-Pacific flight on United. Our flight was late in arriving due to a cyclone which caused us to vary our route in order to fly around it. We arrived about 1 hour and 20 minutes before our departing flight - a short domestic flight to Hobart, Tasmania. We arrived at Virgin check-in exactly 1/2 hour before our flight departed. The area was very crowded and there was no one other than the staff at the desks. We tried to check in at the kiosk but it said we were too late and to find a representative. When I finally found one, it was 25 minutes to flight time. She said she thought we'd be ok but our bags might have to come later and she started leading us toward a desk. When she asked what flight we arrived on and I answered United, everything changed. United is not a partner with Virgin and we were now out of luck. She sent us to another desk where we were told our fares were forfeited and we would have to buy new tickets which they would sell us for $1,200. After a lot of pleading and searching, we were put on a late flight (it was morning when we arrived so our entire day was lost) at a reduced cost of only $700! We were completely left out in the cold (due to circumstances beyond our control). That has never happened to me on a US airline, even when I've been at fault and I've seen American provide a Delta ticket and United provide a competitor's ticket. I wrote Virgin and they sent me what basically amounts to a "standard" letter about bookings which are not made together. The way I see it there are probably rules and reasons that permit airlines to do things that would disappoint almost every passenger on the plane. But, good airlines don't do those kinds of things and they do not adhere to the rule book when a customer is not at fault. It's bad business and an indicator of the value they place on you, the flier. For that reason, I would avoid them at all costs.

### "cabin crew were not overly friendly"
Had a return Virgin Australia flight from Brisbane to Canberra for Easter. Flight down left Brisbane at 7.15pm and return flight at 5.25pm. Both flights the only food as part of the fare was a biscuit with either a dip or cheese - unlike QANTAS where you would get a meal for those times. Cabin crew on both flights were not overly friendly compared to other Virgin flights. Enjoyed the inflight entertainment on my tablet.

### "solid flight with good service"
Wellington to Brisbane with Virgin Australia.Brief delay at check in. Wellington lounge was fine, need to go before call is made in the lounge however as there is only one queue. If in Business Class you need to get there for the first call if you want to be on quickly. No bubbly served on these flights and the wine was not great. Food was tasty and crew very obliging. Comfortable enough for a short flight of 3 hours. Slight delay due to Brisbane air traffic control, bags on carousel at arrival minutes after leaving the plane. Overall was a solid flight with good service.

### "embarrassment of an airline"
Brisbane to Christchurch. An international flight of over 3 hours that left at 8:30am and we got no food and no drink. We were told we would have to pay for a glass of orange juice so had put up with some water. The cabin staff  told us the only food being served was 'complimentary' as long as you paid for it before the flight. I'm afraid their definition of complimentary didn't match with ours. Before this flight, we flew with a variety of different Indonesian airlines (all internal and all less than 3 hours) and always got a snack and choice of drinks. Virgin Australia is an embarrassment of an airline.

### "happy with the experience"
Flew Virgin Australia from Sydney to Los Angeles and very happy with the experience. From check in to the onboard service, staff were efficient and friendly. Food of a good quality and tasty. Entertainment system offered plenty of options but was a little confusing to work out. Seat comfort was good for economy, but like any economy class not so great when seat in front is fully reclined.

### "very pleased with the flight"
Smooth Virgin Australia flight on the Boeing 777. Great service from the crew for the long trip back from Los Angeles to Sydney. The toilets were frequently checked and cleaned by the crew. Meals were excellent. Very pleased with the flight overall, despite being in economy.

### "would fly with them again"
Sydney to Perth return with Virgin Australia and both flights were direct daytime flights. No delays and efficient friendly crew. One meal served each way with choice of beer wine etc. The leg room is a bit tight but entertainment options were OK and the flights went smoothly. Rest rooms were kept clean. We got very reasonable flight costs for a full service airline and would fly with them again.

### "an enjoyable flight"
I flew Sydney to Bali and return in February with Virgin Australia and decided to go business class, a first time experience. I loved the express pass through customs and the Air New Zealand lounge in Sydney with all the comforts. The only disappointment was having to get on a bus to get to the aircraft. Upon boarding the crew were fantastic, learning our names, offering drinks/news papers etc. The food on the way over was the best I've had on a flight. The flight attendant in our cabin was polite and welcoming. For the way home, the crew were good but not as memorable as on the way over. The level of service I didn't feel matched the way over and I don't think this is due to the crew. I think it's more to do with the rather poor lounge service at Bali airport (not run by VA), timing of the flight, the meals provided and amenities, etc were very much reduced compared to the way over. Seats were comfortable with lots of leg room however they could have a better recline and the inflight entertainment needs newer programs/movies. All in all an enjoyable flight and would do again.

### "charge for soda or orange juice"
Virgin Australia from Cairns to Queenstown via Brisbane. The short flight from Cairns to Brisbane was enjoyable. A muffin and drinks were served. The next flight was considered an international flight - Australia to New Zealand. There was no meal served - unless paid for. There was even a charge for soda or orange juice. The crew was rude and lazy. The only time we saw them was when drinks were served (once during the flight). They spent a lot of the flight on personal calls. There was no entertainment.

### "avoid flights with them in future"
Flight from Proserpine to Brisbane moved from 9:00am to 15:50pm! This means we will miss our connecting Qantas flight. We also have a hotel booking in Sydney which we would now have to try and change. So I phoned Virgin Australia to see what we can do and was told we can get our flight refunded or changed to another "same cost" flight? I was also told that I should have taken travel insurance to cover things like this. That says a lot about the Virgin Australia commitment to your customers. I inquired why the flight was changed and was told due to "operational requirements"? So what they are basically telling me is I must pay extra because they are trying to save money? I phoned Qantas and they helped me move our connecting flight and waived the service fee! Enough said about what Virgin Australia think about their customers. So all in all I am very disappointed with how they just push the envelope. For what it is worth I will avoid personal and business flights with them in future.

### "they would not refund us"
We recently booked our honeymoon for April 2016 to Vanuatu flying with Virgin Australia. A couple of weeks after we booked it we heard about the closer of the airport in Vanuatu due to safety concerns and that Virgin have suspended all flights. We rang them as soon as we found out, this over a month ago now, to find out if our honeymoon would be affected. They assured us that everything would be fine by April and it would not affect us. Not feeling convinced we rang again a couple of weeks later and asked if we could get a refund so we could rebook our honeymoon before it was to late, as we had seen in the newspaper that the airport in Vanuatu would be closed until April. When we rang the second time they said they would not refund us as everything will be back to normal by our departure date on the 11th April. Today we have revived an email saying our entire honeymoon has been cancelled due to the airport problems. We understood that this is not Virgin Australia fault. We then rang and asked how long until we receive the refund on our flights so we can use it to rebook another honeymoon ASAP as it is only 1 month untill our wedding. Virgin said the soonest we will be able to get a refund is in 8-12 weeks! We spent an hour and a half on the phone with them trying to explane we can't have a honeymoon anymore if our money is tied up with them as we have no money now to rebook another honeymoon. They had no concern and after spending so long in the phone with them we got nowhere!

### "seats with very little leg room"
Virgin Australia seems to operate multiple levels of service depending on which route you fly, if you fly a so called 'leisure or holiday' route you get a high density 737 packed with seats with very little leg room. I'm 6'2" but on Jetstar I have enough room to sit but on Virgin Australia my knees were pointed towards the ground, and Virgin believe they are a premium carrier - I don't think so!

### "seats were comfortable"
Adelaide to Bali. A good flight, with helpful staff. On the return flight we had to go via Melbourne due to factors beyond Virgin's control. But we were put into a Airport Hotel, along with 30 others, and on the first connecting flight in the morning. The seats were comfortable as was the inflight free entertainment. Only minor issue, lack of toilets as just two at the back for tourist class which led to delays

### "very pleasant experience"
Brisbane to Adelaide return. Both flights were pleasant. Things are slightly better with Virgin Australia now that they are a full-service airline, although some food and beverage items remain non-complimentary. The cabin crew were attentive, friendly and smiling. The seat was more spacious than expected, and certainly more spacious than most long-haul international flights I've been on. I love the IFE that is freely accessible using the WiFi system onboard as long as one has the app installed on their hand-held devices - this is not available on domestic flights of other Australian airlines. The selection was sufficiently extensive, and excellent for short-haul flights. The complimentary snacks came in rather small portion, but were delicious. My return after-working-hours flight from ADL comes with complimentary alcoholic beverages, which is a huge plus. Overall a very pleasant experience, great value for money.

### "felt very uncomfortable"
Can't fault the food or the service with Virgin Australia, but was given emergency seats 14A and 14B. Felt very uncomfortable about the fact that the passenger sitting next to us in 14C was constantly drinking small bottles of wine. My husband counted approximately 6 bottles that were served to him. It didn't seem right to be given that much alcohol during a flight, especially being in an emergency seat and that it was only a 3 and a half hour flight from Denpasar to Perth. It seemed different staff were serving him so they probably wouldn't have realised how much he had.

### "cabin was freezing"
Flew Virgin Australia from Auckland to Denpasar via Adelaide. The first stage to Adelaide was fantastic but that was on an Air New Zealand Plane (codeshare agreement). All downhill after that. The cabin was freezing and they don't supply blankets or pillows. No onboard entertainment you are meant to download an App, which on our tablets we couldn't get sound. The only toilets available are at the back of the plane, at one stage the queue was 10 people going down the aisle, felt sorry for the people in the aisle seats as they kept getting bumped as people tried to squeeze past the queue to get back to their seats. I will never fly or recommend them again, I have also been told that if you book through Air NZ you still end up on a Virgin plane through the code share system, I would be seriously let down if that was the case.

### "one of the worst flights"
We were travelling from Johannesburg to Sydney via Perth, Johannesburg to Perth with South African Airways was an extremely pleasant flight - however from Perth to Sydney via Melbourne with Virgin Australia was one of the worst flights I have ever experienced. Flight delayed in Perth so we were eventually placed on another flight via Melbourne - total delay 10 hours, however that I can live with, not a problem - my concern was the ground staff they were very poor in communication and did not know what was going more interested in talking between themselves and handing out food vouchers. I guess whilst the passengers are eating they can't ask questions. They evertually placed us on a flight via Melbourne although there was a direct flight going to Sydney departing 10min later We were informed that there were no business class seats on the direct flight and all business class passengers would be on our flight via Melbourne that was not correct we were the only Business Class passengers from the previous flight. We waited in the Business Class lounge very disappointed a very poor selection of food. Business class service on both flights was not noticeable, why did we bother paying the extra. We were under the impression that Virgin were trying to attract Business Class passengers - they are oviously using a new approach, not sure that it will work. We complained to Virgin and they offered points, that to us is offensive and a waste as it is not my intention to fly Virgin again with out an acceptable explanation. Airlines should he held accountable as it is not always possible to select the airline you prefer as on many occasions - there is only one airline servicing a particular location.

### "recommend their service"
Hobart to Sydney via Melbourne with Virgin Australia, and great service and friendliness. The flight departed Hobart early and landed ahead of schedule in MEL. MEL-SYD was fully booked (early morning on a Monday), crew were extremely friendly and efficient on this short sector. I never understand why some economy passengers demand the world on a one hour flight! I enjoy Virgin Australia and recommend their service.

### "did not load my bags"
Gold Coast to Sydney with Virgin Australia. My initial flight was cancelled as the plane needed to be used for an earlier flight that had been cancelled. Therefore putting me on a later flight. This caused issues as I had an international connecting flight which I was now going to miss. After managing to get onto an earlier Virgin Australia flight and having 1hr 30min to make the international flight, they did not load my bags onto the flight and could not locate them in time, resulting in me missing my international flight. Had they loaded the bags, made me aware that they were not onboard or checked them through to London (my final destination), I would have made the international flight. Ground staff at the Gold Coast airport were extremely unhelpful and dismissive saying that as my international flight was not a partner airline they could not assist with my queries or concerns.

### "wouldn't pay full price "
Successful bid for an upgrade from economy class. Sydney to Gold Coast is only a 1h 20min flight, and my bid was AUD 170 above economy, so was it worth it? I don't belong to a scheme which gives me lounge access, so this was a plus, and the Virgin business lounge at Sydney was clean, large, and well laid out with lots of workstations. One problem was the wifi, which, despite getting the password from reception, I couldn't get to work on either of my devices. At the gate, priority boarding had me stuck in a queue for 5 mins, before I could get to my seat (1d). Plenty of leg room, comfortable, older-style leather seat. No drink before take-off. Cabin crew very friendly. The supervisor was looking after business class, and did a very good job. Drinks, including a choice of wine and beers were served. There was no choice of meal (a very short flight and only 8 business class passengers), and it was asian prawn noodle salad or just economy-style snacks. The salad was tasty, but a nightmare to try and eat without getting it all over myself! Shredded salad and soft noodles do tend to fall all over the place! My wine was a very pleasant tempranillo blend and it hit the spot from my point of view. Entertainment is basically bring your own or make sure you've downloaded their app before you get on board, because you can't download it when you're on the plane. No other entertainment provided. Being at the front did give me priority deplaning on arrival. Was it all worth the extra AUD 170? Yes, but could do better. A glass of wine before take-off, a choice of meals which have a better ability to stay on a fork, and perhaps some entertainment to make up for me not being psychic enough to download their app, maybe! Would bid again for the upgrade. Wouldn't pay full price though!

### "crew were great"
Business class with Virgin Australia from Sydney to Perth. The new seat is really cool. For individual window seat is best and for couple the middle seats are best as the the seat configuration is 1-2-1 and there is a partition between the middle seats which can be lower if needed. The crew on my flight were great. A 3 course lunch was served for my flight with good selection of drinks. If you want to catch up with sleep, there is also an Express menu.

### "cheap fare - big mistake"
We chose Virgin Australia only because of the cheap fare it offered between Sydney and Auckland - big mistake. The flight was delayed 45 minutes because of a problem with one of toilets, which ended up being closed for the whole flight. Once we took off, there was no drinks service until 1.5 hours into the flight. When the dinner service began they served us pasta which was cold. I tried to get the staff to heat it, but they just shrugged and said the oven wasn't working. After this, I would rather pay more for Qantas tickets.

### "crew members had forced smiles"
Adelaide to Melbourne with Vigin Australia on a morning flight. Check in was very quick and easy. Check in staff member looked miserable and forced a smile after saying to her have a nice day. Flight was on time. Apparently the incoming Melbourne to Adelaide flight there was turbulence so no tea or coffee was served on the flight back to Melbourne. The seat belt sign was turned off after reaching altitude for the duration of the flight. The crew members were too busy at the rear of the plane talking. They finally got up 15 minutes into the flight and handed out breakfast bars and water or Orange juice. They weren't very friendly and again they had forced smiles on their faces. The seat belt sign came back on for landing so I am really not sure if they could be bothered serving tea and coffee. Their Orange juice was very bitter and the breakfast bar was quite disgusting. Only good thing about the flight the boarding was smooth and the flight was on time. If you are looking for an airline with friendly staff don't bother with Virgin Australia.

### "utter waste of money"
Adelaide to Phuket via Perth, and Virgin Australia business class was a complete and utter waste of money. They have no understanding of what the level of service for business class should be. This is no reflection on the staff who we found to be friendly and a pleasure to deal with. There was no priority baggage, no table cloths, no warm towels, poor inflight entertainment (tatty samsung tablet anyone?) no restriction on economy passengers using the business bathroom. In fact aside from a slightly (and I do mean slightly) bigger seat and access to the lounge there was no advantage in having a business class ticket.

### "nice little aircraft with good legroom"
I flew with Virgin Australia from Coffs Harbour to Sydney, the E190 is a nice little aircraft with good legroom, had an empty seat next to me which was nice. The crew very OK, but looked very tired. A biscuit and a choice of juice or water was offered, also 23 kg of luggage was included in the fare which is great. One thing I did notice is when the captain asked the crew to be seated for landing the cabin crew at the rear of the aircraft left their crew bags on the seats and not secured. Overall pleasant enough for a 40 minute flight.

### "pleasant and enjoyable"
Hobart to Sydney via Melbourne with Virgin Australia, and the flights were pleasant and enjoyable, and staff helpful and smiling. Inflight snacks leave a little to be desired, but on short flights (1:15 and 1:30), does anything need to be served? Cabin crew handled a full MEL/SYD flight efficiently. I look forward to flying with them again.

### "had expected a meal"
Brisbane to Melbourne and a pleasant flight but nothing special. First time in business class on Virgin Australia. Flight was at 10.00am and after allowing for daylight saving a 1.15pm arrival into Melbourne. Food offered was only a snack service. Given the time of arrival I had expected a meal service. No alcoholic drinks offered. I paid for the flight with points. Had I paid for the flight would have been disappointed with what was offered.

### "upgraded to an exit row"
Adelaide to Sydney return with Virgin Australia. At check-in I was upgraded to an exit row, much to my pleasure. The flight was wonderful, with tea, coffee, water and juice served with a muffin. The crew were an absolute delight. The return flight was a breeze, although this time I received exit row seats only after asking. After almost half an hour in the queue of security / baggage check (almost a norm at Sydney's T2), it was a relief to get on the plane. Onboard the were attentive, although more robotic than on the outbound flight. Cheese and crackers served with refreshments. In terms of entertainment, the Virgin Australia app provides video/audio entertainment that can be streamed directly to a smartphone. Although the options were a little limited, it was a great way to fill the 1hr 40min flight there and back. Overall, Virgin Australia provide a service that is beyond my expectations.

### "appreciated E190 2x2 seating"
A smooth and pleasant flight from Sydney to Melbourne. It was a surprise to get the smaller E190 plane on this route, and I appreciated the 2x2 seating and the greater legroom compared with the Boeing 737. Online check-in, bag drop and boarding were all professional, and the friendly cabin crew served cheese and biscuits as well as drinks. The flight operated slightly ahead of schedule.

### "limited comfort in sleeping"
I flew Virgin Australia business class from Denpasar to Sydney. The 0010 departure time wasn't the best but typical of red-eye return flights. The lounge was an improvement in the new terminal but the Boeing 737-800 aircraft is not as comfortable as its competitors for a night flight. Limited recline meant limited comfort in sleeping. The headrests compensated in the aisle seat and I did manage a doze but little else. The food options were somewhat limited. Crew were friendly and attentive.

### "on-time and comfortable"
Brisbane to Auckland, returning Wellington to Brisbane on Virgin Australia Boeing 737-800. Really enjoyed both flights which were on-time and comfortable. I was unsure of the type of fare I had paid for, however I was pleasantly surprised to receive a meal including a choice of breakfast and lunch. Food generally good except for the breakfast frittata. Inflight entertainment is via the Virgin App which worked fine on my iPad and had a good selection of movies/music etc. FA's were nice enough and did their job. Overall, I would not hesitate to fly with Virgin again but the product is slightly less of that of Qantas.

### "wireless entertainment service"
Port Moresby to Bali via Brisbane on Virgin Australia. Check in was smooth in Port Moresby. The service on the flight to Brisbane was just snack and non alcohol drinks. Cabin crew was friendly and professional. From Brisbane to Denpasar the meal choice is vegetarian pasta or beef and rice, main course was delicious and bread was good. The cabin crew were not too careful because one cabin crew throw some water in the my trouser and just said "Sorry, I will give you a blanker". For both flights the inflight entertainment need passenger personal devices and use the wireless entertainment service, but you have to install on your personal devices Virgin Australia Entertainment before the flight.

### "experience was horrible"
Denpasar to Sydney. As a hitherto loyal Virgin Australia customer (Platinum ff), the experience flying with them to and from Bali was horrible. The flight is actually over 6 hours - not what any other full service airline would call 'short haul', especially in the middle of the night - no service, no food except purchased pringles etc and no passenger amenities (no pillows, blankets) for a 6 hour night flight. The aircraft was dirty, the seats uncomfortable and the crew unhappy to be doing their jobs. If flying to/from Bali from Australia, do yourself a favour - even with a stop, SIA and Garuda are better options.

### "very friendly and helpful"
Virgin Australia from Melbourne to Perth, and the flight was fine. Seat was ok, Food was good and Flight attendants were very friendly and helpful. My only complaint was that my seat had a misaligned window and it was very hard to keep my camera straight when I was filming. Overall a nice flight and good value for money, would recommend.

### "no meal service provided"
Adelaide to Cairns via Brisbane on Christmas day with Virgin Australia. The E90 aircraft to Brisbane was very comfortable having 2 x 2 seating. Both flights on time, and the crew on both flights very efficient and interactive with passengers. Being Christmas Day it was disappointing that no meal service was provided, other than a miniscule christmas pudding, though we were able to grab a snack between flights at Brisbane.

### "cancel the flight"
Gold Coast to Auckland with Virgin Australia. Waited 10 hours at small Coolangata airport. Close to midnight with 2 small boys in tow, the airline decided to cancel the flight. We were given a voucher which bought us a muffin and water. They loaded us on a bus that drove 90 minutes to accomodation. Too exhausted with kids to eat, we tried but couldn't sleep, so remained in the room for 3 hours until at 4am, when we had to load up and drive back to airport. No breakfast was given either. Kids and us were dead on our feet. Eventually got on a flight - was there food for the kids? Not a hope! The airline told us to buy it! I did complain twice and was told they pride themselves on their timely departures and as a gesture would give me some air points - equivalent to $25!

### "cabin crew friendly"
We recently flew Brisbane to Los Angeles with Virgin Australia. The kids were entertained for hours with the options in the inflight entertainment system, cabin crew were friendly and accomodating and even after a travel agent stuff up that meant 1 member of our party wasn't seated with us they found a way to make it work so we were seated together - even on a full flight. The food was better quality than I have had in recent years,  cabin seemed more up to date and roomier than Qantas A330 I travelled last year to Hong Kong. There was sufficient choice of movies, TV and music. The cabin crew were helpful and quite cheery. Some of the crew were the same going to LAX as coming home and it was nice to see consistency with service. All in all a pleasant experience and I won't hesitate to book with Virgin Australia for my next flight.

### "put on the aircraft first"
Darwin to Sydney with Virgin Australia. My mother who is 91 travelled with me on 21st December. The friendly check in staff moved our seat booking closer to the front of the aircraft making easier access for my Mother. We were asked if we needed a wheelchair in Darwin but declined as only short walk. I had booked wheelchair at Sydney airport. We're put on the aircraft first and the air hostesses allowed Mum to use the business class toilet and the wheel hair was waiting in Sydney.

### "would fly them again"
Smooth boarding and on time departure for a red-eye Virgin Australia flight Perth to Sydney. 2x2 seating in business class with wider seats and minimal recline. The aircraft was showing its age with a run-down interior and lavatories. We were offered a light meal of soup and rolls after departure. My soup was barely warm and had to be reheated. FA's were friendly and efficient with their service. I used the tablet given out for IFE which had a limited selection of movies, TV shows and music. Prior to arrival, we were offered a light breakfast with coffee and juice. We arrived on time and those of us connecting to international flights were offered an airside bus transfer to the international terminal. This was much appreciated as Sydney airport tends to be crowded in the early hours of the day. Whilst the experience was quite ordinary, I would fly with them again.

### "worst customer service "
Gold Coast to Melbourne. Worst customer service I have ever experienced. Virgin Australia managed to lose my bags twice on the same trip. Once one way and on the way back. The staff at Virgin we so rude, they made out as if it was my fault they did not load the bags. The staff, the service was the worst I have ever experienced.

### "my favourite airline"
Flight attendants were very attentive. Food was tasty, and I love the Boeing Sky Interior. Seats were comfortable enough, and the bar was good for making sure I moved around a bit. Cabin crew were really engaging. The only things that were annoying were having to get the bus to the terminal and the windowless lounge in Abu Dhabi. My favourite airline.

### "never travel with them again"
My husband and I had Virgin Australia economy seat tickets to Sydney (from Christchurch NZ) with Virgin Australia on November 10. Tickets were purchased through Travelocity (saver fare) and we found out as we were checking in that baggage check was not included. The airline agent charged us $130 (NZ $) for my bag and we were told my husband would also have to check his "carry-on" (21 in.) size bag. This cost us another $130. The final insult was seeing many people at the boarding gate with bags the same size (or larger) than my husband's bag who were allowed to carry their bags on board. Despite 2 letters to customer service, nothing has been done. Would never travel with them again, because of inconsistent practices by airline agents and very high baggage check prices.

### "Safety procedure good"
Bali to Port Moresby via Brisbane. Denpasar check in was smooth and helpful, boarding was bad because no air bridge and a bus to board to aircraft far away from gate. Seat was comfortable with wireless entertainment of Virgin Australia (I need to bring my personal devices to get entertainment onboard) . Cabin crew was friendly for DPS to BNE Flight. Food good with chicken or vegetable pasta. Safety procedure good and really strict from start boarding until end. BNE to POM boarding was smooth and good, but not for the cabin crew from BNE to POM. One of cabin crew told me before the flight "Do not bring too much cabin baggage again on next flight" - in my baggage is pillow and blanket I bring because no blanket and pillow in all of Virgin Australia for any of these flights. Snack service and Buy on Board was good. Landing safely in Port Moresby Jackson International Airport.

### "smallest, narrowest, most miserable seats"
Virgin Australia and high expectations-Surprise. Flew Virgin Australia flight 120 from Brisbane to Dunedin, on 19/11/2015. Been looking forward to it for weeks. However, the unfriendly and irritable check-in agent changed our already-booked seat numbers (which we had chosen with some consideration) without even telling us. I was shocked that my friend had to pay over $100AUD to have his single 6 kg bag checked. Then we scrunched in for three hours in the smallest, narrowest, most miserable airline seats. Finally, the flight attendant got all defensive and huffy when I tactfully pointed out an adult passenger ignoring the fasten seatbelt during heavy turbulence. His seatbelt was hanging into the aisle. Basically, she implied it shouldn't be my concern and she didn't say a word to the unbelted passenger. My first experience with Virgin won't be my last-I'm already booked for two more flights. Please tell me that my 15-hour Virgin Australia flight from BNE to LAX in a few days will not be as miserable as my first.

### "New A330 cabin comfortable"
Brisbane to Perth. New A330 cabin, comfortable, looks good and generally well equipped. Crew explained the new features very well. Drink handed just before take off so only a couple of sips before it needed to be removed. Service slow in the air, was a bit of turbulence that limited crew a tad but while pleasant they were generally not engaged. Not offered wine during with entree, had to ask for a wine with the main and again with cheese. Food was OK, went to sleep, comfort of bed adequate but despite the promise of memory foam, I thought the previous seat was just as comfortable. For a domestic service the flight was good but not great. Dinner flight where the food may have dried out a little when could not be served during brief period of turbulence. Wine reasonable but needed to be requested. Most of the crew were going through the motions and apart from a couple of staff, appeared tired.

### "flight was fine"
Brisbane to Canberra with Virgin Australia. Pleasant enough crew member, I was the only passenger in the Business cabin for this breakfast flight. Fruit salad with hard melon, coffee OK. Had no bag so walked straight into the new Brisbane lounge, an improvement on going through the terminal. Lounge bigger but basically the same as previously. Flight on time. In all flight was fine.

### "delay problem in BNE"
My schedule is to fly from Port Moresby to Bali via Brisbane with Virgin Australia. Due the delay on the arrival of the inbound flight to Port Moresby, I did not have any enough time to connect to Bali in BNE Airport. Ground Handling was not friendly when I complained about that, there is no Virgin Australia Staff in charge in Port Moresby Airport. Finally I get 1 night voucher in airport hotel in Port Moresby paid by Virgin Australia. The next day I flew with Virgin Australia - POM to BNE had the snack service and non alcohol service drink provided on this flight. Brisbane  to Bali provided a full meal and all kind of drink -1 Vegetarian Menu and 1 Beef Rice Menu. The food was good and cabin crew was friendly and helpful. But when I ask about my delay problem in BNE Airport, the ground staff cannot give me any solution and just say sorry.

### "very satisfactory flight"
Good check in (after 10 weeks traveling, I was slightly overweight and this was not a problem for the staff member who checked me in). Flight took off on time and landed almost 10 minutes early. Luggage was off quickly. The flight was smooth and minimal refreshments offered (in reality it was a 50 minute flight). Cabin announcements kept to a minimum. All in all a very satisfactory flight at the end of a series of long flights.

### "not a full service airline"
I was all for them quite a while ago when they considered themselves a budget airline. Now they advertise as a full service airline, which they are not. A three hour lunchtime flight each way and only small snacks - ie. mini muffin, one mint, dried banana chips were given, the other flight a tiny ribbon plain sandwich. There wasn't even any half way decent food to buy! Free entertainment, what a joke, there were various devices to be brought onboard, none we were able to load the app. It was a lot of messing around, not worth it in the end. So if you are happy to sit hungry for hours with no entertainment whatsoever, after paying for a full service airline, go for it - otherwise stick with Qantas.

### "attendants were observant"
Abu Dhabi to Sydney with Virgin Australia. Meals were tasty and well presented - breakfast one of the best I've had onboard a flight. The attendants were observant and pro-active, offering drinks/snacks in between the two main services. Bar area was a nice area to stretch your legs. While the seats were a little tired and lacks the bells and whistles of other airlines, the service offered by the crew and great aussie wines are a winner.

### "bring your own food and water"
Flew Virgin Australia for the first time SYD-LAX-SYD due to discounted fares so was aware that I was not paying for the same product as Qantas. For a 13 to 14 hour flight the Red entertainment system is okay but nothing special. Seats nice and roomy but so hard underneath they are about as comfortable as sitting on a park bench. The cabin on both flights was unbearably hot with no ability to control your own air vents so expect a warm and sweaty flight. The staff are very friendly but not at all attentive and disappear for most of the flight leaving passengers to "self serve" chips and water from the snack bar. This is fine if you are in an aisle seat but useless for anyone else unless you want to keep waking up the passengers seated next to you. The cost cutting is most apparent in the food. I am pretty forgiving of airline food generally but Virgin Australia long haul is not generous with food and drink service and when meals are served they consist of mismatched menu items (like a chicken salad starter for a beef main) and other oddities like a dry microwaved omelette in a sealed cardboard box that simply cannot be described as edible or even as food. Not only that but on the SYD-LAX leg the dry omelette was served twice! Hungry is the word I would most associate with these flights. Bring your own food and water, an extra pillow for the seat, dress for the desert and don't expect to see any cabin crew for most of your flight and you too can spend 14 hours calculating whether the money saved on the fare was worth it.

### "cabin crew nice and polite"
Cabin crew on this Virgin Australia flight were very nice and polite. This trip was around 2 hours and 20 mins, they offered free drink and snack, and when I asked them had a extra drink, they was happy to serve this. The inflight entertainment needs to improve as they are not enough movies and don't update, but the WIFI connect was quite good . I wish I could go to other website, not only Virgin entertain phone APP, it will be more better. The cabin is new and seats are leather so it is comfortable.

### "worst business class I have flown"
Virgin Australia from Perth to Denpasar, and business class seats are not comfortable. Very little recline and very poor for an international business class cabin. Food and beverage is very average, as is the cabin crew service. Standard of inflight entertainment very poor, with poor content and use of mini iPad. Almost a con to call this a business class, never again! Seriously, it is the worst business class I have flown anywhere, at a price that is above most competitors.

### "a good flight, would do it again"
Normally fly Qantas however as they don't fly Melbourne to Gold Coast (without stopping in SYD or going to BNE) thought we'd try Virgin Australia. Did the online check in without any trouble on the website and bag drop was equally hassle free (23kg included checked baggage is quite generous for domestic). Flight from MEL delayed slightly due to some low lying fog but the flight made up time in the air. The inflight entertainment was streamed to your own device via wifi and content was limited, however there was more than sufficient for the short haul flight. Inflight snack was a pretty small muffin but a nice touch anyway. Didn't use the toilet so can't comment on that. Smooth landing to the south gave a view of the Pacific and Surfers Paradise. Didn't take long to get off and begin the holiday! Flight back was similar however snack was a tiny sandwich and it was an older aircraft (ex-pacific blue). All up a good flight would do it again if price was less than Qantas.

### "discomfort of the small seats"
I flew from Bali to Brisbane with Virgin Australia in Economy class on Boeing 737. I had to sit in a window seat economy with two large blokes on my outside, who immediately slept the entire 5 hour flight. Going to the toilet was impossible. The service was very mixed, from a very jovial cabin steward, to a rather grumpy unfriendly ageing stewardess. The food was pretty good, as is the inflight wifi entertainment. The discomfort of the small seats on a small plane will make me review my carrier for this frequent trip.

### "the seat is decidedly uncomfortable"
Outbound Virgin Australia flight to Apia departed an hour late (22.00), even though all passengers were on board by 21.00. Many passengers boarded with ludicrously large pieces of hand luggage, and it came as no surprise when the Captain announced that passengers had to be offloaded because the aircraft's maximum take-off weight had been exceeded. Hand luggage is a real issue on the Pacific Islands flights, according to the lead flight attendant. Surely Virgin Australia could prevent this by checking hand luggage weights at check-in? Seats 1A and 1C were fine. Not super comfortable for a premium product, and the amount of recline is really quite poor. Also, after 5 hours of flying, the seat is decidedly uncomfortable. Legroom in row 1 is average too, with the bulkhead directly in front of you. Flew the return leg in Economy and paid for the exit row seats. Far more comfortable there than in the premium seats! The food on the outbound leg was very good, and the cabin service excellent. The Virgin Australia premium seats are fine for short-haul, bot on 4+ hour flights they really aren't up to scratch. Save your money and book an exit row economy seat if it's legroom you require.

### "crew were friendly and helpful"
Los Angeles to Sydney with Virgin Australia, and cabin crew were friendly and helpful. The food was incredible and beautifully presented. The seat lays flat, but there isn't much privacy between the seats unlike British Airways or Japan Airlines. The memory foam mattress that they put on the seat to sleep makes it comfy.

### "enjoyable early morning flight"
Virgin Australia, Boeing 737-800 from Melbourne to Sydney. Half-empty flight, got a whole row to myself. My seat was quite comfortable. Cabin staff were courteous and friendly. Flight departed MEL a little late but arrived in SYD early. I enjoyed the coffee that was served on-board - also given a muffin that tasted bland and cakey. Overall it was an enjoyable early morning flight.

### "I was expecting a little more"
I connected after an Air Serbia flight to Virgin Australia from Abu Dhabi to Sydney on August 31st. The flight seemed to take quite a while to load passengers, it was certainly after the boarding time scheduled, but they made up time with a quick taxi/reduced flight time. Apparently the Australian government requires a second bag check within the departure lounge for liquids etc, which slows the entire process down and looks quite inefficient. Announcements from captain and air crew ok, however no menu handed out so another member of cabin staff struggled through menu with many mispronounced words, seemed unprofessional. Food otherwise ok, I was expecting a little more, particularly after recent Emirates and Qantas flights. Overall, I had the impression that this product is from yesteryear, nothing has really changed since they bought these planes back in 2009, as V Australia. IFE seems slow and outdated, cabin cleanliness was ok. Service was fun and cheerful. Compared to a Virgin A330 I took Perth to Sydney in 2014, this service felt like a regular domestic flight. I hear they are taking these planes out of service later this year to retrofit some of the classes.

### Virgin Australia customer review
Only complaint - long waits at bag drop. But did get bumped up queue as check in was about to close. Being annoyed waiting was forgotten about when attendant gave upgrade to emergeny exit row with extra leg room which was great for someone 6'4. Aircraft was good to travel on and coffee and muffin reasonable for an hours flight.

### Virgin Australia customer review
Have just completed a couple of flights with VA domestic and again found they were excellent in all areas. Seated in front row of Business and promptly offered a juice or water and prior to take-off informed of the menu for breakfast or lunch. Entertainment system offered though I have the Virgin Inflight system installed on my Ipad. Food is always very good and service is most attentive. I have said before the crew always seem to enjoy their job and offer to refresh water and offer newspapers etc. Planes are always clean and their prompt departure times always amazes me for such a big airline. Many fellow passengers I have spoken with during flights in recent times are now confirmed VA travellers.

### Virgin Australia customer review
The flight was a nice short trip, only 35 mins. The crew were lovely and the flight was smooth. My only gripe was the tea and coffee was out of order as there was a malfunction and the toilet was very very small. Overall a great flight for the time you are in the air.

### Virgin Australia customer review
I bought a ticket to fly from Sydney to Frankfurt via Abu Dhabi with Air Berlin. The first leg from Sydney to Abu Dhabi was operated by Virgin Australia. I have flown overseas multiple times with other airlines, a couple of times to Germany too. All of them gave me the option to increase my baggage limit by paying extra before the flight (you get charged a lot more per kg on the day at the airport otherwise). Virgin Australia tells me that I do not have the option to do that. Even budget airlines gave me the option increase baggage limit up to 50kg. In the light of Virgin's rather positive reputation, I think this is highly unsatisfactory and they certainly do not live up to their reputation. (For goodness sake, I was even willing to pay extra to increase the limit; I was not asking for a freebie. They are hopeless.) I was also disgusted by Virgin and AirBerlin trying to "pass the ball" between themselves for an eternity, not taking any responsibility or care. It is just poor customer service, poor work ethics. Some staff over the phone were also rude and impatient, but let's not even go there. Never am I going to have anything to do with Virgin again.

### Virgin Australia customer review
I booked via Etihad and the LHR to Abu Dhabi was operated by Etihad but the next leg (near 15 hrs) was operated by Virgin Australia. Entertainment was very poor. Screens were old, very limited choice on all counts, film, TV, radio, audiobooks. The seats were uncomfortable (even more then they usually are on a 15 hr plane journey). I dont think the bathrooms got a clean throughout the flight and the impact on cleanliness was severe. I have flown some budget airlines so this means I am fairly easily pleased and my expectations are low. I wasnt pleased with this flight and experience. To make it worse, it also means I'll avoid booking Etihad because I would be concerned about getting stuck with Virgin.

### Virgin Australia customer review
I was very disappointed by Virgin Australia's performance a few days ago. During the course of the afternoon many flights from Sydney were being canceled without any explanation being provided to customers. When I arrived at the airport in Sydney yet more flights (to Melbourne) were cancelled and my own flight disappeared from the departure board! There was no explanation for this or for the cancelations during the day. Or rather, talking to many frustrated passengers, it seems that Virgin had given no fewer than 5 different explanations ranging from 'bad weather' (not true as we checked most of the Australian cities), mechanical problems, change of equipment (but again no explanation provided), 'just don't know' (statement made by reservation staff to several passengers) and so on. We understand that problems occur at all airlines from time to time but the real test of a good airlines is its commitment to keep customers informed and on a regular basis, whenever problems arise. On this occasion, Virgin's performance was abysmally poor. My flight eventually left Sydney 45 minutes late. I was lucky as all around me at the Sydney airport dozens of irate passengers were being told that they wouldn't be able to fly until the next day. Again, no explanation.

### Virgin Australia customer review
Check in at Brisbane was poor, machines didn’t work and there seemed to be a shortage of staff though when I finally reached the counter the young lady was polite and helpful. Actual flight was good except the cabin was freezing really needed that blanket. I was involved as a helper in a medical emergency and was impressed with the care and attention given by the crew. Found the shell like seats a little hard.

### Virgin Australia customer review
We bought the tickets during a Virgin sale, so got a good price. Virgin offers service equal to Qantas, often at a lower price. Adelaide-Sydney we were offered coffee/tea and a sandwich. We had packed some salad, so time passed quickly. We used the Virgin entertainment app on tablet which worked perfectly. Arrival on time. Bags delivered quickly.

### Virgin Australia customer review
I was supposed to take the later flight to Melbourne, but due to the weather report when I arrived at the counter, staff suggested me to take the earlier flight, as my original flight may be cancelled. Very nice ground staff. Chick in smooth and quick. The cabin crew was a little bit rude. After take off, a complimentary drink and muffin was served, this flight has in-flight entertainment system by using the smart phone app. Connect to the plane's entertainment wifi, and I could watch movie and listen to music on my smart phone. But the choices were very limited, plus the plane has no charger. The flight arrived Melbourne early, and the baggage claim was quick.

### Virgin Australia customer review
MEL-SYD return and multiple flights. Once again this airline is as good as they come. Flew business class between Melbourne and Wellington recently and was more than impressed with the quality of the food and service. Lounges for Trans-Tasman flights are shared with Air New Zealand which are both very good in Melbourne and Wellington. Recent trips to Sydney and return have also been impressive. Nice apple muffin served and water, juice tea or coffee offered and due to Platinum status seating in row 3 a bonus. The other thing about VA is their turn-around time which is pretty quick. Often seated at Departure gate and watch passengers disembarking and in what seems no time at all you are being boarded for your flight. Staff are always friendly and helpful. Overall an airline that is really striving for excellence.

### Virgin Australia customer review
Four friends and I flew to and from Samoa. Unless absolutely necessary we all with never fly with Virgin again. Pros: The staff were generally friendly. The planes appeared to be fairly new and comfortable. Negatives: There is no inflight entertainment. I do not have an Ipod so I could not linkup to the planes internal computer system, which is what you have to do. No food of any description was provided. Coffee, tea and water was the only thing - not good enough for a 6 hour flight. Food was available for sale. Only one type of sandwich which had nuts, a vegetarian wrap, a meat pie - basically inedible - $10. Juice/cold drinks - I can't remember how much as I didn't buy one due to the outrageous prices. What topped the whole experience off was us having to pay an extra $150 at Samoa airport to get each of our surf boards back. When we left Sydney Virgin accepted our luggage as per our agreement/ticket. That being 1 x carry on luggage, 1 x bag and 1 x sporting equipment. In our case the sporting equipment were surfboards. We were on a surf holiday so I suppose it only makes sense to have surf boards. On our return when we booked in at Samoa airport we were told we had to pay approximately $150 extra to get each board back. We challenged that and was told there had been a change in procedure. Flying with Virgin Australia should have been a good experience. It was not.

### Virgin Australia customer review
BNK-SYD and then SYD-BNE at the end of the day was very good. Half full flights meant that I was able to swap into an exit row on both flights and have heaps of room. No hassles from the staff and service was good for the short one hour hops that these flights are. The WiFi entertainment app though is a little lacking.

### Virgin Australia customer review
VA883 MEL-SYD 21 May and VA866 SYD-MEL 23 May. The B738 aircraft that was originally allocated for VA883 had a major system fault and was deemed unsuitable for flying so we had to disembark and a different aircraft was assigned resulting in a 2-hour delay. The VA ground staff were friendly and very professional tending to our needs and looking after us thoroughly in ensuring that all passengers arrived safely at the replacement gate prior to boarding. The actual MEL-SYD flight was smooth and enjoyable and even though it was a late night flight the FAs offered us complimentary beer and wine to compensate for the delay. VA866 also used a recently-repainted B738 which was very well maintained - the flight departed SYD on time and arrived in MEL early. The FA looking after my section on this leg was particularly helpful and very chatty. Only downside was I got given the exact same refreshment snack on both legs which was a little disappointing. All in all I had a pleasant experience with Virgin Australia would definitely fly with them again.

### Virgin Australia customer review
First TransTasman Business Class flight on Virgin BNE-WLG and return. It was like a good domestic Business Class flight. Check in was fast and pleasant. There are no special meals on VA Business in Australia or international short haul so ate in the Air NZ lounge first (is always either Beef Bourguignon or Thai Chicken Curry) which was OK but lounge was very crowded. Boarding was quick and left on time no bubbly so mineral water or orange juice pre take off. My wife said her meal was one of the best she had ever had on a plane wine was very good service very attentive. Landed a little early and bags off first. Return check in again very smooth WLG lounge was relaxed and reasonable food offerings food on board not as good as coming over but still looked fine - plating was like a restaurant. Crew member very pleasant but no knowledge of wines at all. Arrived early bags off very fast. Given that Air NZ does not do business class to WLG this was much more pleasant than economy. Apart from no special meals or bubbles only other peeve there is no real separation in a 737-800 between cabins and Economy passengers went to the toilet up front and not stopped by the crew - which meant a wait at times.

### Virgin Australia customer review
18/05/15 VA239 MEL-ADL Boeing 737. What a pleasant surprise. I had been reluctant to fly Virgin since my first and last experience with them as Virgin Blue were unsatisfactory. I decided to give them another go. However since re-branding to Virgin Australia what a massive improvement. Very helpful and friendly check-in staff at Tullamarine Airport in Melbourne. Flight Attendants look smart in their new upmarket uniforms. They were also very professional in their mannerism customer service and conduct. They are no longer trying to be funny or humorous. Food and cabin service were excellent. It was such a pleasure to fly with them that I made this comment to the flight attendant upon disembarking the aircraft. The only room for improvement I can say for Virgin Australia would be to become a fully serviced airline. Upon saying that I can't but give them enough praise. I would recommend flying with Virgin Australia and will fly with them again. I can say I am definitely a Virgin Australia convert.

### Virgin Australia customer review
Travelling Melbourne to Auckland. I just purchased the seat and bag option without food or entertainment so didn't expect much. The flight however was delayed for two hours which meant that I was in danger of missing a connecting flight in New Zealand. As a consolation I was given a "meal voucher" which actually was only the equivalent to crackers and cheese and a juice - which is not a meal. Thankfully they left off those who had connecting flights first. It was just as well I'd allowed enough time between flights as I only just caught the connecting flight after barging my way through the customs queue and running from one terminal to the other. Not an experience I want to repeat.

### Virgin Australia customer review
AKL-SYD-DPS-BNE-AKL in Economy. All flights departed on time and were uneventful. The planes were all fairly new and very clean. FA's were attentive and friendly. Food was provided on SYD-DPS-BNE legs and was quite satisfactory. Free drinks were also offered on these flights. Entertainment is available by downloading the Virgin Airline app and using your own devise. My only criticism is that the seats are very very cramped and it is rather claustrophobic. We upgraded to the extra legroom exit row seats which made the overnight return journey bearable. I would choose to fly Virgin on this route again providing the price is right and the connections reasonable.

### Virgin Australia customer review
We booked our flights from Auckland to Townsville in September 2014. Initially we were to fly via Sydney and arrive in Townsville early enough to catch a daytime ferry to Magnetic Island. Virgin Australia changed our itinerary early this year to go via Brisbane and arrive at similar time in Townsville. When we arrived at Auckland airport at 4.30am on 2 May our intended 6.30am flight from Auckland to Brisbane had been cancelled. We were put on an Air NZ flight that departed at approx. 8.30 am that would not reach Brisbane in time to connect with our flight to Townsville. We then waited for 5 hours at Brisbane for the next flight to Townsville. On that flight the seats were too small and the person in front of me reclined their seat making it a most uncomfortable experience. We arrived in Townsville at night. Our flight was the last one into Townsville that night and the ground staff were not there to allow rear exit from the plane. We were stuffed right down the back and by the time we finally got to the baggage claim there was no sign of our single bag. We checked all remaining bags on the conveyor and even consulted the baggage handler who ensured us that all the bags had been placed on the conveyor. We had to get on the shuttle bus to the Magnetic Island Ferry. The reception at our accommodation closed at 5.00pm. If all had gone to plane we would have been there at 3.30pm in daylight. We got to Magnetic Island in the dark at 9.45pm with no suitcase. The next morning we caught the ferry back to Townsville then a taxi to and from the airport and then the ferry back to Magnetic Island - a very expensive and time consuming exercise.

### Virgin Australia customer review
Travelling VA you can see the difference with Qantas. Perth-Brisbane on a cranky old 737 showing its age. You can paint the front but its the insides that count. Midnight flight uneventful. Travelling on a "lunchtime" flight Sunshine coast to Melb. Again a shaky old 737 and no entertainment unless you've downloaded the app on your own tablet. I suppose that's very 21st century but not at all time pleasing if you are unaware and not carrying your tablet. Lunch" was two finger sandwiches. 12.25 departure 2.5 hour flight. Not good enough. The only beverages on offer was water (in a cup not even your own mini bottled water) or a $4 coke zero. So much for all their advertising how they are now all inclusive and full service. If I want to pay for everything from disinterested cabin crew we have Jetstar for that.

### Virgin Australia customer review
I recently flew with VA (Boeing 777) from SYD-AUH return and cannot fault them. Boarding was well managed and timely food was fairly good staff were friendly and attentive. The seats were comfortable and the entertainment was great. On the return leg the flight wasn't very full and the cabin crew encouraged people to spread out and find a row for themselves once airborne (we had to stay in our allocated seats for take off due to weight distribution). Long haul is what you make of it and I figured I had 14 hours to relax watch movies read books have a few wines and a snooze. Something most of us cannot find time for in real life.

### Virgin Australia customer review
Flew Sydney-Brisbane on a busy Sunday. On my occasional previous flights with Virgin I'd noticed that they're inferior to Qantas in every way but not by much. Now that I've flown at a peak time I've seen what cost-cutting at check-in does. There was a queue for the small number of self-check-in kiosks (at least one was broken) then you can't drop your own bag like at Qantas so the queue for the measly 4-5 bag drop counters (they kept closing them due to baggage system problems) stretched to the terminal door. There were 5 proper check-in counters so some people took a punt on those being faster than kiosk + bag drop. 30 minutes to check-in should not be expected for a domestic flight (Qantas will take 5 minutes even at peak times). Given the price difference is usually small I'll avoid Virgin at peak times.

### Virgin Australia customer review
VA160 Brisbane to Auckland. I was keen to try out Virgin's new trans-Tasman business class experience but it was a truly underwhelming experience. It starts with check-in where the VA staff member couldn't find me on the flight as she was typing my surname incorrectly. Much anxiety later I make it to the Air NZ lounge which is far inferior to the QF lounge at BNE International and far inferior to what you would expect for a leading airline's lounge at a key international experience. Not VA's fault. Boarding was not polished. An announcement was made that boarding would commence in the next 10-15 minutes however the incoming aircraft hadn't even arrived! Premium boarding didn't really work either as the economy queue was served at the same time and moved faster than the Premium queue. Not a huge problem but normally premium customers are given the opportunity to board before normal boarding commences. On board is where VA are really let down. No champagne prior to departure - in fact VA do not offer champagne at all on trans-Tasman flights! Only white and red wine which is a real shame. CSM was polite and sweet - but there was no wow factor. She wasn't aware of what cheeses were being offered nor which fruits were on the fruit plate. Offered me Crown lager which was actually a Crown Pale Ale and she didn't know the difference. Didn't know whether the Peroni was a light or heavy beer. Hence asked for a Bloody Mary which is my fall back flying drink and VA do not have Bloody Mary mix or spices. These are really small things but not what you expect in international business class. The meal was served on a tray all together - no place mat nor hot towels were offered.. The main course was only just hot so didn't allow time to have salad first and then dessert was served in a box! The IFE is good. I used the Samsung tablet provided although an announcement was made to say that VA hadn't loaded them in economy for the full fare passengers. I wouldn't want to travel on a VA 737 on a long sector - I really missed having a foot rest or extendable section of the chair to support your lower legs. My message to passengers would be to save your money and points and fly economy across the Tasman. The VA experience is nothing more than a Domestic Business service if that and below that of competitors flying the same route often for cheaper.

### Virgin Australia customer review
I'm a VA Gold FF and recently booked a return flight with virgin Australia from Port Hedland to Bali for mid Feb. 2 weeks before we were due to fly out I noticed a comment regarding changes to the Bali flights on a local social media page. People were informing other passengers that were booked the twice weekly VOA flight from PHE-DEN that the schedule had changed. I then logged on to my FF page to see that VA had automatically put me on a flight out 3 hours prior to originally booked and a return flight back to Port Hedland 25 hours earlier than what was originally booked. I had no phone calls or emails to inform me of the change and had subsequently already booked accommodation for these nights in Bali. I called their customer service on the Monday and was told that they decided to cull one of the weekly return flights from PHE-DEN that its their discretion to make schedule changes when they please. They coldly informed me that my only other option aside from flying out 25 hours early was offer me a different return flight on the original day I was booked to return to Oz however that return flight would take 19 hours and 3 different stops to come back to Hedland instead of 2 hours direct. I fly quite regularly and have never dealt with a airline like VA and I will be avoiding using them going forward.

### Virgin Australia customer review
Flew Adelaide to Denpasar. Overall a good experience and in future I would not hesitate to fly with Virgin Australia again. The cabin crew were polite and friendly food was decent and the free alcoholic drinks was most welcome indeed. My only gripe was there was no entertainment given it was a small plane and 5 hours and 15 minutes is a bit too long to travel without entertainment. Nevertheless compared to Jetstar this airline is impeccable and I would happily pay a premium to fly Virgin over Jetstar in the future.

### Virgin Australia customer review
Flew with VA on BNE-SYD return for work. Similar to my last experience with VA I find the product to be very average and the attitude of the staff below average. As others have noted the cabin crew tend to be very bubbly and friendly to each other (and to other staff who are travelling for duty or pleasure) however turn this off immediately when responding to customers. I would still prefer to fly Qantas on domestic flights.

### Virgin Australia customer review
SYD-LAX-BOS return. All good until a delayed codeshare connecting flight. No ownership of the problem by VA even though whole trip purchased through VA. No attempt to hold the flight for 10 or 12 pax who were 15-30 minutes late no access to luggage and no help with accommodation for the 24 hour wait until the next flight. This all in the middle of the night. VA ground staff literally said that it wasn't their problem and that we needed to talk to Delta. 3 trips back and forth between terminals in the middle of the night and finally found out that VA had our bags (but couldn't give them to us because the guy with the key had gone home until 4pm the next day) and Delta gave us a hotel voucher good until mid-day the next day. I extended the hotel at my own expense so that I wasn't sitting at the airport for another 8 hours in dirty clothes bought myself some food and paid for an internet connection to contact home and make arrangements for someone to look after my kids. VA made no attempt to help and coldly refused to help when asked. I've travelled extensively over many years and delays happen. But I've never seen an airline treat its customers with such contempt and disinterest. They turned a minor annoyance into an ordeal through poor ground crew and poorer linkages with codeshare partners. Aside from that the lounge at LAX (Star Alliance) is excellent the flight crew are friendly and attentive and the onboard food and beverage is good. The seats are comfortable and they do a good job of timing lighting changes and service to allow a good sleep and adjusted arrival both ways.

I flew from the Gold Coast to Sydney yesterday my flight was meant to leave at 10.05 am. First of all it was late by half an hour after that we all boarded the aircraft that as far as it went. About half an hour later sitting on the aircraft they decided that they had some problem with the wiring we all had to go back to the terminal. At first they said it will only take 15 minutes to fix about 1400 hours we were still at the airport at 1420 hours we finally boarded the aircraft then we had to wait another 20 minutes because they realised the aircraft needed refuelling. Because of all that I missed my connecting flight to Hobart which was the only flight left of the day so no one knew if I had to stay overnight in Sydney until I arrive there so they found a flight to Hobart via Melbourne. Never again I will fly with Virgin again.

### Virgin Australia customer review
PER-SYD and return. A330-200. Inflight entertainment was excellent. Food was generally very good although the roast pork on the SYD-PER sector was dry. Cabin crew a bit abrupt on the SYD-PER leg. One thing I found very irritating was the captain announcing the seatbelt sign for turbulence then the cabin crew to only echo the exact same thing again. I've flown this and the BNE sector on the A330-200 a number of times and 8/10 is the lowest score I have given.

OOL-SYD-CBR-OOL in February on B737 and ATR72. Nothing but positives to report. Good lounges at both ends priority boarding reasonable seats for domestic business very good food and excellent service from the cabin crew. Food has improved dramatically and drinks always flow freely. The Virgin cabin crew always amaze me. They do their job with enthusiasm are happy to engage with the passengers are very pro-active with customer service and are totally unpretentious. A pleasure to fly with and my preferred carrier.

Flew Perth-Broome on an E-190. Check in was a disgrace the check in crew could not calculate the weight of my bag and charged me an extra $20 for my baggage (which weighed 14kg) . Boarding was somewhat smooth cabin was crowded. Seats were not comfortable. Service was terrible cabin crew were not friendly nor helpful. For a 2.5 hour flight a small sandwich and water. Charged an extra $2.50 for a small can of soft drink. The landing in Broome was terrible. Will never fly with Virgin Australia again.

### Virgin Australia customer review
Flew Los Angeles to Melbourne via Brisbane. The staff from check-in at LAX all the way to the domestic flight were with one or two exceptions distant and unfriendly. Smiles were few and far between and they seemed to do the absolute minimum required. Annoyingly they are chatty and bubbly when talking among themselves but that disposition is not wasted on customers. Aside from that the legroom is fantastic the best I've had on a long- haul flight. Food was pretty mediocre (a salad without dressing cold bun bland chicken) and there were almost no water or juice runs through the cabin (on a 13-hour flight!). Inflight entertainment was also sub-standard compared to Delta and Qantas. The domestic flight was uneventful and on-time.

### Virgin Australia customer review
Recently flew on VA001 and VA002 SYD-LAX-SYD in premium economy and must say that I was very impressed in the level of inflight service by the attentive crew. Seats were most comfortable and sufficient leg room with the IES being truly amazing and certainly scored a 10 out of 10 from me. The food was very good ex SYD however on the return journey ex LAX it was not so enjoyable. I have travelled this route before many times in the past with Qantas but felt that the service on VA was superior in every way and so much more personalised. First time also on the Boeing 777 and I much prefer this aircraft type than the larger alternative. Cannot wait for the upcoming refurbishment of the VA 777 product with new seats and design.

I recently flew Melb-Cairns return. Found myself getting agitated at Virgins baggage policy. I had two items at a total of 14 kgs one being a 2kg fishing rod. The total allowance by virgin for cattle class is 23kgs. Oh no weight does not matter until you exceed the weight limit Virgin do it by the piece. As a result and $70 later to have a 2kg fishing rod deemed a "piece" of extra luggage left me flabbergasted. Be aware of this should you be considering Virgin as they are totally inflexible on this - it can make a flight a whole lot more expensive.

Sydney to Hobart in January 2015. Check in and boarding went quite smoothly but one we got onto the plane we realised that the three of us traveling had to sit in different seats. I had to sit at the back of the plane while the rest of my family were right at the front. The seats were also a bit cramped. But other than that the aircraft was new and very clean the crew were very friendly and promptly brought anything that you requested. They even asked me if I needed water halfway through the flight. So overall I would definitely recommend Virgin Australia for anyone planning to fly with them in the near future.

Recently flew from Bali to Brisbane and back on Boeing 737-800. Both legs on time and crew were friendly and efficient. The flight was 5.5 hours long and the plane was full on both legs. The biggest drawback is that there are only two toilets at the rear of the aircraft and there seemed to be a permanent queue of people waiting to use them which must have been annoying for anyone seated at the rear of the plane. Be careful when choosing your seats for this flight.

I took V Australia from Melbourne to LAX to NYC in September 2014. The FAs are excellent and the service was first class. Good food IFE and a bar at the back. My only criticism would be the 2x3x2 seat configuration and the fact we had to fly to Sydney for a connecting flight - I am looking forward to the new seats this year.

### Virgin Australia customer review
Flying from Brisbane to Auckland. Very late departure. All very poorly handled by the staff. The flight itself less than average. Old and tired looking plane. No music and no TV screen. Could get a tablet for a fee which was not acceptable as this is not a budget airline. Had far better experience with cheaper airlines like Tigerair and Jetstar. Won't fly with them again.

### Virgin Australia customer review
Flow DPS to MEL in Business considering the price paid I would like to say that this was a very uncomfortable flight. The seats only recline a bit this might be ok for short flights but for flights 6 hours plus it becomes quite uncomfortable hard to sleep they also wake you up about one hour before landing. The breakfast is cereal coffee and juice. The service is acceptable but on a night flight you just want to sleep. Conclusion is the price charged is far to high for the features and benefits you are getting. Tip pay a lot less and fly another airline on A330 in a flatbed. That will be my choice the next time. Sorry Virgin still a while to go. On this occasion I would not recommend Virgin Australia.

### Virgin Australia customer review
SYD-LST. 737-800. Took ages to check in due to very long queues at normal check in bagdrop and self check in kiosks. Adding to the delay was the fact some of the self check in terminals were out of order and there was a gap in staffing due to what appeared to be a shift rotation with ground staff who were running late. Plane was messy with biscuit crumbs greeting me on my entire row of seats. I had a window seat but it seemed very tight particularly where my leg was closest to the wall and likewise the seating pitch was a lot narrower than a smaller A320 from Jetstar. Menu offerings were less appealing than Jetstar too although unlike Jetstar Virgin kindly served complimentary coffee which was much appreciated.

### Virgin Australia customer review
Re Sydney - Queenstown (NZ) flight February 6: Although having had satisfactory experiences with VA in the past I can only hope this flight was an aberration. Just three flight attendants had to cater for a full 737 so service was almost non-existent. A glass of water was only delivered an hour into the trip and many passengers received no meal service at all. There was no in-flight entertainment and even if it had been available no headsets were provided. Our American traveling companions who are used to poor service rated this trip as having the worst service they had ever experienced. We will never fly this airline again if there is an alternative available. We will also be in contact with Virgin for a refund as we paid a premium price ($1361 for 2) for a rock-bottom budget airline experience.

Perth-Sydney. Excellent flight. Usually fly Qantas but no more! Pretty expensive flight but similar if not lower price to Qantas. Brand new A330-200 amazing IFE on par with Emirates/Air NZ. Great crew timing only bad if not minor disappointing aspect was the food. A pink Quiche for one!

I travelled from Sydney to Gold Coast return complementary tea coffee water or juice was available. Very comfortable seats in economy and pretty good leg room. The flight was excellent takeoff and landing was very smooth. I very much enjoyed the flight and the crew were very friendly. I will definitely be flying Virgin Australia again. Highly recommended.

I flew VA's business class from Sydney to Melbourne. The service is highly polished and now have some competition for Qantas. After using the enforced priority boarding lane I sat in seat 1A which is a bulkhead seat on their Boeing 737-800 series aircraft. Practically moments after taking my seat I was offered a glass of fresh orange juice or spring water. Followed by a samsung tablet for entertainment which can now be used from gate to gate. After take off a meal was offered along with a choice of drink. The Cabin Supervisor was very well trained polite my drink was never empty and the service is certainly worth the fare.

### Virgin Australia customer review
Denpasar - Brisbane. Business. Boarding started early and departure was punctual. In my view there is an issue about using a 737 with only 8 business seats for 5-6 hour international flight. My seat was wide but had restricted recline. As this was an evening flight I found it acceptable but would not have wanted to be in it for an overnight flight. The service was personal polite and attentive throughout. However I was surprised not to be offered an amenity kit. I asked for one half way through the flight. The first FA I asked did not initially seem to know about it but one was eventually found for me. I was offered a beef main course for dinner but was surprised that the only choice was between that and the economy vegetarian meal. However the meal and wine turned out to be excellent given the size of aircraft. Overall a very pleasant flight.

Took 5 flights with VA during December/January Adelaide-Sydney-Adelaide on 18th Dec. returning on 21st December. Adelaide-Melbourne-Adelaide on 28th December returning on 29th December. Checked in at desk which was a little slow in Adelaide but check in lady very friendly entertainment on board is as mentioned by previous reviewers by downloading an App-I am oldish (64) so don't know what an app is never mind how to download one. So I read a book Flight was on time with complimentary drink and snack with an option to purchase other food items. Return journey similar. Adelaide-Melbourne return was an award flight (using Singapore Airlines points) so only payment was for airport taxes so only cost $A84 for 2 tickets for wife and self. Flight similar to Adelaide -Sydney above only shorter duration. Once again checked in at desk both ends and check in staff ere helpful and friendly. Adelaide- Melbourne one way on January 5th as 1st stage of Adelaide-Melbourne-Beijing flight with Singapore Airlines. Friendly check in lady was able to check my bag all the way through to Beijing and issue Boarding passes for all flights. All in all 5 very good flights with VA albeit short domestic hops. Flights were all on time good cabin crews flight deck announcements and in my case a good book is entertainment enough for short flights. Was able to use VA lounges in Adelaide Sydney and Melbourne with my SQ gold status. Happy to use VA again in future.

### Virgin Australia customer review
I flew from BNE to ZQN with Virgin Australia. At $355 Australian Dollars it was already a relative expensive ticket for a flight that's only a little over 3 hours long (and booked over 6 months in advance). I even got the lowest fare Economy Lite which meant I had to pay an outrageous fee of $120 at the airport to check in ONE bag! And there was no way to pay it online in advance and BNE airport had no self-service machines to ease the check- in (i.e. long lines). Once on the flight despite it being a 3+ hour international journey there was no complimentary food service. I had to pay about $12 for a sandwich. Another annoyance with Virgin is Velocity their frequent flyer programme. You can sign up for it but not complete the mandatory fields if you live overseas! So you have an inactive useless membership that you can't complete because you can't enter a non- Australian or NZ address. Why is a frequent flyer programme for such a major airline not open to everyone? Especially when they have many international flights. Oh and if you want to use their entertainment system on board the aircraft you have to download an app which is impossible to do without an internet connection. And the Wi-Fi on board doesn't provide internet unless you have the app! So you have to somehow know about this before boarding and download the app beforehand. Completely idiotic. Seats on board were okay and the flight got to the destination on time which is the only positive thing.

### Virgin Australia customer review
Fiji (Nadi) to Sydney 28th December (VA180). Left my daughter and I with the worst opinion we have ever had in regards to airline travel. Lack of cleaning - the back of the seats in front of us had spills / food deposits. There was no inflight entertainment unless you had your own tablet or wanted to pay extra on board. The inflight magazine (some seats missing even this) was well tattered. We had no announcements about the weather / temperature on landing would be or that time adjustments would occur. The meal was dry and we left this offer untouched. I have flown Virgin on domestic runs that have previously given me enough faith to have the confidence to book this flight - never again.

### Virgin Australia customer review
Sydney to Los Angeles and back during December 2014 in economy class. This was my first flight with Virgin Australia and overall I was quite impressed. The flight to Los Angeles ran very smoothly check-in was easy ground and inflight staff were attentive and friendly. The toilets were kept immaculately clean throughout the entire flight. There were three food services - dinner a snack and breakfast - which were all delicious. I found that even in economy there was sufficient legroom and I didn't feel cramped in this aircraft. I really appreciated the little package that we were given with a pen and eye mask inside a clear ziplock bag as I had not brought either of those items with me on the plane. On my return flight to Sydney I really appreciated the early check-in (3pm) that was available at LAX for our 9.50pm flight. As we had arrived at LAX at midday from New York we were able to get lunch check in our baggage and then take a taxi from the airport to do some final sight-seeing and shopping in LA before our flight home. The only issue I had with Virgin Australia was the gate number on our boarding passes was not the actual gate the flight was departing from. This caused some stress and we were in the last group of passengers to board. Luckily we had checked the signage in the airport and were able to get to the actual gate. Apart from this unfortunate mix-up I had no other issues with the flight back to Sydney and would definitely recommend Virgin Australia to anyone travelling this route.

### Virgin Australia customer review
Flew with VA from BNE to MEL return for work. It's been two years since my last flight and whilst VA seems to have got its branding and product consistency together the overall feel leaves a lot to be desired. On both flights I felt the service from cabin crew was basic and lacking warmth. This is in stark contrast to their advertising. Free snack/beverage for the flight was welcome but again I felt that they could offer more than a meagre cheese/crackers combination at lunch if they are trying to compete with Qantas for customers. Overall the flights were on time and got me from A to B and back but I feel that the VA experience is still sub-standard and lacks the personality which they seem to want to hang their hat on.

### Virgin Australia customer review
Flew Sydney-Abu Dhabi. Flight was pretty bad IFE wasn't working properly seat was a little wet asked for a seat change and they said "there were no more left" which was untrue because I saw a pair of empty seats towards the back of the plane. Food was average fish was undercooked and my juice tasted odd. Overall it was pretty bad but from what I can see Virgin is pretty bad at long haul flights. So I probably won't do long haul with them again.

### Virgin Australia customer review
Flew from Melbourne-Adelaide return a few days ago. Just an hour's flight no entertainment going but coming back we were expected to have downloaded their app to access entertainment - no big deal for an hour's flight. We were given water/juice and 2 cookies either way. The FA's were fine the plane a bit grubby but then they don't have time to clean it between flights. My only issue was with check in staff at Adelaide. We were pretty early and I asked if there was an earlier flight we would be happy to go on that I was told "your booking doesn't allow for changes even if we had spare seats but yours is the first flight to Melbourne anyway". Not sure why she felt the need to state the former if the latter was all that was needed. Instead it just left a "bad service" taste in my mouth that was totally unnecessary. So it was an okay flight but Qantas still wins for better service. For the price though I'd choose Virgin again.

SYD-PER return A330-200. Excellent service all round especially the cabin crew out of SYD the food offered was very acceptable for the 4/5 hour flight drinks were offered before during and after meal service. IFE very good arrived on time going out and ahead of time on return. The service on both flights was exceptional certainly better than our last business class trip with an overseas carrier.

### Virgin Australia customer review
20 December 2014 DRW-SYD. I found travelling Virgin slightly confusing - it was sort of trying to be a full- service airline but sort of not. For example because I was travelling on the flexi-fare I was given a bread roll which the person next to me had to buy - not sure the bread roll was worth an extra $700. Available refreshments were basic - would have thought that for a 4 hour flight something more substantial would have been available. For IFE you needed your own tablet just as well I had a good book. Plane was on time was full (as expected) but no delays with luggage in Sydney. In flight service was friendly and quick. In exit row a bit tight on the shoulders even though the gent next to me was not that large but the seat was comfortable enough. Overall a slightly underwhelming experience probably not quite enough to tempt me to leave Qantas but a reasonable alternative if no Qantas flight is available.

### Virgin Australia customer review
Sydney check in and bag drop was very good - no waiting at all. Gate waiting area was spotless however all of the complimentary newspapers appeared long gone. Seat onboard 737-800 was pretty good by the window with several inches legroom in front although the seat was still a bit too narrow. Virgins inflight entertainment app was not available for the flight so I was left to read the inflight magazine which was already worn out despite it only been used for 9 days. Cabin overall needed some cleaning - there were crumbs on my seat from previous flights that could have easily been removed prior to mine and there was a faint smell of vomit hanging in the air throughout the flight. One of the air con vents was missing. Cabin crew was friendly enough but definitely not as well- presented or delivered as an international flight. Complimentary snack was questionable being a tiny capsicum and cheese sandwich which looked to have been made with only 1 slice of bread. Was pleased that the flight arrived in Melbourne ahead of time but waiting for my checked in luggage was almost half the actual flight time.

### Virgin Australia customer review
14-12/2014. Melbourne check in and bag drop was very good - no waiting at all. Seat onboard 737-800 was only just enough in terms of space. Virgins inflight entertainment app was available but the signal was either very weak or too busy because I was unable to connect with my iphone several times and eventually gave up. Cabin was filthy and there was extensive mould and spillage on the seat and particularly the metal joints and was likely made worse by the fact only 1 passenger requested the air conditioning be turned down which made the cabin warmer and more damp. Cabin crew was very gruff and seemed too large to pass down the aisle.

### Virgin Australia customer review
Recently traveled PER-SYD. The trip was pleasant enough however if VA are trying to be "Australia's favourite airline" by 2017 they need to try a little harder. The attendants were less than enthusiastic (this was the last flight of the day I suppose). Whilst they do a "pre-dinner drink" in Economy and a drink with the meal service Qantas has it all over them in the drinks department. When Virgin collect the trays from dinner they bring only the "garbage trolley" - and no other top up drinks Qantas brings drinks with the "collection" trolley and that keeps the natives quiet. We saw no crew wandering the aisles after lights out. All in all average. We expected this from Virgin Blue but things should be different for the "new improved" Virgin Australia.

3 December VA830 SYD-MEL 6 December VA859 MEL-SYD. Boarding at Sydney absolutely chaotic. Was at the gate 10 minutes prior to scheduled boarding time and boarding had already commenced. Further boarding calls were not made with flight number or destination so had to go by the flight status board at the gate - which had a VA flight to Melb at 10am and a Delta flight to Adelaide at 10am needless to say the Delta flight was a glitch. Cabin crew warm and friendly. No issues in having water as well as juice/tea/coffee and a second complimentary snack. Both flights on time. Excellent legroom and recline - very comfortable though on SYD-MEL recline in my seat had a fault and would not stay put! Planes could be much cleaner.

### Virgin Australia customer review
Booked Perth to Geraldton paid for overpriced ticket. Plane was delayed. Finally boarded only to be told we needed to unboard. After another one hour wait in the terminal they found another plane. Reboarded for flight to depart almost 2 hours late. Having just had facial surgery I had made a point of pre selecting a window seat so that my face was not next to another passenger in case it was knocked or bumped. However Virgin had now completed a seat swap from row 2 window (without asking) and I now found myself in the aisle in the very back row. The staff could not have cared less leg room cramped can not comment on food as I didn't eat but assume it offered no saving graces. Virgin I gave you a try but I will be returning to Qantas for all further flights.

KTA-PER - was booked on a Virgin flight meant to be on a B737 however the sector was contracted at the last minute to Alliance Airlines. The aircraft used was old no hot meals or galley and no IFE. The aircraft interior felt like it was from the 1960's era.

### Virgin Australia customer review
Flew SYD-LST and LST-MEL on Virgin and both flights were absolutely fantastic. The LST-MEL was delayed an hour however the staff did an amazing job keeping us all informed on what was happening. The captain told us onboard that it was delayed due to a technical issue. Better to be safe than sorry. Service was very good on this flight. On the SYD-LST flight the cabin crew were excellent. Probably some of the best Virgin cabin crew I've experienced. Flight landed 15 mins early.

### Virgin Australia customer review
BNE-SYD. Mid afternoon flight. 737-800. Aisle seat. Check in was the best thing about the whole experience. The plane was at the gate late boarding therefore late to arrive. Tea was cold when served. Needed to board via Tarmac despite there being a very noisy prop jet getting reading for departure very close by. Cabin crew average. Virgin are a low cost carrier trying to be like Qantas but it isn't working. I'm a regular Qantas flyer and tried Virgin as it was a free flight. Wouldn't go with them again and look forward to returning to Qantas.

Decided to give them a go for one of my regular MEL-SYD trips - very disappointed. Paid too much for the fare for poor service. Will stick with Qantas.

Flew Brisbane to LA 8/10/14. The food was inedible. The cabin crew were okay. The flight back from LA was much better. The food was edible and the cabin crew were professional and helpful. I'd definitely fly Virgin again if the price was right on the proviso that the flight back was better than our flight out this time. If it's as second rate I'd rethink.

### Virgin Australia customer review
SYD-PER return. I bid $400 for an upgrade in each direction and got both - obviously I paid a bit much - but considering the flights were retailing for $2399 one way I still felt I was getting a bit of a bargain. Sydney airport premium entry is excellent - pull up at the kerb and walk straight into premium check in and premium security screening - so easy and then straight to the lounge. The A330 cabin is a very pleasant comfortable place to spend 4 hours - the seat recline is excellent and would be fine for sleeping although I didn't actually sleep on this short hop. Champagne (Ayala) /beverage selection was excellent and the food was pretty good - I got my first choice each time - the starters were a bit lacklustre (some sort of tuna on chickpeas - virtually tasteless) but the mains were pretty good (lamb cutlets - slightly overcooked but delicious). Service was attentive and friendly - just spot on - these guys definitely know what they're doing and no request was too much. I only just started flying virgin recently and as you can see I've been very impressed - they represent a worthy and competitive alternative to Qantas in every aspect of the experience and I have no hesitation strongly recommending them.

### Virgin Australia customer review
In a word appalling. LAX to SYD - we turned back after three hours because the toilets were overflowing into the cabin. Whilst walking around the cabin (in my socks) I inadvertently walked through the 'wet patch' as there was no warning notice or cover put down on the cabin floor. On return to LAX complete chaos as only two ground staff attempted to deal with 300 passengers who needed hotel rooms advice etc - it took hours. The next day was a triumph of disorganization as Virgin Australia staff gave us either misinformation disinformation no information or downright lies about our ongoing flight situation. When we turned back we were informed that it was "for the safety and security go passengers" - later it was announced that it was for "the comfort of the passengers and at no time was the safety of the passengers compromised". We missed an important day at an expensive conference because of this. I understand that maintenance issues arise from time to time - my complaint is with the VA staff and the way the situation was handled. As for compensation: a robotic "Guest Relations Co-ordinator" offered us Velocity points that added insult to injury. I should have listened to more experienced fliers and used Qantas.

### Virgin Australia customer review
Flew Business Class from Sydney to LAX and had a very good flight. The FA's in business were very good and I found the seats and bed comfortable. Food was fine but the entertainment system was poor. Will be much better next year with the new seats. Overall probably as good as Qantas minus the A380.

### Virgin Australia customer review
I returned to Brisbane Australia from America on Virgin Australia VA8 on 7th November 2014 travelling with 2 other friends. We arrived at the airport 4 hours before the flight and immediately booked in together. We did not check our tickets until we had been through customs presuming we would all be seated together. We realised that none of us were seated together and I was seated in another zone. All I could do was let the flight attendant know at the boarding station. She said to let the flight attendant in my section know. I informed her and she basically said the plane was full and there was really nothing she could do. Later she came up and asked where my friends were and I told her and she basically said the plane was full and that was that. To top it off I asked for a vodka and orange and she gave me a very strong tasting drink. She later came and informed me that she had given me gin by mistake and replaced the drink. I was unwell for most of the trip. Not sure whether it was the drink or the food but I felt very uncomfortable for the remainder of the journey.

Sydney - Perth. A330 morning service. Near new aircraft. Business class via "Click to bid" upgrade. Cabin half full and able to move seats. Service faultless and friendly. Nothing too much trouble. Was hoping for the lunch service - but we got breakfast which I thought was quite late in the morning for - close to 11am. Only disappointment was the entertainment system. Although the screen is larger than economy the range and choices was very limited. I think the Qantas economy entertainment is much better.

### Virgin Australia customer review
Flew Virgin Australia AKL-MEL-AKL after a hiatus of about four or five years following some bad experiences with them. What I can say is that the flight was perfectly fine for a low cost airline although VA now position themselves at similar costs to full service airlines. The good - the crew on both flights (NZ based crew) were lovely and came through the cabin regularly to offer water. Complimentary tea and coffee was a nicer touch than what they used to offer (nothing for free). Straight to a check in counter at AKL this morning and the lady there was lovely. Both flights left on time and the flight crew gave us clear and helpful updates. Exit row seat purchased at a very reasonable price so happy to have the legroom. The bad - huge queue to check in at MEL due to 3 flights departing at similar times. I was travelling with cabin baggage only but since there was no online check in I was in a queue for close to an hour. I booked the light fare and thought I would like to add baggage. Couldn't be done unless I paid $120 at the airport or booked an entirely new flight. With a 7kg allowance I was fine for a quick trip but the laptop and other things I would have liked to take stayed at home. Some flexibility is desirable. They didn't have the gate number on any of the screens at AKL on departure despite the flight boarding. Advised the ground crew and he didn't care much for my advice. The inflight menu is poor quite frankly. I always eat on planes and am not afraid to hit the user pays menu. I took my own lunch from the airport on the way back to AKL. Just not appealing. All in all I got a cheap flight but for someone marketing themselves as being above a budget airline VA won't be getting me onboard again soon.

### Virgin Australia customer review
Flew fully flex economy fare that was very poor value for money. Aircraft SYD-BNE very tired old Virgin Blue coloured 737 toilets filthy bins overflowing. Flight left 25 min late despite boarding on time! 2 passengers arrived 10 min after departure. A lot of flight crew for other VA flights onboard. Flight late to leave and late to destination. Stairs used to unload instead of aerobridge. Entertainment non-existent unless to wi-fi. Snack that came with fare made QF's legendary stinginess look actually good. Drinks limited despite what was in the menu not cold. Cabin crew more interested in appearance and seemed bothered by passengers actually asking for things often ignored call attendant buttons. My second leg just as forgettable if not worse. IMO VA still very much a no frills airline albeit more pricy than before that has flashy advertising. I wil l be certainly avoiding them in the future for cheaper options where I get what I pay for!

### Virgin Australia customer review
My wife and I travelled on the direct flight from Phuket to Perth on 29 October with Virgin flight VA192 and we have travelled with Virgin before and had no problems. We arrived at the airport 3 hours before departure and were waiting in the departure lounge when we found out that the flight had been delayed because of weather in Perth. Apparently the Captain had decided that there may be a chance of fog and that waiting two hours was the better option. We ended up boarding about 1am in the morning onto a 737-800. It had a little pretend business class up the front which I think had about seating for 12. The business class seats looked very poor for business but my seat of torture was further down the aisle. A wing exit seat no entertainment no recline on the seat and how skinny can they make a seat? We were extremely lucky to have the pleasure of the stewardess tell us of our responsibilities of sitting in an exit seat and yes I know this is a requirement of sitting here but the attitude of the stewardess was appalling. Not friendly and helpful but bossy bordering on rude she appeared to enjoy listening to herself assert her authority. Once we took off it was the usual farce of roping off the business class section and restricting the rest of the entire passenger list to 2 toilets at the rear of the plane. As we approached Perth the flight attendants came down the aisle with the rubbish bags and proceeded to tell everyone to clean up any rubbish under our seat and any from the back of the seats. The complete disregard for customer comfort connecting flights and delays was breathtaking. It goes without saying (like many other passengers) I will never fly with this dreadful airline again.

### Virgin Australia customer review
I was travelling from Nadi to Brisbane on Friday 24th October 2014 flight VA176 in one of their premium economy seats. Not only was this flight delayed 2 hours - the message Virgin sent did not specify the delay time - but the premium economy seats on the B737-800 were actually economy seats with a drop down table in the centre seat. What a difference to flight VA175 5 days earlier where the seats were proper premium economy seats with a delineation between this section and the economy section slightly more leg room and the crew were much better organised. Why use these old planes with inferior seating when one is paying quite a premium for the supposed premium economy seat. This is certainly not satisfactory. In addition something has to be done about the toilet situation as there was a constant queue of people during the entire flight for the toilet situated in the front of the aircraft. Obviously this needs addressing. The crew on VA176 were frazzled and the service not up to the usual Virgin standard. It is not the passenger's problem that the flight is delayed and I think all passengers were well behaved despite the long delay. Virgin are doing themselves a disservice by using these old planes and I for one will not use them again for this leg. I realise these flights originate in New Zealand so perhaps scheduling needs to be addressed due to the curfew in Wellington.

### Virgin Australia customer review
Sydney - Perth in Business class. Booked on the A330 service which Virgin has been advertising only to be told of a plane change to a 737. The service and experience cannot be described as business class. You have to hang your own jacket behind the seat. The seat only has limited recline and no foot rest. The front seat reclines right into your space so you can barely get the table out. There is only limited galaxy tablets available so I missed out. No seat power to charge your phone. There was no choice of meal as not enough where loaded and did not receive main meal until 2 and half hours into the trip. There was only one cabin crew to serve and was nowhere to be seen for most of the flight. No tea or coffee service. After paying a full business class fare I would have been better off in economy as effectively it was economy service with a little extra leg room. This is not a business class product.

### Virgin Australia customer review
Melbourne to Canberra. Flight delayed in Melbourne because of weather. We were kept informed about the delay. Cabin crew were friendly and managed to provide a light snack on this short flight. Both Cabin and toilet were clean. Helpful check in staff who gave me the seat I wanted. No problems with a slightly overweight bag (problem coming from International Business to Domestic Economy as far as weight is concerned). Flight slightly late in landing (because of late departure but this was beyond the control of the Airline).

We travelled business class from Perth to Brisbane and return. The outward trip was very good but the return trip was premium economy and not business for which we had paid. The seat in front came back into your space your own seat would only go back a few inches there was no foot rest. There was no TV only a portable ipad so you could not watch it whilst eating as it had to sit on your table and there were only ear plugs to listen with not ear phones. Virgin are conning people by describing this as business class and should downgrade it to premium economy and charge accordingly. Australians should make more of a noise and stop this airline from conning people!

SYD-LAX-SYD in Y. Just swapped over to Velocity from QFF so was my first time flying VA to the USA which I do once a year. The 777-300 is a very comfortable aircraft and the 3x3x3 layout is very much appreciated compared to some airlines who squish 10 across on the same aircraft. The cabin was nice and spacious mood lighting adding to the comfort. Cabin crew were fantastic on both legs - all had huge smiles very helpful and cheery and genuinely looked like they cared. In this respect they're better than Qantas. Where they fall down is in the food and IFE. Dinner was nothing spectacular and breakfast options were limited. IFE was worst I've experienced on any long haul airline. There were probably only around 40 or so movies many of which were either kids or foreign language. The few TV series also only featured two or three episodes. QF's IFE is one of the best. I would fly Virgin Australia again.

### Virgin Australia customer review
Having recently flown BNE-PER on Virgin Australia and loving it we treated ourselves Business BNE-MEL return as we normally only fly economy on a route this short. Flight down was great with a personable and helpful crew member looking after the small business class 737 cabin and we really enjoyed the flight. Wine was great and the snack was fine. On the way back the flight was delayed for two hours as two staff didn't turn up for work causing confusion in the lounge and the gate. We had to rush to the plane as the board changed from delayed to flight closed given this rush when on board I asked to use the bathroom and was told "No". When seated I was offered water my wife asked for water but got none but she got wine when in the air. The crew member was surly and we only saw her once after take off. I didn't get offered wine. I asked for a food ingredient list as Virgin Australia don't do domestic special meals and was told there wasn't one and it was "too bad" so nothing to eat for me as well. The only consolation was I saw the crew member who was roughly treating meals dropped several meals in the galley from the oven so only one person got their choice in any case. It was as poor a business class flight as we can recall particularly for me with a glass of water and a scowl my memories of the trip home. The crew member did not want to be on board and we felt was punishing us for being there.

VA 171 to Port Vila. We all realise weather can interrupt travel plans but this was an absolute joke. 13 hours of flying in the South Pacific to arrive back in Brisbane with the banal comment from the Captain and Lead Flight Attendant of "Hope you make it to Vila tomorrow". A flight full of families with young children and one sandwich and a cup of juice for them. We all know you pay for what you get but this is well below substandard. I have had better service of Aeroflot. No wonder it has been 8 years since I have given Virgin Australia my money for the exact same reason of poor customer care.

Perth to Sydney on a brand new a330-200. Seat and legroom are good. IFE excellent! Had both on demand and live air channels with a large touch screen. The food not the best but the service is great. Arrive before the scheduled time. All together better than what Qantas offer on their not yet refurbished a330-300 and some 200s.

### Virgin Australia customer review
HBA-MEL-CNS return. These flights were as I expected: They got me from origin to destination. Booked by my employer I was a little disappointed that I was unable to check-in before arriving at the airport. In-flight service was quite satisfactory although I think many passengers would prefer a better selection of food for purchase. This would possibly make fares a little higher and thus could be an unpopular move. I like the idea of passenger-supplied electronic entertainment; it saves complaints regarding the size quality and condition of seatback screen units. I can recommend VA flights and will be happy to fly with them again.

### Virgin Australia customer review
I would like to share my experience of how determined the wonderful Virgin Australia was to ensure myself and my partner would never fly them again. We arrived at Melbourne to begin our journey to Fiji VA185 on the 4th August this year. At check in the staff member told us that a staff member had failed to turn up and they were short of crew - under aviation regulations the flight could not carry all customers. I asked for further details to which came none other than we were moved off the flight and it was flying with only a half load of passengers. Many thanks to the Virgin check-in staff for this enlightening explanation - we were impressed he could even be bothered raising his finger and pointing to the domestic queue which was a mile long and had to join as we were being re-routed to Sydney. We had an hour and 20 minutes once in Sydney to find Fiji Airways which Virgin had now booked us on. Most of the Virgin Staff that we spoke to seemed to be of the opinion we would struggle to make it from the domestic to international terminal in Sydney in time to get the Fiji Airways flight. Once we arrived in Sydney it turned out that the journey time between the Domestic and International Airports was a third of the time the Virgin staff had told us in Melbourne - with 10 minutes to spare before closing the flight. Apparently their flight was fully booked courtesy of the missing staff member so they offered us Business Class at an upgrade cost of $370. We took the upgrade - what's an extra $740 stacked on to our holiday expenses anyway. So we boarded Fiji Airways - business class brand new plane - friendly staff interested in our well being.

### Virgin Australia customer review
My favoured airline does not fly to Denpasar from AKL does not connect with VA in Sydney so ended up on VA whole trip. Huge mistake! Budget airline but prices are similar to Emirates on sale which is full service. Stupid tiered fare system. Asked for meal entertainment system tea coffee glass of wine when I booked my ticket. Issued ticket with only tea but could not tell from e-ticket that I had no services. Later told it was my fault for asking for the services I wanted I should have researched the tiered fares and requested the correct fare tier. Ridiculous. AKL-Sydney nearly missed flight because code shared Air NZ and they took 1 hr 15 min to check me in. Travelled 5 hours to catch plane hoping to check in grab a bite but check in debacle ruined that plan. Just caught plane about to close doors told my fault should have made my way to gate earlier that's rich given they caused the delay. Looked forward to meal movie relax told no meal argued for cup of tea given movie access out of pity bought sandwich $10. 3 days later flew SYD-Denpasar uncomfortable seat cabin seats barely recline had to use tray table for iPad to use entertainment system cramped. Return trip via Brisbane Denpasar-Bris worst 6.5 hours ever. Faulty air con unbearably hot suffocating in front where I was. It was freezing in back of plane passengers asked for blankets. Brisbane airport I had the worst customer service experience in years. Sleep deprived from trip 05.30am sought to change seat encountered young belligerent man. Nearby FA apologised for his behaviour. Returned home determined to never fly VA again. Rather than try to resolve problems at every leg VA staff simply told me to write in and complain. Would rate zero for everything if scoring went that low.

MEL-PER-MEL A330 Coast to Coast Business Class. What a brilliant domestic business class. We were fortunate enough to have the new 2-2-2 configuration both ways and both flights were flawless. Fantastic food excellent seat with plenty of storage fun yet professional crew great IFE and just a really pleasant ambience in the cabin. Everyone was happy to be there – both pax and crew. Crew happily suggested opening a bottle of champagne despite a 9am flight which was a great start to our holiday. Nothing was too much trouble. The dinner main course I had on the return flight was probably the best dish I have ever had on a plane. This much luxury might be overkill for a domestic flight but gosh it’s a comfortable way to travel!

### Virgin Australia customer review
VA is considered a budget airline but I regularly fly Emirates to Sydney on an A380 meal ICE entertainment system etc for a similar price. Emirates do not fly to Denpasar and do not connect with VA so I booked VA from AKL. Dopey tiered fare structure poor communication appalling customer service. I asked for same service as Emirates meal tea coffee movies. Received tea only. Later told it was my fault for asking for the services I wanted not researching and booking the correct fare tier. Ridiculous. 6.5 hour flight Denpasar to Brisbane horrendous air con not working properly stifling hot suffocating at front where I sat. Cabin freezing at rear passengers asked for blankets. Arrived Brisbane tried to change seat worst customer service experience. I will be flying to Denpasar but I will travel via another Asian country rather than direct with VA.

### Virgin Australia customer review
We recently travelled Virgin Australia Brisbane-Cairns-Sydney. The flights were fine but we did have emergency exit seats. Sydney to Fiji - flight was 1 hr late going out. Toilet in economy had problems on previous flight and was therefore closed. On nearing our destination flight attendant announced crew would be coming through he cabin with cleaning cloths for passengers to clean their tables! I don't think so!! Return journey from Fiji-Sydney - departure was approx. 2 1/4hrs late Virgin did offer $15 food voucher. To make matters worse the flight that was scheduled after our flight left before ours. Inflight food vegetarian option was Pasta other food option was pasta / meatballs - what choice was that if you don't like pasta? The attendant did everything she could to provide us with something to eat while I accept it's not cabin crews fault what food is provided unfortunately she had to take the criticism. Would I fly Virgin Australia or recommend them - never!

VA 193 PER-HKT 1 Sep 4 hour delay with no explanation apart from Operational. Old plane no inflight entertainment unless you download. Not every one has a tablet or want to take a laptop on holidays. Really cramped seating in row 23. VA 192 HKT-PER 10 Sep sat further forward and better leg room inflight service good. Plane nothing special. Not what I was expecting from the looks of their website. Would much rather fly on Air Asia. You know what you are getting then. Not able to purchase Duty Free at Phuket airport as VA have all sorts of extra bag checks even after you and your bags have been through X-rays twice.

MEL-SYD-ADL-MEL. Once again VA were very good in all areas from Check-in to in flight service. Flew MEL-SYD for the day and then to Adelaide that night and was checked in at Melbourne for both legs in a very efficient manner. Seating was good with a snack and water/tea/coffee or juice offered on all flights. Flight from Adelaide to Melbourne was on an Embraer 190 and this is a great plane to fly in. Was moved back from front row of economy due to a passenger traveling with her "seeing eye" dog which of course was fine and the staff were fantastic with her and her companion. All flights on time and very pleasant.

### Virgin Australia customer review
Flew Melbourne - Sydney - Melbourne over the weekend and on their 737 800 services. I enjoy flying VA and service is always excellent. However I have mentioned this before. The airline is starting to recruit male flight attendants with attitude. Reminds me of a competitor and hence why I regularly boycott them. VA has certainly changed it's formula when it comes to their recruitment. Despite this comfortable flight adequate snacks for a short flight and good safe landings.

### Virgin Australia customer review
Useless. Cancelled flight to Brisbane put us on another 4 hours later then put down wrong gate on ticket and sent us miles away from the correct gate so we missed that flight went to Virgin desk and they gave us nothing. On way home flight got cancelled again shifted us to a flight 3 hours which for us was about as useless as Virgin Australia call center assistant. Finally asked if we could wait in the Virgin lounge so I could get some work done on what Virgin had made a useless day but all I got was a price to become a member of an airline which I won't ever fly with again.

### Virgin Australia customer review
Melbourne - Perth and return on A330s in Business. Two very enjoyable flights up to international business standard on a domestic service. The VA lounges were comfortable the seat on board was very nice to sit in and the service in both directions was excellent. Both flights arrived slightly ahead of schedule. Only two small complaints: the menu was the same in both directions. From Melbourne I was transferring to an international service in Perth (having a South African Airways codeshare flight on VA). VA needs clearer and more prominent signage to help passengers find the Business Class international check-in counter. Even staff didn't seem to know where it was.

### Virgin Australia customer review
My wife and I got a good price Melbourne to Denpasar but we flew there and back on a 737 with no inflight entertainment whatsoever. The plane was full and cramped. This plane should be on local flights - it's very cheap of Virgin to use then for longer International flights. Back to Garuda for us!

### Virgin Australia customer review
Melb-Canberra-return. Both flights on Embraer 190 which I think are great to fly in. Melb-Canberra leg was a most pleasant experience given the flight was only 44 minutes. Departed on time and provided with "snack" and water before landing in Canberra. return flight was also very good with an early departure and again offered a snack with a water. Held up by Melbourne traffic control and were in holding pattern over Mt Buller with some spectacular views. Flight crew kept us informed and we landed only minutes late. Both flights were very good. WiFi streaming was also available on both aircraft.

### Virgin Australia customer review
Flew from Sydney to Perth last night. Firstly the flight was over 4.5 hours late to make matters worse the plane had been downgraded which meant I couldn't have the seats I had chosen. The flight was full we were made to board by the rear door while waiting in the freezing cold on the tarmac. I always feel living in WA we are the poor cousins who are never considered. I was unwell so this amount of delay and standing in the freezing cold did nothing to make me feel any better. I told the check in girl but her answer was there was nothing she could do and gave me a meal voucher which really didn't help. I won't be flying Virgin again in a hurry.

### Virgin Australia customer review
OOL-MEL Flight cancelled no reason given why initially told next flight I could get on was the next day but as I had to go to work following day I had to fight hard to be put on a spare seat to MEL via SYD so a 2hr flight turned into a 7 hr horrendous journey. Onboard the live satellite TV has now been turned off and some stupid streaming service now used which requires people to use their own tablet personally I don't own a tablet and walking down the aircraft not one person was viewing their streaming service. Flight attendants announced at start of SYD-MEL flight that a free snack would be offered to each passenger going by the inflight magazine I was expecting a muffin and a coffee we were all issued with 4 Ritz crackers and a lump of cheese I thought I was in North Korea! Virgin is a low cost low service airline which is in fact not low cost so it is just low service with high prices.

Melb-Gold Coast-Brisbane-Melb. All flights were excellent with some minor delays due to air traffic control. Melb- Gold Coast flight was seated in 3A in economy with the extra leg room and no one sitting in the middle it was almost like a business class seat. Cabin crew were great with water or juice offered during the flight. Brisbane- Melbourne much the same though flight was delayed by about 35 mins but kept well informed by flight crew about Brisbane airport traffic delays. Was served a very nice lettuce and egg sandwich and water on the flight and the cabin crew also did another water run before landing in Melbourne. Overall another couple of great flights with VA. WiFi streaming of movies is also a bonus.

SYD-LAX-MEL in Y. Here is a tip. Best Y seats in the house: Row 40 DFG. Bulkhead seats with no bassinet position and not premium charged. Most websites appear to show row 39 as the centre bulkhead seat. Only the VA seat assignment chart gets it right as row 40 centre. As usual friendly and engaging service from the great crew. OK to good food. If you must endure the 15 hours to/from LA then this is a great choice.

### Virgin Australia customer review
ADL-MEL-LAX. Easy check in as always. Good flight from Adelaide to Melbourne - on time. Comfortable seats and very polite cabin staff. Melbourne to LAX left on time. The service in business class is very good and the staff are wonderful but the seats are not the most comfortable when compared to other airlines in that class. The seats aren't much wider than economy seats and are a little hard on a 14+ hour flight. I was in a window seat and was trapped when the person on the outside went to sleep. They squeeze a third seat into the middle group which I'd never seen on other international business class flights. Your pay more for business class to get comfort and privacy and unfortunately the seat configuration doesn't give you this. The inflight entertainment system could do with a revamp as there aren't many choices. The lunch services was great but the breakfast food was most odd and everything seemed to taste of five spice which was a little off putting - sometimes plain and normal is better than over the top. I like that they have a ladies only bathroom!

### Virgin Australia customer review
Very happy with the service on Virgin. Flew BQB (Busselton) - PER (Perth). Got an orange juice and cookie which I was not expecting. I was greeted with a huge smile as I walked on board. After we took off one of the FA's made a point of sitting in the vacant seat next to me and talking about my love for aviation. I was alone and after we landed she walked me through the terminal to my parents making sure I arrived in one piece! I am flying with them again very soon and hope the service is much the same!

### Virgin Australia customer review
On 5 July my daughter and I flew Sydney to Queenstown NZ on Virgin 7406 operated by Air New Zealand. Even though the ticket said 'no meal service' we were offered a meal and later enjoyed a choice of movies. The return flight from Christchurch to Sydney Virgin 7533 was also operated by Air New Zealand. What a difference! No refreshment offered and movies carried a $10 charge. Didn't see an attendant unless you wanted to buy. This was not a cheap flight and after all it was 'International'. I didn't enjoy the return flight and would be loathed to recommend Virgin and their affiliates.

### Virgin Australia customer review
Travelled Business Class Melbourne-Hamilton Island return in the last 2 weeks. 3 hour flight at $1600 return. Whilst the Cabin Manager was friendly efficient and professional the overall product is really substandard for Business. Seats with no footrest limited recline dirty and scuffed nil storage. No pillow or blanket available anywhere on the aircraft. They don't stock them even for Business. Refreshment on the way up consisted on a small tart tub of yoghurt and a roll. Nothing else. Lunch on the return no pre lunch drink a small hot meal bread roll and small cake. Not even a salad. No sparkling available and no bloody mary mix for a bloody mary drink. No hot towel. No amenities at all. IFE consisted of a portable tablet which is annoying to place on a small tray table. Again couldn't fault the Crew who were fantastic. Just a shame they have such a basic product to work with.

Traveled to Fiji and back. I won't hesitate to say that was my worst ever flight experience. Aircraft didn't had built in entertainment system for 6 hour flight from Melbourne to Nadi. Aircraft's seats were very small and aircraft lavatory was too small. I would say it was my most uncomfortable 11 hours of my life.

Flew to Adelaide for business and have to report two excellent flights with Virgin Australia. Both flights were comfortable and with friendly and smiling cabin crew. I absolutely love the Embraer 190 aircraft and it's nice to see a few of them lined up at Adelaide Airport instead of the usual 737 collection. I will continue to use VA for business travel and I enjoy their excellent on-ground and in the air service. Well done Virgin Australia.

### Virgin Australia customer review
My sister warned me against flying Virgin Australia but unfortunately it was booked as an Etihad flight. The cabin was clean modern and with good leg room that's where the compliments cease. The entertainment system was not nearly as good as Etihad very few interesting movies. The earphones were awful scratchy and hard to hear sadly I was so used to Etihad I hadn't bothered to bring my own. The food was awful the service non existent we only saw the attendants when they served food no walking through the cabin offering drinks during the night or the other attentiveness one enjoys on Etihad Singapore Airlines or any of the other great airlines. I would never under any circumstances travel Virgin Australia again.

### Virgin Australia customer review
VA 43 Brisbane - Denpasar on 29th June 2014. To be fair the flight was not so bad but I have to agree with other passengers that Virgin should really consider using a larger aircraft for this popular route as the whole journey took 6hours or so. Otherwise it was not bad at all. The seat felt big despite the standard 737 3x3 configuration. There was no inflight entertainment but most passengers had iPad/iPhone/Laptop etc to keep themselves occupied. The inflight magazine was actually quite a good read. The food was mediocre but I was not expecting 5 stars treatment after all so it was OK. FAs were fine. All in all a pleasant flight and will consider booking Virgin again in the future for other routes.

VA164 - AKL to Coolangatta 25 June. I wasn't aware VA was a 'budget' airline and 700 bucks constituted 'budget' tickets but clearly they did. Booked through WebJet some sort of cock up led to us being charged $260 to take a couple of bags onboard. Upon trying to pre-pay luggage for the return trip advised this was completely impossible by VA. However went to the airport on the return leg expecting another huge bill and baggage checked in without a murmur! Go figure. On the plus side no delays and got us there and back just fine. Don't much like budget airlines however with stupid complex booking tiers and inflexible attitude especially not for a 4hr flight so doubt I'd ever use VA again unless forced to.

MEL-OOL 3 July: Worst flight ever I think it was an old Ryanair aircraft seats did not recline there was no legroom my knees were diagonal to the floor seats are narrower compared to Jetstar or Tiger and there was no inflight live2air rather some silly streaming service which required people to use their own devices. I can't understand Virgin their seats and aircraft are horrendous but then they give people free wine and beer (imported Italian Peroni!). I tell you what Virgin keep your alcohol and take a row of seats out 30 rows in a 737 plus two rows of business class does not work I am still in pain from this horrible flight added to this it was an hour delayed and even while loading the aircraft none of the ground staff seemed concerned and loading was slow and non rushed really disappointed. I don't understand how Virgin thinks this is acceptable.

Travelled on VA 29 to Abu Dhabi on 24/6/2014. This was a code share with Etihad. I was booked business class. I have been flying business class from UK to Sydney up to 5 times a year for over 10 years this flight can only be described as horrendous. Seats are premium economy and although they claim to be flat bed they are like sleeping on a plank! 7 seats per row in cabin if you are in the middle of 3 seats you are trapped. My flight was code share with Etihad how can their be such a difference. The best advice I can give is make sure your flight is not a code share. Cabin crew unwilling to accept complaint re the standard of seating I am unwilling to say more other than beware. It is worthy of note that a number of passengers complained all ignored.

VA 43 Brisbane to Bali June 6. Flight delayed by approx 30 minutes due to crewing. Flight 90% full. We were fortunate to have purchased exit row seats so had a reasonable amount of space for the 6+ hour flight. Crew performed well under difficult circumstances (only 2 toilets at rear of the 787-800 - hence long queues and galley at rear of the aircraft). Food average and some beverages ran out. In-flight wifi entertainment adequate Due to the flying time and therefore comfort this route may be better served by VA with a larger aircraft as Jetstar now operates the 787 to this destination out of Brisbane.

### Virgin Australia customer review
Recently flew Athens-Abu Dhabi-Sydney with Etihad. We had pre-allocated our seating (2 seats down the back A&C) as my wife and I wanted to avoid people climbing over us at night. We got shunted to BC seats with A also occupied and Etihad would not change it or offered a reason. Exactly what we did not want. Unbelievable. The plane was only 60% full and there was no need to cram us into ABC seats. Unbelievable? We checked our original seat allocation and found a 5 year old occupying AC spots with parents in middle section with spare seating alongside. Pretty Poor. When I moved after takeoff into a spare aisle seat with no one beside me the flight attendant moved 2 people beside me in the middle of the night. Unbelievable again when there were spare seats around. Never again with Etihad.

Cabin crew pleasant on all fights and they seem to enjoy their work.

### Virgin Australia customer review
I recently had a trip booked and paid for with this airline from Rockhampton to Brisbane. We had plenty of time to get from Rockhampton to Brisbane for our connecting flight to Bangkok. The afternoon before our planned flight Virgin sent a TEXT message stating our flight was changed with no further details provided. When I called Virgin I discovered they had placed us on a much much later flight meaning we would miss our flight to Bangkok by several hours. Virgin made no attempt to rectify this issue. I then had to drive 8 hours to Brisbane and was initially told I would not receive a refund! After over 2 weeks the airline finally contacted me back and told me I was lucky to receive a refund and it would take up to 12 weeks to process this. It has been over 3 weeks since the flight was cancelled (by Virgin) and I am still yet to receive a refund for this flight. Virgin customer service is the worst I have ever come across - their attitude towards customer satisfaction is disgraceful.

### Virgin Australia customer review
Beware of this airlines baggage fee practices! Their on line policy states that you may "pay a higher rate" if. You don't purchase an extra bag in advance. What they actually mean is 120 AUD versus 48. They also tried to charge us an extra 120 AUD on top of the 120 because one bag was 2KG overweight. 2KG - until we brought a manager in and told him this was outrageous. We were traveling to Fiji from Brisbane with scuba gear a common practice. I don't mind paying extra bag fees per se only the way they tried to triple them in a deceptive manner at the gate. Beyond that the food was the worst I've had in a long time the food service disorganized and the scheduled departure 20 minutes late with no alert or explanation.

OOL-SYD-OOL on B737-800. Virgin lounge at Gold Coast was very busy. Usual selection of food & drinks available. Lounge in Sydney very spacious and not busy. The premium entry facility at Sydney is brilliant. So convenient if you only have carry- on. Priority boarding was a breeze. Seats on board are standard domestic business class seats and comfortable for a short flight. The stand out for this airline is the staff. The attendants serving in the business class cabin on both legs were excellent. Good to see the quality of the food has improved since our last flight.

### Virgin Australia customer review
I flew Perth - Albany over the Easter break. I was looking forward to spending 2 full days with friends but a few days before departure Virgin informed me that instead of the evening flight I would need to take the lunchtime flight. OK these things happen but when I actually checked in the attendant told me the evening flight was operating and had plenty of spare seats! Apparently quite a few other pax were bumped that day too. When I lodged an inquiry with "Customer Care" I was told "After further investigation I can confirm that your flight was revised due to operational requirements and we regrettably had no other option but to reschedule your service. What a load. I couldn't complain about the actual flights the Fokker 50s are ageing but in good condition and flights were on time. Virgin's policy on in-flight refreshments is confusing to say the least - some routes get a free meal others not in Western Australia "some flights" get one but they don't say which. We got light refreshments but any extras had to be paid in cash (not credit card as stated in the menu). It's like they want to be seen as a full-service carrier but can't fully let go of the budget airline ethos - I just wish they'd get their story clear.

Travelled from Launceston to Perth via Melbourne May 6 2014. As usual email and text reminders re departure were spot-on. Check-in and boarding at LST were smooth and efficient announcements clear and accurate. Departure was exactly on time flight uneventful until flight got stuck in a holding pattern for 40+ minutes before landing at Melbourne due to runway incident. Departure from Melbourne was also delayed relevant announcements were clear accurate and informative. Flight to Perth in older B737 no seatback screens and the seatback/headrest adjustment was not working properly (essential for taller passengers) which made for uncomfortable flight (not my usual experience BTW). Bags were waiting by the time we reached the baggage claim area - incredibly quick even by Virgin's standards. All staff were very professional - efficient friendly and extremely helpful. All round not quite up to Virgin Australia's usual high standards but by no means unsatisfactory.

VA23 MEL-LAX Premium (11 H) connecting from OOL. Luggage checked entire way through had to pick up express boarding pass in MEL (not sure if comes with premium or not I'm a Platinum FF). Cabin was practically full with only a couple of seats spare. Plenty of legroom although the 2 heights that the footrest sits at doesn't make it overly comfortable the seat width difference is definitely noticeable vs domestic economy. Amenities bag comes with socks eye mask toothbrush/paste hand cream tissues and a pen (which is more than I can say for SQ business). Headphones provided are noise blocking - and they definitely work. Every meal had tomato and cheese in it which was not only a little disappointing but seriously lacking in originality the chicken was nice and tender though once I scraped the tomato off! Breakfast (scrambled eggs) was so/so the bacon the only redeeming factor in a pretty lacklustre meal. Inflight entertainment (RED) didn't have a massive choice. The best bit would have to be the service. From the FA's to the pilots keeping us up to date on delays could not have asked for better - the staff are definitely what make flying Virgin Australia a happy experience! I used points to upgrade not sure if I'd pay for Premium outright but using points or paying for an upgrade last minute on a return leg is worth it.

VA824 22 April SYD-MEL on 737-800 and return on VA849 24 April also on 737-800. Both flights on time. Check in at Sydney was quite long I had arrived only 45 minutes prior to departure but had checked in on mobile and received my boarding pass at the Guest Service Desk in no time. Plane OK in cleanliness. Excellent legroom and recline. Included tea/coffee/water/juice and muffin as snack. Return flight was on a refurbished 737 with wireless in flight entertainment. I did not use so cannot comment. Seats possibly the most comfortable I have ever experienced on any airline domestic and international. Could not ask for more legroom or recline. Crew excellent combination of youthful and older cabin crew. Flight down to Melbourne were all 40/50+ and could have been more hospitable. Another great flight with my preferred airline. Again booked within 7 days of departure and was the same rate as if I had booked 6 months earlier.

Melbourne-Brisbane on 737-800. Flight to Brisbane left ahead of schedule from the gate however hampered by Melbourne traffic control took off about 10 mins behind schedule. Kept informed by flight crew as to the situation but arrived in Brisbane on time Seat 4D was fine and no one on middle seat. Used WIFI streaming to watch a movie and served a "snack" which was fine. Bris-Melb was a totally different flight when upgraded to Business Class and was the only passenger in the cabin but not surprising as it was Easter Sunday. Was offered juice or water prior to take off and after we had levelled out an excellent lamb curry and a decent red wine were served. Landed in Melbourne on time and luggage was delivered promptly. I might add the service at check in was great at Brisbane friendly and cheerful.

### Virgin Australia customer review
Darwin to Melbourne. The problems started when our flight was rescheduled (not cancelled) from 21st April to 22nd April. This was after we had spent the afternoon at the airport. Told to be back at the airport on 22nd and that check-in would open at 11am for our 2pm flight. We were then put up at the airport hotel. We were given $50 per person to cover dinner and breakfast at an airport hotel! Arrived back at the airport on 22nd at 10am due we waited until 11am but no staff members arrived. Contacted Virgin via the customer relations number only to be told that our fight was leaving at 3.30 pm and that we wouldn't be able to check our bags until 90 minutes before the flight. Customer relations were no help. When staff finally returned at 12pm they were rude and refused to deal with any of the issues. They made no attempt to make any enquiries and stated that we were not entitled to food vouchers as the flight had not be cancelled but only rescheduled (24 hours). I understand that aircraft faults occur but the lack of communication and rudeness was unacceptable.

Flew Melbourne-Sydney-Townsville-Brisbane and Melbourne over the Easter break on their Embraer 190 and 737-800 services. All flights were excellent and with friendly and hard working crews. We had engineering problems with an Embraer jet from Townsville to Brisbane and was transferred to another jet on the tarmac. Unfortunately our connections to Melbourne from Brisbane was not smooth but we did gladly wait 3 hours in the Virgin Lounge to await our 3 delay. Overall was well handled and especially with the Easter rush to get everybody home safely. Well Done Virgin Australia.

### Virgin Australia customer review
PER-SYD-PER Easter long weekend. Both flights A330-200. A330 for the flight to Sydney had a broken APU so had no ground air conditioning until engines started. It was a sauna until 20 minutes into the flight. Obviously old video system individual screens but continuous loop (not AVOD) with poor vision and sound. Food OK and complimentary beer/wine. Return flight much newer A330 with good AVOD. Once again food fine and sufficient along with beer/wine. Significantly less legroom on this aircraft. Check-in for both flights was OK despite being busy days but check-in staff could show some enthusiasm for the job or find another one. The biggest disappointment was the lack of even a casual smile from any of the cabin crew except when first entering each aircraft. After that it was glum faces for the entire flight. The odd smile makes the journey go so much better for both passengers and crew. I normally fly QF but gave VA a go this time based not only on price/schedule but also looking for an alternative to QF for regular travel needs. VA did not stand out as any better than QF I'm afraid. All they proved was that either airline is the same so price and schedule will be all that determines my loyalty now rather than having a true preference.

Sydney to Gold Coast. Early afternoon flight mid week. Quick check in. Long queue to board aircraft only one staff member scanning boarding passes. People impatient some queue jumpers caused arguments amongst passengers. All in all just poor form from VA when they should be managing their customers better. Staff on board robotic but friendly. My first time with VA. I would recommend VA only if QF flight not available.

### Virgin Australia customer review
11th April Sydney to Melbourne VA9900. Return: Melbourne to Sydney VA883. I am absolutely appalled at how bad this airline is. Flights are cancelled and rescheduled all the time. You cannot rely on them at all. The check in queues are ridiculously long they must be understaffed. You need to allow at least 2 hours to check in for a domestic flight. I would advise using any other airline but this one for internal flights in Australia.

Attempt at service falls short. Flying ATR 72 from Moranbah to Brisbane. Staff made no acknowledgement of me boarding and during flight snack was tiny toilet was filthy really stank with yellow stains. Compared with rival seats are not comfortable and the flight is slow.

### Virgin Australia customer review
We flew business class from Sydney to Denpasar 14 April. The cabin supervisor looked after the business class section (5 passengers). She was very professional and friendly the lunch was adequate (2 choices hot or cold) and the wines satisfactory. Then cabin supervisor also ensured that the forward toilet was used by business class passengers only. Although some previous posters complained about the lack of a foot rest for a 6 hour daylight flight the Virgin business class product is quite acceptable and well priced.

### Virgin Australia customer review
LAX-BNE-MEL Business cabin flight from LAX to MEL via BNE Cabin crew on both legs of the flight were excellent couldn't have been more attentive or helpful. Long Haul business class is comfortable and entertainment options are good. A real contrast to the Virgin America BOS-LAX flight which preceded it which featured the most unhelpful and rude cabin crew ever experienced. Overall I would highly recommend VA for the trip to LA and beyond.

### Virgin Australia customer review
On a recent from between MEL and BNE return (on VA 333 and VA 354 respectively) I found that Virgin Australia met all the expectations of a good domestic airline. These included an on-time service good IFE (using their 'wireless in-flight entertainment' system) helpful FAs' and a clean interior. Hence as a regular passenger on this Virgin Australia I do not hesitate in recommending it to others.

### Virgin Australia customer review
This is the second very negative experience I've been part of with this airline. The Dunedin to Brisbane (on both counts) flight the staff are appalling far from helpful and polite. Treatment received is horrible and generally makes flying difficult. I do not recommend this flight to anyone. I would rather pay extra to fly with anyone else!

### Virgin Australia customer review
My wife and I will never fly with Virgin Australia again. We have always found Virgin Atlantic to be great so we decided to fly to Bali with Virgin Australia. I noticed straight away as we sat down that there were no inseat entertainment systems. When I asked a crew member they said we needed to bring an iphone or iPad to watch their inflight entertainment. This policy is ridiculous. So if you have children you may need to bring 3 of 4 iPads for each member of your family for a 9 hour flight? Ridiculous. This airline was cheaper but I'm happy to pay extra for entertainment and better service. This is a budget airline with rude staff.

SYD-CNS 30/3/14. Once again happy with the flight and service. I found the seats and leg room a tad better than Qantas which I flew down on. The cabin crew were friendly and did well with the overseas tourists who had trouble understanding the meaning of the seatbelt sign! The menu has improved since my last flight with more options/variety. Overall happy with the flight and the standard of service is what I have come to expect from this airline.

### Virgin Australia customer review
Melbourne to Adelaide and return in one day. Efficient and pleasant check-in in Melbourne and offered boarding pass for return journey that evening. Flight to Adelaide left right on time and the aircraft offered the wi-fi entertainment system. Landed just ahead of schedule and crew were very good. Return flight delayed due a crewing issue but advised by text and email. Arrived at airport and settled into the lounge. Flight called and departed a little later than we thought but we were kept informed whilst waiting and on board again the tech crew apologised for the delay. Served a "snack" which was very good and crew again were on the ball.

Flight 482 MCY-SYD. 27th March 2014. Flight was cancelled over an hour after scheduled departure. Poor communication. No food vouchers. After the diverted flight had gone to an alternate airport we were told we had to take a flight the following day. No compensation at all. Had to find a hotel at great expense. Jetstar flights continued to arrive and take off. I was told that was due to superior airbus Aircraft Apparently 737s can't operate into airports in bad weather. Their communication with passengers was poor. Well we will now will go back to Qantas/Jetstar.

LAX-MEL Boeing 777-300ER JET. In the airport they said we were flying out of Terminal 3 but it turned out we were leaving from Tom Bradley International Terminal. At the gate they put us on a bus and when it got moving they turned off the lights which made the bus completely dark. The bus took us to Terminal 3 were we had to wait in a line for 30 minutes on a concrete ramp with no were to sit down. Then we went in the thing that takes you onto the plane. The crew was very friendly the set quality good and free in-flight entertainment. They served dinner very soon but I didn't have any. They had a self service snack bar with water soda and chips. Then they dimmed the lights so everyone could sleep which lasted until breakfast time. I didn't have the hot breakfast but I saw it looked terrible. It was some cakey thing with baked beans. The rest of the breakfast was good though. When we landed everything was fine. I would rather fly Qantas because of the thing in LAX but would fly with Virgin Australia if I had to. I have to admit I liked Virgin Australia's cabin quality better than Qantas's cabin.

SYD-MEL (VA 834). The flight was great from the attentive service to the comfortable seating to the on-time arrival. Even though we flew in an Embraer 190 which is smaller than the commonly used 737-800 for this route the service was not compromised.

### Virgin Australia customer review
Melb-Adel-Melb-Brisbane-Melb. 3 flights on 737-800 aircraft and 1 flight on Embraer 190. All flights on time and very comfortable. Service was great with very good cabin crew. Snack served in flight was either cheese and biscuits or a spicy salsa dip with chips. Offered juice or water on all flights. Embraer 190 remains a favourite as I was allocated front row of economy which almost has as much leg room as business class. Overall another very satisfactory series of flights and the streaming wifi on the 737 aircraft is great.

Melbourne-Hobart return on B737s. Both flights were smooth and pleasant. The online check-in and airport bag drop were easy and quick; the seat was comfortable (a little tighter on the return flight) and the service was friendly. The flight to Hobart left 20 mins late and arrived 10 mins late; the return flight left 15 mins late and arrived 5 mins late. Our case appeared on the carousel quite quickly at both ends.

### Virgin Australia customer review
SYD-PER. 21st Feb. Plane used was probably the oldest and dirtiest 737 I had ever seen. Plane completely packed why was an Airbus not used instead? No point boasting about coast-to-coast A330 services when we had to spend 5 very long hours in packed plane with no working seatback IFE. Luckily I had downloaded the wireless streaming app but plenty of other disgruntled passengers did not. Could not upgrade to Business cabin despite the load being 4/8. Sydney lounge was very nice however.

Flying from Launceston to Canberra connecting via Melbourne we were very surprised at not being able to purchase any food on the flight - only option was chic chip cookies which when arriving in Canberra for meetings so after lunch time was not considered a suitable option! Why are healthy substantive food choices not available for purchase?

### Virgin Australia customer review
I am a platinum member and travel frequently - mainly between Gold Coast to Melb return and Byron - Sydney - Gold Coast - although I travelled to NT / Adelaide too. Last year I took approximately 50 flights with Virgin. I mostly travel in economy (row 3) but did manage about 8-10 upgrades into business class. I would say out of 50 flights 45 were good if not great. I would say only 5 caused problems - I had one cancelled (but put on the next flight) and a few staff members over the year that perhaps shouldn't have a job. The vast majority of staff are very good - friendly professional and seem to enjoy their jobs. So my experience has been very positive (I do think it helps when you are platinum / gold).

### Virgin Australia customer review
MEL-NTL. Plane on time. Nice welcome on board by name but wasn't mentioned again like Qantas tends to do. Comfortable seat although a few more inches of recline wouldn't go astray and I would prefer a footrest. Cabin manager very friendly throughout. Meal was fantastic - a great piece of salmon and accompaniments for lunch. A fraction overcooked but it was great nonetheless. Got told they had a chardonnay when it was sav blanc. Drinks freely topped up. Offered Galaxy tabs for entertainment which I declined. It's a great business class on a great airline. Absolute bargain too as ticket was purchased during a sale.

### Virgin Australia customer review
I travelled on 26/2/14 only because Air NZ didn't have a direct flight into Queenstown on 26/2/14. When I asked ground staff at Gate 27/28 to assist me up the airline stairs staff said they couldn't help I was a little offended that they did not offer any help whatsoever. The flight attendants came forward and said that they would help me. But as it turned out they were not there they later came to me and said that they were sorry about not helping but would help on arrival in Queenstown which was great and they did. I would like to say that I am glad that the old rule about height weight & size has been thrown out the door. It was so nice to see voluptuous women serving on the flight with great smiles and very courteous. Seating was great as there was more room for tall people like myself.

I flew Sydney - Los Angeles - Sydney in Premium Economy. The seats are comfortable and the help yourself bar / snack area is greatly appreciated. On Qantas you do get an enhanced meal service (Same standard as Qantas Business domestic) but the meal on VA was satisfactory. Passengers must remember this is premium economy not business light and the VA price reflects this being cheaper than Qantas on the same route.

### Virgin Australia customer review
Flew Virgin Australia ex Hobart for connecting flight with Singapore Airlines to Yangon Myanmar on 1 Feb. The upside they checked my bags all the way to Yangon thank goodness. The downside there was a technical fault with the seatbelts causing a delay by 1.5 hours. Why were they not checked earlier? I did make it to Melb in time to catch my international flight (plus immigration had put on extra staff in Melb which helped enormously) however there were others who had international connections that were delayed by 24 hours. I found a staff member in Hobart to be quite curt but the other Virgin representative was very nice and managed the customers very well. I was thrown a breakfast because it was part of my ticket but I did not want it. Ended up handing it back to another flight attendant. Return flight from Melbourne was better and on time (food average-dry biscuit and cheese).

### Virgin Australia customer review
VA523 Sydney to Gold Coast 21 Feb 14. Not impressed with the level of professionalism of ground staff. 1 person checking boarding passes for a loaded 737. He was doing his best. Another a woman stationed at a counter nearby making one or two announcements including one for passengers in the rear of the aircraft to board. No one listened of course. The queue shortened and a final boarding call was made. I approached the guy checking boarding passes. In front was a man and woman with multiple pieces of carry on luggage without a boarding pass. I was frustrated and said could I go ahead and get on. The Virgin staff member accused me of not waiting my turn. On the way to my seat there was an argument between passengers over seat allocation with crew standing and looking on. Flying up the GC it occurred to me that true their glossy advertising Virgin Australia are all gloss no substance.

### Virgin Australia customer review
OOL-SYD-OOL in business. Easy and fast check in good lounges at either end and priority boarding. On board the seats are ok for a short flight much like domestic US first class. Entertainment available on a tablet or through the Virgin app on your own tablet and the content is quite good. Catering average but forgivable for a short 80 minute flight. Good range of drinks available. In the end the whole experience comes down to the crew. Outbound we had a fabulous FA who couldn't do enough for you. Inbound the FA was fairly disinterested and did the bare minimum. These flight were redeemed on points during a promotional discount and I don't think it would be good value if paying full fare cash.

BNE-SYD-LAX JFK-LAX-BNE. Would recommend flying Virgin Australia. International flights were comfortable and was able to get decent sleep for a couple of hours with the use of the travel pillow blanket and sleep mask. I was served 2 main meals and 2 snacks on the international flight and received them earlier than other passengers because of dietary restrictions. Food not flash but edible enough. Cabin crew could not be more helpful and attentive. The pilot on return from LAX kept us updated on the extreme turbulence we experienced for the majority of the trip which was calming. Excellent array of in flight entertainment. International flights weren't sold out which meant I could lie down across 2 seats. Check in and arrival was smooth. No delays. Aircraft comfortable spacious and quiet. Have booked Virgin Australia again for my holiday to Fiji and always fly with them for domestic flights with no dramas.

Melb-Hobart Return. Both flights on time and Melb to Hobart leg on Embraer 190. Service was excellent with great cabin crew and pilot was pointing out scenic parts of the flight. Return left slightly late but again crew were fantastic with the lights turned down for take-off and as we were not landing until late in Melbourne the view from the 737-800 was fantastic. Overall another great couple of flights with VA. Their check in staff at both airports were also great and as a Gold Flier with VA I really appreciate the Priority lines.

VA342 BNE-MEL. The pleasant service at the Virgin Australia lounge continued on board the flight. On arriving I was offered a choice of a refreshing non-alcoholic cocktail water or coffee. The seat was spacious and comfortable even without reclining. The 4.55pm departure meant that a "late-afternoon snack" was served with a choice of a cold meat platter (which I found to be delectable) or vegetarian enchilada on offer. The IFE included use of the "wireless in-flight entertainment" as well as complimentary use of a Samsung tablet. The tablet was relatively user-friendly. Overall I was very pleased with the service and highly recommend it to anyone.

Flew Melbourne to Coolangatta on Sunday 9/2/14 with this airline and never again. The flight was sitting on the ground for over an hour we were moved to different parts of the runway and 55 minutes after the scheduled departure time we had wheels up. What was so disappointing with this flight was that the crew never switched on the A/C whilst on the ground so we sweltered in 30* heat no updates as to what was happening and then when I asked for a sandwich I was given an egg sandwich which I asked if there was anything else! She promptly said no. Also Virgin Australia never leave on time.

Phuket - Perth VA 4148 Business Class 1 February 2014. Probably one of the best business class experiences I've had for some time. A beautiful new 737-800 with a small business class (2 rows of 2-2). Upon boarding I was greeted and shown to seat. Samsung tablet earphones pillow blanket and amenities kit already placed on seat and in seat pocket. Offered pre-departure drinks (no champagne on board) and soon after take-off beverages of choice. Passengers were offered the meal service at any time throughout the 6 hour 15 minute flight and a cheese and fruit platter at any time after that. Nice not to be rushed for once. Drinks were continually topped up and cabin crew checked on passengers needs constantly throughout the flight. The crew were attentive friendly and professional and must be complimented on the superb level of service they gave to all passengers in this business class cabin.

I travelled from Canberra to Sydney and the next day onto Port Macquarie overnight and then returned to Canberra via Sydney. That is when the problem began at check in at Port Macquarie. As one company was paying for my CBR-SYD sector and the other was paid by another company I was on two different itineraries. I was told that they could not check me through to Canberra and that I would have to re-check at Sydney. Doing the right thing checking my cabin bag as it was over the prescribed weight. That day the weather was diabolical in Sydney closing the airport for some hours which caused chaos. Arrived late into Sydney and held on the ground engines running for about 2 hours I was assured that I would make the connecting flight. In short I missed my connection to Canberra as the check in was so over loaded and too few staff to handle it. I was then told I would have to stay at the airport all night (not likely) as there were no hotels left in Sydney. As I say I am now not one bit loyal to any airline I shop for price and convenience.

Perth-Port Hedland-Perth. Work trip. Morning flight out late afternoon home. Both flights on time and comfortable. Breakfast on outbound just OK but complimentary roast beef wrap on return was delicious. Crew pleasant. Left my kindle on the outbound flight and it was waiting for me in lost property on my return to Perth. Would recommend as a good alternative to Qantas now.

### Virgin Australia customer review
Melbourne to Adelaide one way. Booked the flight only two days before travelling and secured a $105 fare - very good value. Flight left and departed on time. Plane was an Embraer 190 - so comfortable with 2x2 seating rather than 3x3 in a 737. Food and drinks have to be purchased but this is not unreasonable given the cost of the ticket. Service was helpful and professional. One strange thing - Virgin sent me an email inviting me to bid an amount to upgrade to Business Class. When I clicked on the request I was advised this was not possible for this flight. Why then send the email? And there were five out of six Business Class seats empty on the flight.

Flew AKL-MEL as part of ADL-AKL-ADL depart AKL 06.30 on 12 Jan 2014. Given misleading info in email about check- in times (we were far too early as it turned out). As a Velocity Gold member self and partner (on same ticket) had access to NZ lounge - very nice. VA check-in counter not listed on flight departure boards when we found it the check-in staff member was polite but cold - maybe it was too early in the morning. Departure on-time. The aircraft was tired. Staff were indifferent. There was no IFE other than BYO with the VA App. Since the code sharing with NZ started you can get a better fare via VA and if you choose the NZ flights for the trans tasman sector you get a much better product (which on our outbound had included the NZ Works package). VA need to lift their game on their short haul internationals - the experience was lousy in comparison to their BNE/SYD/MEL - PER domestic and not as good as that of their NZ code share counterparts. Reading the reviews I get the impression that all the VA short haul internationals need some work (e.g. SYD-DPS) with attention to aircraft staff and product offering. Why do I get a better experience on MEL-CBR or MEL-PER than AKL-MEL?

MEL to NTL 18 Jan on E190. Aircraft full. Counter check-in staff friendly and efficient as were the cabin crew for this 1.5 hr flight which departed on time. Having just flown a few days earlier on a competitor airline this was a good comparison. No complaints other than seats uncomfortable. Purchased tickets well in advance at a bargain price.

We travelled to New Zealand and back on Virgin. On the way over the cabin was too cold and when I requested for a blanket the cabin crew said it was only for Premium economy passengers. The way back was even worse. The flight was combined with Air New Zealand passengers who get meals on board so we had to wait for 1.5 hrs until the trolley came to the aft of the aircraft to our seat when I requested a glass of water the crew were rude saying "everyone is waiting" and refused to give water to my son saying he has to wait. I want to give zero star to all the areas but unfortunately the system is accepting a minimum of 1 star. No star for service and attitude.

Returning to Sydney from Los Angeles 11/1/14 (a 14hr+ night flight departure 20.55pm). My family and I went to sleep before dinner was served. Missing this there was no food (water was offered) whatsoever until breakfast 2 hours before landing at Sydney. This makes for a 12 hour fast. On waking up I went forward through a curtain from economy to premium economy - to the galley area located ahead of Premium economy to ask for some disembarkation forms. I was informed that they would be distributed later. This never happened and eventually I procured and filled them in after landing. However on returning to economy I went past my seat to the toilets located further down in the economy section. As I was about to close the toilet door behind me a steward who I had passed in premium economy on my way back to economy appeared and informed that I was not supposed to enter another class of seating. Moral of the story - bring your own food on international flights or risk starving as food is not even available at a price in economy. All international overnight flights I have previously taken have made it a point to wake up passengers when dinner is served and always snacks are periodically offered. Perhaps Virgin should take note.

HTI - SYD - 2nd Jan 2014. Had a great time on Hamilton Island with the family. Arrived at the island airport to travel home and the check-in line went out the terminal down the ramp and into the car park. After about 35 minutes we made our way up the ramp and into the check-in area. One person to check-in 150 passengers. I did notice another Virgin staff member coming and going waving a radio around check a passenger or two and then disappear again. We had now been in line for 1.4 hours and it was apparent there was no way this plane was going to leave on time. 30 minutes before scheduled departure the staff member waving the radio around and another staff member arrived and the check in intensity increased. The plane left 15 minutes late due to the poor check-in. Once on board we were seated down the back this seems to be where they put all the young families a bit like a flying crèche. If the kids are going to scream let them all scream together. Prior to the flight we received an email from Virgin to download the entertainment app for the flight. We downloaded the app but alas the entertainment system on board was not working. Being in the 2nd back row the food cart eventually arrives and there is only a few crumbs left that that the other passengers didnt want. All the decent food had gone. Maybe they could start the service at the back of the plane and then move forward or carry enough of the good stuff for all. We were offered a complimentary noodle dish but it was too spicy for the kids. Once the food service was completed they started the rubbish collection I tried to hand over the rubbish to the flight attendant as they passed me but was told to hang onto the rubbish until they got to me later. The procedure seemed to be collect the rubbish from the front then push the cart to the back and collect the rubbish front to back. When we arrived in Sydney our bags arrived quick and we were on our way.

MEL-PER-SYD. A330 aircraft in excellent condition and used complimentary upgrades as Platinum Flyer for all legs. Boarding in Melbourne was on time and allocated seat 1C. Headset blanket and pillow provided on seat and was offered a drink prior to take off. After take off was offered and amenities kit. Lunch menu was terrific with soup main course and cheese platter with some great wines. Movies were up to date and screen and controls were fine. Staff were attentive and friendly and offered water or drinks during the flight which arrived in Perth right on schedule. Perth to Sydney was a repeat performance with great service and delicious food. Wines on offer were also top notch. You would almost think you were travelling with one of the best Asian airlines which all have an excellent reputation for Business Class service. Virgin Australia is right up with the best. Lie flat seats are an absolute bonus for a quick nap.

My husband and I just returned from Australia and New Zealand. We have traveled many places but never on Virgin Australia. We took Delta from Atlanta to Los Angeles then Virgin Australia to Sydney Australia and coming back we traveled on Virgin Australia from Auckland New Zealand to Sydney then to Los Angeles then Delta to Atlanta. We were very pleased. Firstly when we entered the plane the stewardess greeted us. Secondly in our seats were a blanket pillow and a gift package with earphones earplug eye pads and an ink pen. This packages was given to us to and from our destinations. On the way from Auckland to Los Angeles we had really bad turbulence but the pilot came on the intercom and informed us that we would have to stay in our seat because of it. This alone was reassuring and informative. The stewardess check quickly to make sure everyone had there seat belt on. The pilot did a great job because it was rough. The steward and stewardess were very friendly and tried to make our 15 hour flight as pleasant as possible.

Travelled business class from Canberra to Perth. Their business products were professional! The flight from SYD to Perth was on an A330. The seat pitch and width were excellent for this 5 hour flight. Staff members addressed you by last name and they showed great courtesy and professionalism. The dinner was served in a 3-course manner and each was accompanied by different glasses of wines. They had quite a substantial drinks list too. Excellent! I was even able to catch on sleep on its angled flat seat. Loved its amenity bag too! However its IFE Didn't have much selection. Loved their very generous baggage allowance too. Overall very impressed!

We flew to Newcastle from Brisbane yesterday in Economy. Virgin got us there on time and safely and the seat was comfortable enough for the 1 hour flight. When choosing your seat do not go for seat 9 a b or c in the Boeing 737-800 aircraft - these do not have windows. The cabin crew did their job efficiently but they weren't very warm. The aircraft we flew on had seatback TV which we didn't use but it's nice that it was there. I have flown in business on Virgin and there are no TV's there they just give you a portable DVD. For economy passengers - it's buy on board we didn't buy anything but prices were reasonable. Things I do not like about Virgin Australia is that when pre-selecting your seat when you make your booking the only seats that are available are the seats in the rear section of the aircraft. If you get one of these you may be lucky enough to change to a seat at the front of the aircraft when you do the web check in. I feel that Virgin Australia do treat saver fare passengers like second class citizens by only allowing seats at the rear of the aircraft when they make their booking. At major airports the jetbridge is used for business class full fare passengers and passengers lucky enough to get seats up to row 16. The rest of the passengers have to walk down the stairs outside and up the stairs at the rear of the aircraft. Overall my first choice for domestic airlines in Australia is Qantas and Virgin are a close Second.

CNS-BNE-SYD. Prompt checking at CNS and fast baggage delivery at SYD. First flight was on a 737-800. Very clean interior but seat pitch is tight. Second flight on an E-190. Once again the cabin was spotless and comfort on a par with other airlines which have this aircraft. Both sets of crews were efficient but not overly friendly. In economy you get free tea coffee or water and can buy other drinks and food prices of which are average for an LCC anywhere in the world. Generally I was impressed and would use them again if I return to Australia and their price is right.

I just flew with Virgin Australia from Brisbane to Los Angeles. It was my first time flying international with Virgin and I have to admit I was a little worried. Turns out I was very impressed with Virgin and they are now the best airline I have flown with international. The plane was nice new and very comfortable. There seemed to be a little more leg room than the other airlines I have flown with. The food was lovely and the staff were very friendly and helpful. The seats were very comfortable and the onboard entertainment was great. I would recommend flying with them to anyone and I will have no hesitation in booking an international flight with them again.

Sydney to Sunshine Coast (Maroochydore) and return four days later. Check in staff excellent very speedy ignored my overweight cabin baggage. Left on time free tea/coffee/water and seat selection. Clean aircraft screen on seatback with 20 live Foxtel channels. Cabin crew good. Return check in staff were excellent fast and didn't weigh my bags cabin crew excellent clean plane again with Foxtel on seatback. I didn't realise you couldn't pay with a debit card only credit card after ordering sandwich and chocolate I said never mind ordered tea instead. Received the tea and then given the chocolate bar for free. At their price for in flight entertainment free refreshment and cheaper than Qantas it is no wonder Virgin is the preferred choice. Would fly again in a heartbeat. Cannot fault. Plus lots of legroom and I am tall!

### Virgin Australia customer review
Our flight from LAX to SYD was great but after we connected our bags did not arrive in Auckland. And since them Virgin Australia has been just terrible. We landed over four days ago but still don't have our bags. They've actually been found in Sydney but still not "processed" to be sent to Auckland. Terrible customer service from their baggage department.

### Virgin Australia customer review
The crew were excellent! Due to storms the flight was cancelled as the plane had not left Auckland and there were no other available flights that day to Auckland. Virgin Australia dealt with the situation very well they were updating us frequently and handing out refreshment vouchers. They quickly taxied us all down to Brisbane (there was no available accommodation in Coolangatta) and booked us into a hotel and gave us a free $50 voucher for hotel food. We were flown from Coolangatta airport the next day after being bussed down to Coolangatta. Would definitely recommend. Virgin were easy to deal with very polite and even though there were delays flying with virgin was an enjoyable experience.

Melb-Sunshine Coast Return. Both flights on 737 aircraft. Was lucky enough to travel Business Class on both legs and found the experience outstanding. Flight from Melbourne was delayed due late inbound aircraft but was turned around very quickly. Greeted by name when seated and offered juice or water prior to take-off and after we had reached cruise was offered an excellent "snack" of a toasted sandwich along with tea or coffee. Flight landed about 20 mins behind schedule but we were on holidays so no fuss. Return flight was just as good with excellent service both on the ground and in the air. The WiFi streaming was available on both flights and offered a great array of movies and music. In all terrific flights with great crew.

### Virgin Australia customer review
Booked connecting flights MEL-SYD-OOL and OOL-ADL-MEL with 3-4 hour stopovers in Sydney and Adelaide via Virgins website as flights were actually cheaper than direct non-stop. Had plans to do things in Sydney and Adelaide. Trip was a disaster! At check-in in Melbourne was given another persons boarding pass despite girl checking my ID. Baggage labelled with other passengers name. I had to point error out and girl attempted to get bag retrieved. Promised it had been fixed. Luckily other passenger also going to Gold Coast as on arrival bag not on carousel. Found it at baggage services still with other passengers name on it. Meant I spent 45 minutes waiting for bag. Flight to Sydney delayed nearly an hour by fog but no delay information. No entertainment on any flight and food very poor! Has anybody actually been on a Virgin aircraft that has their mysterious entertainment system? A very small cold chicken pasta salad with a revolting chocolate mousse is not what I would call a Gourmet meal as Virgin describes it. Email then sent to my home address whilst away rebooking my flight home as direct at different time with arrival into Melbourne 5 hours before connecting bus home to regional Victoria. No phone call despite Virgin having my mobile number. Had to ring them to get flights changed. Would not put me back on flights I had booked and very insistent I flew on flight they wanted me to! Ended up being rebooked on flight via Sydney but still had to wait over 2 hours for bus. No way would they offer any compensation such as an upgrade to business class. Made to feel that it was all my fault. Sorry Virgin but you have a long way to go in Customer Service!

### Virgin Australia customer review
SYD-MEL Economy. One of the worst experiences I have had. Had a death in the family and needed an earlier flight home. Got to the airport 3 hours before my flight and explained the situation. I was happy to pay any $$ difference whatever it costs to get an earlier flight. They rudely refused. They sent me to the virgin lounge to see if they could help me. They looked me up and down and realised I was a Red member only so told me sorry can't help you. I found someone else at the departure area who told me I have to call the call centre to change my flight. Here I was on hold for 25 minutes trying to get through to a Philippine call centre while I had 4 Virgin ground crew watching me and no one could change my flight. Virgin might be great in the air but their ground services are hopeless. Australia needs a full service airline that cares about its customers and offers value for money.

### Virgin Australia customer review
Had two economy seats booked on flight VA519 from Sydney to Gold Coast. After check in went to departure lounge and waited almost 4 hours before being advised that the flight was cancelled. We were told 4 conflicting reasons by Virgin staff why the flight was cancelled. Lies lies and more lies. We were to attend a wedding in Byron Bay I was due that Friday afternoon. Virgin gave us 2 choices an 8pm flight to Brisbane or a 9.10am flight the next day to GC and no apology. We took the 9.10am flight and arrived in Byron Bay at midday. Please note Virgin Australia is completely unreliable totally irresponsible and care nothing for their clients.

### Virgin Australia customer review
Flew MEL-ADL ADL-SYD SYD-AYQ SYD-AUH. Domestic legs: the ground staff were polite and willing to help planes were pretty new seats comfortable flights on time. Flight attendants were ok. If the price is right then they are value for money. International leg: ground staff just ok they totally lacked of knowledge on why they could check our bags only to Rome and not Florence. In the air it is a mixed bag the hard product in economy is one of the best and our 14hrs flight to Abu Dhabi was nice food was ok they even had 3 options they give you a bottle of water which you can refill throughout the flight. The flight attendants/stewards ranged from very cheery to downright rude.

MEK-SYD return MEL-SYD 737-800 SYD-MEL Embraer 190. Arrived at airport well within time for flight and was offered a seat on an earlier flight which suited me as I only had carry-on luggage. Seated in Row 3 aisle and was offered newspaper and a tablet after take-off. Service was very good and was offered tea coffee or water from the trolley. Flight landed on time in Sydney and we were given a thorough rundown by the captain of our arrival and what views those near a window could expect. A nice touch! Return to Melbourne on a 190 love these aircraft with their 2x2 seats. Again arrived at Sydney airport early and without even asking was offered an earlier flight with an aisle seat which I accepted. With no luggage I then used the Premium Entry at Sydney airport and breezed through security in time for a quick coffee prior to boarding. Seated in Row 4. Service was great and crew very efficient.

### Virgin Australia customer review
On 9th of September I flew on VA942 between Brisbane and Sydney. On a Boeing 737-8FE with the BSI. This was my first and last time flying VA I was expecting the premium product like that of Qantas that VA had been advertising. I was severely disappointed. Upon check-in I discovered that VA charges extra for checked luggage. Since VA consider themselves a premium airline I expected them to offer an all inclusive fare. Everything went downhill from the moment I boarded the aircraft the staff were rude and condescending towards me I was not offered the complementary Tea Coffee of water the steward pushed the trolley straight passed my row. Overall I was severely disappointed in the product of Virgin Australia.

### Virgin Australia customer review
Travelled from Sydney to Cairns aboard a Boeing 737-800 aircraft. I was in seat 30A which is probably the worst seat in the cabin. It's the last row of seating in front of the toilets and offers no recline whatsoever. Three hours is a long time to be seated upright in a very narrow seat. But what I couldn't believe was that for whatever reason there was absolutely no in-flight entertainment. There is an app that you download to your smartphone so presumably one can watch TV programs or movies. But that was not available for some reason. The only reason I booked Virgin to Cairns was because my last Virgin flight on this sector I watched a movie on an individual seat back TV screen which Qantas did not have at the time as they still used a mainline cabin screen where everybody watched the one film at the same time. So stuck in a cramped seat with no recline no inflight entertainment a poor choice of food that I had to pay an exorbitant amount for ($10 for a revolting chicken and mayo sandwich) and cabin service that was more about keeping the herd in order rather than delivering something resembling customer service. I refuse to be spoken to so rudely by a girl half my age just because she's wearing a uniform. So needless to say will probably never fly Virgin on long sectors again in case the events of this flight are repeated. Travelled Qantas on the return sector and couldn't fault a thing!

My wife and I travelled Sydney to Abu Dhabi in Premium Economy seating. Perfect service but food was terrible. Was offered a cocktail pie with gravy - so much for better standard of meal. Good wine service even though the bubbly served when we got on was the cheapest they could find. We booked this fare through a travel agent we were informed 3 weeks before our departure that we would be downgraded to economy as Virgin aircraft was being removed that day for service. Etihad service food wise much better but might use Qantas or Cathay Pacific.

The check-in was fast the check-in staff were so polite. I was in Business and my bag was 28kg I couldn't carry it properly so the check-in lady picked it up for me. Since we were in the curve side entrance we got direct access to the lounge and it was beautiful. The drinks and food were excellent. Onboard the flight attendant was doing many jobs but as soon as I walked on she said 'Hello' with a smile! After take off I was instantly served delicious food and an orange-juice. I bought my laptop on-board with me and I used the WiFi service. The aircraft was modern and we had a beautiful new VA livery. This was a 2.5 hour flight from TSV to SYD.

### Virgin Australia customer review
Regularly fly the Newcastle - Melbourne route amongst others. Seats comfortable staff friendly new IFE system using iPhone or iPad works well - I hope they keep the content updated. Don't really order much food or drink on the plane but the free water is appreciated. I agree with the previous reviewer's sentiments about only having one flight a day - Jetstar has 3 on this route; I detest flying Jetstar so the addition of more flights would be very welcomed by the community here. I have found tickets to be comparable if not cheaper to Jetstar for incomparable service.

### Virgin Australia customer review
Sydney to Melbourne 26/11/2013. Economy. A very enjoyable flight. The staff were very friendly and professional and free drinks were included on the late afternoon flight. IFE was good but it's a pity that no music selection was included just TV programs. Food was not included. It may be worth considering giving passengers the option of prepaying for meals when booking the flights rather then paying by cash or card.

### Virgin Australia customer review
I travelled on Flight VA 1179 from Albury to Sydney on the evening of Friday 22 November. We were delayed leaving and then had to detour to Canberra due to the severe storms in Sydney. We finally landed in Sydney at about 8.45 but were unable to disembark until just before 10pm due to the huge backlog of planes trying to disembark. During the 5 hours we were on the plane I must congratulate the young cabin crew particularly the young lady who tried to keep us all informed as the delays continued. They were both very professional even when a few male passengers were very rude demanding to get off and refusing to stay seated. The young lady ended up in tears but was thanked by most as we disembarked. I congratulate them both for keeping their cool as the situation was not the airlines fault.

### Virgin Australia customer review
Newcastle - Melbourne return. They charge more than Jetstar and it shows. Friendly staff on time flights and unlike Jetstar they offer complimentary coffee - a much appreciated gesture for caffeine addicts. The only improvement I would suggest would be to offer two direct flights a day rather than one Newcastle Brisbane Melbourne is a very long winded way to get to Melbourne from Newcastle.

### Virgin Australia customer review
Flew on Virgin Australia between Kalgoorlie and Perth on their Boeing 737-800 the flight was on time and the airline now definitely has a better edge then Qantas. The flight had individual TV's and inflight WIFI and the food was good. As part of Inflight you got to select what u were watching unlike the other rivals on this leg. Good decision flying Virgin over Qantas.

### Virgin Australia customer review
Have been flying Virgin Australia extensively throughout October and November and have been very happy. Travelled from Melbourne to Sydney over the weekend on their 737-800 services and both flights were very comfortable. Staff are efficient and friendly and always smiling. I do have a concern actually with some of the their male flight attendants. Many have too much "attitude" and sadly are a reminder of the male cabin crews with their competitor here in Australia. This is certainly a recruitment issue that needs to be watched. Otherwise a good airline.

### Virgin Australia customer review
Mel-Lax put in seats next to young baby plane third empty we asked to move but it was too much trouble for the steward we asked another who moved us straight away food very poor bread rolls stale genuinely the worst airline food I have eaten. Lax-Syd again poor food but quick service for delivery/clean up although they seemed a bit put out when I asked for a drink reply "we will serve it with dinner" wasn't really what I expected. Plane arrived late in Sydney meaning we missed our connection to Perth we didn't know that while standing in a line waiting to check in (no information at all from cabin crew on flight). On checking in greeted by a man from Virgin who thought it was funny that we were now being sent via Melbourne and then onto Perth 5 hours later on us getting a bit annoyed with the whole Virgin experience. Taking away the poor service rubbish food there was plenty of leg room and on board entertainment was good but I cant get past the very poor service and will never fly Virgin again.

MEL-OOL Return in Economy. Flight departed Melbourne on time and was allocated aisle seat in front row of economy. Offered water or juice during the meal run. Seating very comfortable with the extra leg-room. Landed on time and luggage delivered promptly. Return flight delayed due late in-bound aircraft but kept fully informed by staff. Had checked in on-line for seat 3C however found I was allocated 3E which is in the middle. Asked at the excellent Virgin lounge at Gold Coast airport if an aisle seat was available and was then offered an aisle seat in the exit row which was great. Not Virgins fault but the Gold Coast airport is a shambles! They have spent a lot of money on renovations but there are people milling about all over the place waiting to board flights. Flight to Melbourne was terrific and purchased a sandwich for lunch and again was offered tea/coffee/juice or water. Landed around 15 mins late and luggage was on the carousel when I had arrived to collect it. Overall another excellent flight with VA. The only downside was the wi-fi entertainment system was not working on both flights. Luckily had a book to read.

### Virgin Australia customer review
Flights booked for trip to Cook Islands (Raro) to fly from Sydney to Rar. Decided to pay for the works ie food and entertainment. No problem to Auckland. Auckland to Rara we were bumped off the list and in the confusion were not allocated food beverages or entertainment. The flight was delayed over an hour. Cabin crew insisted we were not paying passengers. Then returning from Raro to Auckland we were again bumped off the list and had to wait till 99 to get seats. We were then offered exit position seat as that was all that was available despite having paid for the works. The best part of this ordeal was the last leg from Auckland to Sydney probably due to the fact that it was not a VA flight but Air NZ. Found the cabin crew mostly sullen and unhelpful.

### Virgin Australia customer review
Sydney to Denpasar Oct 28. Flew business class but I can honestly tell you do not waste your money with this airline. I fly frequently so I am used to a few problems etc. but this was a joke from the beginning. 8 seats which have very little recline very similar to economy. No bubbly offered apparently no longer on offer. No foot rest my partner and I were offered two choices for lunch. One was goat cheese salad and the other was salmon however it had run out. Let's not forget there are only eight people in business? So I said I would have the cheese packet you get on flights but no they also no longer do that either so I ate nothing. Then I was offered ice cream which came out warm. They quickly removed them apologising. Luggage last off plane. It was embarrassing. Staff however excellent.

MEL-PER VA 685. PER-MEL VA 686. Virgin Australia (domestic) have lifted their game since we last used them. They now provide free beer and wine and a meal at least on the Melbourne-Perth route. This is a definite improvement on the $7 chicken roll. I guess they are repositioning the brand since they bought Tiger. Being tall the ability to pay extra to secure an exit row seat is the big decider in selecting a domestic airline.

### Virgin Australia customer review
Night Flight MEL-PER. I was seated in the very back row of economy - on the aisle and pleased (at least) to have the only spare seat on the plane next to me. Soon to be seen struggling down the aisle was a parent and infant. The parent took up the single aisle seat across the aisle from me. Babe in arms. I offered to swap seats as I had the free seat next to me. Done - thanks all around- I know what it is like to be travelling with a child so was happy to provide them the extra seat space. After take off I was tapped on the shoulder by FA and escorted into business class. During the flight I was approached by every one of the cabin crew and thanked for my gesture. Surprised and appreciative - and advised by the crew that sadly my simple gesture was very rare indeed. Now that is disappointing! Well done Virgin Australia for excellent customer service.

PER-DPS return Business Class. SQ Lounge in Perth a very nice touch. Flight up was delayed however made up time in the air. Food service and beverage service was up to par. Flew older 737 800. Outbound crew couldn't do enough. On the return - access to Premier Lounge this is barely adequate with minimal food and beverages very basic and shared by a combination of carriers. I also believe that the outside world can pay for access. To top it off they call us out of the lounge and to the holding area 1 hour before the plane had even arrived at DPS. So we sat in the holding area for nearly 2 hours before boarding. They knew where we were why make us leave the lounge and sit for 2 hours in a holding area. Business Class should be the last to be sent to the gate for immediate boarding first not really up to Business Class standards. The meal and beverage service on the return was adequate but sparse. There were only 8 people in business class on a 737 so if someone wants the cheese plate its not a good look to forget to bring it out. Disappointing compared to the outbound and against recent trips with Garuda Business Class on the same route. Upgrade the plane with a better IFE system  the Ipads are inadequate and the selection is very limited. When there are only 8 people to look after don't forget the cheese plate. Nice touch though advising BC that the forward bathroom was to be opened to the main cabin after the main meal service.

I booked the flight ex Sydney to Melbourne via virgin Australia domestic. Due to the issues in Sydney airport so many airlines cancelled the flights. Other airlines like Qantas and Jetstar provided the accommodation to their clients and gave them compensation. Virgin just informed their clients that everything was out of control the only thing you can get from virgin Australia is only words "sorry virgin can not do anything to help you you need to ring to rebook the flight by yourself! No more Virgin for me and my family.

VA 4135 22nd Sept. Denpasar Bali to Perth WA. Awful staff delayed check-in delayed on tarmac for an hour no water offered absolutely shocking food the worst airline I've flown with. I was expecting much better from Virgin! I've never had a reason to write an airline review but I sure felt the need after the experience we had. There is so much more to tell but I've emailed Virgin direct regarding the situation of a drunk passenger in the Exit Row who was obviously unfit to sit there but who staff did nothing about but to tell us we were unfit to sit in the Exit row because of our concerns about this passenger. It was a joke the whole experience. Never will I fly with Virgin again.

VA696 on A330. PER-MEL. Virgin Australia leaves a great first impression for me as this is the first time I have flown them as VA instead of their low-cost forerunner DJ (Virgin Blue). Flight departed on-time and arrived at the destination 30-40 minutes early. Customer service manager made in-flight announcements with passion and clarity. Cabin crews were also friendly. The IFE had an extensive catalogue of music but not so with movies. Furthermore a 3.5mm jack in-ear headphones was provided instead of the usual ones with two jacks. The sound only came from one side of the headphones. This coast to coast flight offered a complimentary hot meal and it was a choice between chicken casserole or Thai green curry. Overall the flight was very pleasant and I would fly with VA again.

### Virgin Australia customer review
Melbourne-Bali return in September. Probably won't use them again internationally. Flight leaving Melbourne was very delayed boarding. The flight was then delayed in departing by an hour - we sat on the tarmac for that time in a hot stuffy aircraft because 6 people had to have their luggage removed. Whilst the pilot was apologetic about this we were not offered any refreshments while we waited and the crew seemed to care less about passengers irritation at the delay. Check in itself at Melbourne airport was an exercise in inefficiency. 4 check in staff allocated to economy class passengers but with 4 international flights being checked in all at the same time the wait to check in was well over one hour. Very poor. The lady who checked me in appeared to be unsure about procedures and had to refer to her supervisor standing behind her. No ability to check in online either so check in was time consuming. I received a txt from Virgin before the flight saying that the wireless inflight entertainment would be available on my flight so I downloaded the app in anticipation - but the IFE did not work on the plane - the stewardess told me so when I asked. No apology from the captain or the head stewardess. It was a long boring flight up to Bali with no entertainment options and hungry passengers who expected to be able to purchase some snacks or food on board but there was nothing available for purchase. The meal was not served until 1pm (4 hours after the flight was scheduled to depart) - with nothing provided earlier in the flight other than a drink and with only 2 meal options one of which they ran out of early on. Why not have snacks available for purchase on flights of this length. Coming back on the redeye at 10.10pm was slightly better as the meal was served promptly departure was relatively on time and the IFE worked. Check in at Denpasar airport in Bali was a shambles. Virgin insist on your arriving at the airports to check in at least 3 hours' prior to departure time they do not have ground crew available to check you in until 2 hrs 50 mins prior to your flight. Long queues eventuated as a result. Check in was slightly quicker than in Melbourne however. Seats on the planes were comfortable but Virgin should be ashamed of using such small planes on these flights. There were only 2 toilets available at the rear of the plane to economy class passengers (there was one at the front but the crew refused to allow even "desperate" passengers to use this saying it was for business class passengers. There were ridiculous queues for the toilets as a result. The crew on both flights were generally not particularly friendly or helpful. Virgin used to be much better - what has happened?

### Virgin Australia customer review
WLG-BNE-POM-BNE-WLG. I've have been traveling VA when I go to PNG because I have no other choice. My experiences with them say they are always looking for ways to improve. The food choice is not as good bland sandwiches however the pies are only served on certain flights. AUD and NZD currency are both used and credit/visa card facilities are available. Beverages such as tea coffee and water are free. I'd recommend paying for food in advance as they have choices for you and they would serve you first before others who would purchase their food onboard. I don't find the food expensive but that's my opinion others opinions may differ. Entertainment is always good during my flights. Their movies and shows etc are always updated however no entertainment between BNE-POM. I find boarding flights in NZ takes so long however boarding flights from BNE-POM are always quicker and vice versa. I once cause the flight from POM-BNE to delay 20mins and as a result my connecting flight was delayed as well. I was then escorted to my next gate by ground staff. VA has lovely friendly and attentive staff. I find the planes between NZ- AUST are older and planes between AUST-PNG are nicer and newer. You can pretty much change seats during flights if you want to. The airline is very informative and take-off and landing have always been excellent! I would definitely recommend flying with VA.

Flown to Los Angeles and back to Sydney in September with Virgin. Overall experience was below average. It had the smallest meal trays I have seen with plastic cutlery which I found to be very poor. The menu was announced on the speaker which I found surprising and was extremely difficult to understand. When asked crew for a kids menu it appeared a big deal or didn't exist most other airlines provide a small kids toy or coloring without asking. Meals were below average entertainment was ok. I hate stick in your ear headphones unlike most airlines which have proper headphones. I believe for the cost of the airline service could have been better.

Flying from Melbourne to Sydney. Checked in online and still the line for the bag drop was over 40 mins. The staff at the counters are so slow and there are often a few of them standing around chatting even though there are huge lines. Eventually got my bags checked in and made it to my flight just in time. I paid extra for my return ticket from Sydney to Melbourne to be flexible. So when I turned up at Sydney airport for my return flight at 12 midday I assumed I'd be able to change to an earlier flight than my existing 5pm. But no all flights were fully booked so I had to wait at the airport for 5 hours. Was a waste of money buying a flexible ticket. They had spare seats in business class but would not let me have one. Will never fly Virgin again.

My experience was very similar to J Corby's having to get a cold bus due to bad weather had to pay for our tea no time for breakfast or shower next morning as got wake up call at 4am had to find our own way to airport. We should have received food vouchers had to pay a nights accommodation at our motel for a night we did not use. Every other trip with Virgin were great I know there is no control over the weather but I think we should have got food vouchers.

This airport really needs to lift its standard. Overall another very good flight with VA.

Brisbane to LA and back Sep 13 and can only describe the service as poor. The majority of the crew are young and very unhelpful. The food is appalling especially when you sit at rear of plane and are unable to choose what you like. The drink service is poor and on a 13 hour flight if you want a drink you go looking for them they don't come to you. I asked one stewardess for a beer whilst she was serving tea and coffee and was quite rudely told 'No Later'. Had one beer in 13 hours. Been to the US 3 times 1st and last time on Virgin. Inflight entertainment was good seats bit hard but bearable.

SYD-LAX. Staff didn't look properly trained but they were nice and funny! My food was excellent especially the desert! I had upgraded the day before and it was great! We got headsets more recline more legroom. A tidy and good looking cabin! Thanks a lot Virgin Australia!

### Virgin Australia customer review
Melbourne - Canberra. Excellent service on an E190. Check in staff were particularly helpful and friendly and allowed me a free of charge last minute change when I told them that I had come from Europe at 04.30. (I had a non refundable non changeable ticket) I had left glasses on the previous flight and they were prepared to change back if that was what I needed to recover the glasses free of charge. The flight left on time and landed about 10 minutes early. I had seat 3A so had plenty of legroom. They managed to serve a basic snack and for such a short flight there was no inflight entertainment (this was as expected). The seat was comfortable and passengers were disembarked quickly. Despite being one of the first off the plane my luggage was waiting for me on the carousal. All in all an excellent experience from check in to luggage collection.

MEL-SYD return. 737-800 aircraft which were clean and tidy. Flight to Sydney left right on time and the aircraft featured the new wi-fi entertainment system which worked brilliantly on my IPad. Had pre-booked seat 3D in the front row of economy so plenty of leg-room and enjoyed a Luke Mangan sandwich which was very good. Return flight was delayed due late arrival of aircraft from Melbourne and the staff kept us well informed as to the new departure time. Sydney can be chaotic and we actually took off 1 hour behind schedule after sitting on the taxi- way for a good 20 mins however flight crew kept us informed as to where we were in the queue for take-off. Served a salad and water which were very good and landed nearly 50 mins later than scheduled. Overall very good flights!

BNE-MEL return 11 and 14 Sep on 737-800. Both flights were excellent (slight take off delay in BNE due to air traffic build up). Flight down good service friendly smiles and personal AVOD. Everyone in good spirits and very friendly. Strange that on return no AVOD or iPods offered no big deal but thought it was same plane configuration. Return trip was fabulous. FA's heard it was my birthday and made a fuss. Flight left and arrived on time - clean and tidy plane comfortable seats and leg room OK on these short flights. Am heading to Hobart soon via Virgin. Stars for Entertainment could not be scored higher as there was none on the return leg.

We flew on 4th September left Brisbane at 7.25am flying direct to Queenstown NZ. We booked a direct flight as flying with a 6 and 7 year old can be challenging expecting to land at 1pm. With weather becoming a problem when landing we were diverted to Christchurch. Thinking at this stage we would refuel (as the pilot said fuel was low) and attempt landing later as we were informed that planes were landing only 1 hour after. Virgin put the passengers on what was like a school bus for 7 hours and drove to Queenstown. Conditions were poor as weather was not any better. The bus was cold no food was offered we had 1 stop and could only get small amounts of food. Which was at our expense also a taxi to our apartment at our expense. Arrived in our apartment at 10pm that night. Would never fly with Virgin again.

### Virgin Australia customer review
Arrived back from Bali to Brisbane 13 September 2013 on VA 4198. Honestly the cabin crew made this the flight from hell. From the surly looks all night to the announcement that Passport Control Arrival Cards will be distributed shortly - the cards that never came to the never ending line of 240 people going to the only two toilets available in economy class - I've had it with Virgin. If you run out of arrival cards make another announcement that you made a mistake and didn't collect enough of them when you left Brisbane. When a passenger asks "I didn't receive the card" don't blame the people of Bali "We asked for more but Bali wouldn't give us any". Pick up your act Virgin Australia nobody likes night shift smile you're lucky it's only a short flight.

### Virgin Australia customer review
BNE-DPS. Cabin crew were rude. Hired Ipads were useless as the headphones didn't really work so you couldn't hear a thing. Staff only interested in Business customers. Couldn't get a drink of water or purchase bottled water I had to ask a few times to refill my cup of water and the crews seemed really annoyed that I asked for a few refills so I ended up going to thirsty for the last few hours of the trip. Lines to the toilets went half way up the cabin as there is only two toilets on the aircraft which is a disaster if your traveling with little kids and unsympathetic and rude cabin crew. You do get a meal on board which is good but if your a vegetarian it's first in best dressed. I'd say take your own water food and entertainment on board. The crew are incredibly rude but if you don't need to ask anything of them you should be fine. It's a cheap flight you get what you pay for I guess.

### Virgin Australia customer review
Melbourne - Phuket via Perth flying Business class. What a rip off! In saying that though the Melbourne to Perth leg was excellent. No complaints at all. Everything a business class should be. Perth to Phuket was horrible. There was nothing business class about it. The seats had no leg rests and the recline was minimal. The food was average and this was the first time we have ever been on a business class flight without champagne! It must also be pointed out that the entertainment system was useless. Not only was the movie selection poor but it was impossible to watch a movie because the audio was so poor.

### Virgin Australia customer review
Went on a 2 day business trip from Melbourne to Adelaide and back to Melbourne and flew VA's 737-800 services. The crew on both sectors were excellent. Aircraft interiors are comfortable and the mood lighting is relaxed and easy on the eye. Both departures and arrivals were on time and with informative and up to date announcements from the cockpit. I have more interstate travel to the west over the coming weeks and will definitely return to VA. Well Done.

### Virgin Australia customer review
My wife and I flew return economy from Melbourne to Auckland in August 2013. Very comfortable and clean aircraft. More legroom then Qantas or Jetstar. Staff were friendly and helpful throughout the flight. Check in was easy with no issues at either Melbourne or Auckland.

### Virgin Australia customer review
On 6 August 2013 Virgin Australia experienced their second major system malfunction in four weeks. I was flying for work and had two flights cancelled meaning I hung around at the airport about 4 hours eventually having to take a flight the next morning. Being stuck overnight away from home Virgin Australia refused to book me a hotel or give me vouchers for a taxi to get to a place to stay. They told me to my face 'you are not a highly valued customer'. When I asked if I did not matter at all the member of ground staff told me that she didn't know how to explain their policy. The loss of about 6 hours of my time should have been avoidable. The booking system had gone down surely a major airline should have an efficient backup - but no they don't. They really don't seem to care about their customers at all. Avoid if possible.

### Virgin Australia customer review
We have travelled with Virgin domestic extensively but last week chose to travel Brisbane to Auckland. Did not realise that unlike domestic fare structure is different. Saver means just that. 7kg carry-on. No food on the haul across the Tasman. We were offered tea/coffee. We were told there was no food to purchase. My husband is a diabetic and it was fortunate that we had pre-purchased a sandwich at the airport due to delay in embarking. Left home 9am for flight 12.30. Lift-off was late and arrival a little late. 9 hours with just a pre-purchased sandwich between us. To put it bluntly this did not leave a good taste in our mouths. During the previous 3 months we had travelled extensively with Emirates and British Airways and were always fed and watered whether a couple of hours in the air or longer. There was always food to purchase. Come on Virgin - you can do better than that across the Tasman.

Melbourne - Hobart & vv. On the outward journey the E190 operated about 30 mins late and the return B737 operated on time. The departure gate in Melbourne was changed but passengers in the original lounge were not notified until 10 mins before boarding time. Otherwise the flights were smooth. Both seats were comfortable and the crews were pleasant.

### Virgin Australia customer review
Flew from Sydney to Nadi (Fiji). The flight left on time and arrived on time. Cabin crew were excellent tablets were available for added cost and had good choice of TV shows/movies. Seats were comfortable and complimentary head seats were given. In my humble opinion virgin is the preferred choice of airline especially for short international to the pacific and domestic.

### Virgin Australia customer review
I recently flew return with Virgin to Denpasar cost was definitely not cut rate but service and their flight offer was very low rate! Not impressed at all no in flight entertainment available for purchase or otherwise-was told they are doing a trial on in-flight entertainment (ie must mean none). Staff were very focused on the few business class passengers but we got stilted dis-interested service. On my return flight which was in the night meal was stodgy beef and not enough water offered-saw crew busy dosing with eye masks on. Will never willingly fly Virgin again!

### Virgin Australia customer review
MEL-BNE-MEL. Both flights on 737 aircraft which were clean and well presented. MEL-BNE delayed slightly due late arrival of aircraft from Brisbane but they turned it around very quickly and we left around 20 mins late. Was assigned seat 3A with plenty of leg-room. Was on a felxi-fare so was offered a sandwich and water. For return flight used one of my upgrades as was assigned seat 1A. Service was outstanding with excellent food and seating. Cabin crew were on the ball for the whole flight. 2 areas which do need addressing. The Virgin lounge in Brisbane was full to overflowing but the dress standards of some of the people leave a lot to be desired. At times I felt I was in a portable building at a building site!! And the silly earpieces which are provided with the Samsung tablet are virtually useless they need better earpieces of noise-cancelling headsets. Next time I will bring my own. Overall a great couple of flights.

### Virgin Australia customer review
Sydney to Perth and onto Phuket via business class. Plane and flight to Perth was very good food and service excellent and seat very good. From Perth to Phuket may as well have gone with an upgraded economy seat on Air Asia and saved money. Seats are small no business area just a rod across the seats. Service ok food average. Return was the same with exception that the flight was cancelled with little notice and no help whatsoever to find accommodation or rebook anything. On the way home small plane to Perth then big one so Sydney 9 passengers and ran out of entrees no inflight TV screens worked in business class. Overall wasted money in this class.

### Virgin Australia customer review
Sydney to Los Angeles on 22nd July 2013 with my wife and 10 year old son who has Downs Syndrome. We were seated in seats 43 AB and C. The check in procedure was fantastic and the flight left on time. We were served a round of refreshments and soon after that dinner. The two choices were both tasty and filling. We asked for a child's meal for my son and even though we had not pre-ordered it were given one. While it didn't look very appetizing (and my son is very fussy) he ate it all without complaint. The in-flight entertainment was fantastic and kept us all occupied. The seats were adequate and we were content. Despite our itinerary showing only dinner served on the flight we were served snacks (chicken/egg wraps) midway through the trip and they were delicious. The snack bar was well stocked with soft drinks and chips for those wishing for a nibble en route. 2 hours before landing we were served with breakfast which was again tasty and filling. The cabin crew were extremely helpful all the way through and helped make the flight a real pleasure. The flight arrived early and we were totally satisfied with our experience. Will always choose Virgin Australia for our future flights.

Melbourne-Bali. Melbourne - departure lounge in some kind of garage at end of airport down 2 floors doors open straight onto tarmac. freezing cold windy room then buses to plane. In Bali similar everyone milling around on tarmac unsupervised with small children everywhere no footpath signage trucks moving around whilst we all waiting for bus to plane. No inflight entertainment. I didn't mind but the number of kids on board could have really used it. No online check-in available so couldn't choose seats return flight meant crammed down back amongst the screaming children on a night flight amongst the long queue of people trying to use the bathrooms Crowded flight - small plane with only one central aisle not enough staff. Drinks service took over 2 hours in the aisle. Over 2 hours to get a water. Seats barely reclined and no footrests. Small food a veg pasta was drowned in thick creamy sauce. A veg curry was very tasteless. The last security check at Bali meant that a bottle of water could not be purchased in the airport as no shops past last security so the really long waits to get a (small) cup of water made the flight even more uncomfortable. Staff seemed pressured. For the prices you get basic cut price services.

### Virgin Australia customer review
Sydney-Perth Saturday afternoon service. Unfortunately the weekend flights use the older aircraft and not the new Airbus A330s with lie flat seats. Cabin manager is assigned to business class only (4 passengers) and was attentive upon boarding hanging my jacket and offering beverages with a choice of water or a mocktail there was no champagne or sparkling to be seen. After take off we were offered beverages and our meal orders were taken. The samsung in flight entertainment systems were handed out however after looking through the selection I instantly regretted not bringing my own laptop as the selection for a 5hr flight was extremely poor. The 3 course meal was delicious and service was good for most of the flight however I had to wait for the bathroom twice the first time as several economy passengers were using the designated business class bathroom and the second time as 4 members of the crew were talking in the front of the cabin blocking the way. After waiting 15 minutes for them to disburse I stepped through the curtain only to be told that I couldn't be up there and to return to my seat. A few minutes later I was approached by the cabin manager to explain that the first officer was coming out of the cockpit and that is why I was told to return to my seat. I wasn't happy with how they handled the situation. The amenities kit was good however it was not handed out until half way through the flight. Overall it was a pretty disappointing the best part of the trip was the priority baggage.

### Virgin Australia customer review
Travelled MEL to Bali recently wife and myself separated by aisle both ways even though spare seats together - nobody cared less. No entertainment of any sort not even music. Coming home small meal and drink of water not one more cold or hot drink offered for the remainder of the flight. Saw one cabin attendant during the next 4.5 hours except up in business class two were asleep laying down at rear of the aircraft. The worst flying experience in 30 years.

### Virgin Australia customer review
MEL-PER in business Class - my first time on Virgin and not my last an exceptional flight. With just five in Business Class we were treated like royalty on this plane that was literally a month old. The staff were well trained friendly and very engaged. The Luke Mangan menu was just divine and the FA's had extensive knowledge of food and wine pairings. Nice little touches like a well stocked amenity kit noise cancelling headphones comfortable and well designed seats and an extensive wine list made me not want to get off the flight. The IFE had a good selection of international and Australian films and TV. One of my best in flight experiences.

My wife and I have just flown to Apia and back on VA operating for Virgin Samoa. Both aircraft's were older Boeing 737-800 in fine order. Cabin and toilets excellent and friendly flight attendants. Good inflight magazine and portable video/music players were available with a small selection of movies and music. Flights left on time. Meal both ways was a beef wrap. For a four hour flight these were good flights.

Flew SYD to Brisbane and back. Both flights very good. Modern clean aircraft with professional crews. On way back from BNE I arrived at airport 2 hours before my flight and at check in was asked if I wished to move to an earlier flight. Nice touch.

### Virgin Australia customer review
Plane and Crew acceptable - however I was delayed by 5 hours in leaving on a 2 hour trip - even though there were 4 flights ahead which I could of been moved to. These people put the already booked plane to the end of the queue! Absolutely frustrating and I would not recommend this service.

### Virgin Australia customer review
SYD to AUH (VA 29) 13 June 2013. Mixed feelings about this flight - while the food and IFE was excellent the service from the flight attendants was horrible to say the least. On a number of occasions they would shout at customers and other times not respond to requests (like a glass of water). Virgin Australia seriously needs to manage their staff better because they are sure to lose a lot of passengers if they continue at this rate.

### Virgin Australia customer review
Flew Sydney to Denpasar July 1. After flying Jetstar last time we found Virgin far superior. Particularly appreciated the free meal and free alcohol which is new policy. Being 737 did mean only toilets at the rear of plane which meant you had to pick your times. The crew were polite and helpful. Can't comment on inflight entertainment because we took our own and didn't notice any other. Would definitely fly Virgin again.

Flight from Sydney to Melbourne which had been booked for months cancelled on the day of the flight. Passenger put on another flight one and a half hours later which arrived in Melbourne at 11.05pm causing much inconvenience.

### Virgin Australia customer review
Flew to Bali (Denpasar) on DJ4197 from Brisbane (return) in mid June 2013. Airplane was a Boeing 737-800 quite new and consisted of economy seats and a handful of Premium Economy seats (separated by a tinted half-wall and rope). Flight left on time. Good points were the service and friendliness of staff and the food was actually quite good. Ticket didn't include any pre-paid meals but everyone on board got complimentary hot lunch which was appreciated. No bottles of water were served but staff were happy to provide re-fills or sealed 100ml tubs. Flight time was supposed to be 6.5 hours but we were forced to circle Bali airport for another hour due to traffic congestion. In Flight Entertainment wasn't available. I thought this was very poor. No blankets available either. Virgin is using a domestic plane (B737-800) which is designed for short 2-3 hour flights for an international flight. Plane was very cramped and hardly any leg room for someone of my height (1.8 m). The layout was 3 seats each side with two toilets at the back for economy which is not enough when the plane was full. Our seats were in Row 10 which was fine. At least Virgin's flights to Bali are direct which is why we chose them. Overall 5/10 I wouldn't be in a rush to fly with VA again to Bali.

### Virgin Australia customer review
MEL to Bali. Plane flight and cabin crew all good. Entertainment was zero - no movies no screens no radio. Luckily had an ipads ready pre-loaded. Biggest Issue - Food and drinks. Or lack thereof. Whole family starving so whilst waiting for main meal we wanted to order from the Virgin inflight menu which was poor but we were hungry and happy to pay for the limited morsels on the menu. However there was no food to be ordered. After a long wait the main finally arrived which was fine. The price of the flight was not cheap and it's a 6 hour flight so I think Virgin are skating on thin ice here and should at least warn customers of what to expect.

### Virgin Australia customer review
BNE-HTI in a 737-800 the aircraft was very clean and tidy. The staff were friendly. I sat in Row 3 (which is a bulkhead seat) and had more than enough legroom. Virgin Australia's major failing is the lack of In-Flight Entertainment onboard their 737s. The lack of In-Flight entertainment wouldn't matter on a short flight (Canberra- Sydney) but on a 2 hour flight it is a bit ridiculous. I would recommend bringing an iPad or Laptop with movies on if you want to watch movies. We were offered a sandwich and a biscuit for lunch which was very very plain. The seat was comfortable though it did appear that the bottom cushion had completely separated from the back portion of the seat. The head rest was very comfortable and the leather was a nice touch. I would recommend them but make sure that you bring your own entertainment if you're flying on their 737s.

### Virgin Australia customer review
DJ 714 Perth to Adelaide and DJ 717 Adelaide to Perth early December 2012. Service was brilliant. Staff were apologetic about the plane. Aircraft was a Embraer E190 aircraft. I feel that this plane with no IFE is unsuitable for the long flight Perth - Adelaide and back. I've just booked my next flight to Adelaide return but with another airline that uses aircraft with IFE on this run. Once bitten twice shy. I wouldn't recommend this run on this airline.

SYD-PER return. Newer A330 have great seats that lie flat (on an angle) and VOD. Older A330 seats don't lie flat still reasonably comfortable and no VOD.

SYD-LAX return in J class as part of a business trip to Vegas and San Diego. Onward connections with Delta in the US. Personally I can't fault Virgin's J product other than the rows of seats not being quite as private as some other airlines. Etihad does this much better with the private seats which for a solo traveller is a nicer experience. Great IFE fantastic food and the service as always is superb. Watch out for the self service bar though it made for a rough morning arriving in LAX. I really think that as far as value for money you can't beat their J product for crossing the Pacific.

### Virgin Australia customer review
SYD TO DPS (Bali) a few day ago. I was mortified that there was no inflight entertainment. Appalling considering the cost of the flight. The staff are becoming 'too cool for school' which is a real put off. The reason I left my frequent flyer and switched from using Qantas over to VA was because they were much more professionally casual staff and their pricing was competitive. Not only did the flight have no entertainment it was like a cool room in the cabin no pillows or blankets and the food that was served was tiny! I'm now considering going back over to Qantas to give them another go at least they offer entertainment have a lounge at Sydney Intl and serve spirits whilst providing blankets / pillows. Virgin Australia you need to look at your international flights like Bali and offer a better device.

### Virgin Australia customer review
Flew SYD-PER A330-200 on a business class points upgrade. Was well looked after by FA's who were professional and courteous without being in your face. The Luke Mangan menu is superb and of a very high quality whilst the drink service was outstanding. IFE more than adequate for the trip and I hope VA can maintain the level of service and enthusiasm from the staff delivering the product.

### Virgin Australia customer review
PER-MEL VA677 24th June. Older A332. Aircraft interior very old and tired for a competitive airline IFE was a joke with half the 15 channels not working and the system stopping completely despite the gushing announcement that "the entertainment will continue until we reach the gate". Such an old interior is completely unacceptable to standards expected nowadays and the whole experience was a throw back to the 90's. Food portions very small. Virgin Lounge in Melbourne very nice although lack of equipment meant long lines. With such glaring oversights the whole experience just felt very 'basic' when prices are almost comparable I will have to throw my support behind Qantas again as at least I can be assured of a consistent product quality.

### Virgin Australia customer review
I took a group of 30 high-school students from BNE to LAX with Virgin and was impressed with their service from beginning to end. Check-in was a breeze thanks to their very competent staff and the flight was smooth and comfortable with great IFE to occupy 30 teenagers. They even got our special meal requests perfect every time. Great service from a very friendly and competent VA team.

### Virgin Australia customer review
25 May SYD-AUH Economy Class. Virgin Australia is slipping already just 4 or 5 years into its re-launch. Catering seemed a little on the cheap side with small meals and limited snacks. Simple things like no pretzels with your drink and only chips available during the night. Crew were polite but service seemed very slow. Crew seemed very busy and it took almost three hours for our lunch to be cleared away. Entertainment system is easy to use but the variety of tv shows and movies is very poor. I noticed one or two French passengers around me were complaining that they did not have French movies or subtitles. The crew were nice but you could tell they were very busy. There was a group of Italian passengers on the flight and none could speak English and there were no crew who spoke Italian any other languages so was a struggle for them.

We just flew from Perth to Melbourne. Service was excellent seats comfortable plane immaculate and the food was very good. So impressed that we seriously are considering only flying with Virgin in the future. Keep up the good work!

### Virgin Australia customer review
May 2013 I travelled by Virgin/Etihad from Sydney to Heathrow via Abu Dhabi. As a 77 year old woman travelling alone I bought Premium Economy for the longer Virgin flights. The seats were wider and a bit further apart than Etihad Economy but not really worth the extra money. The worst part of the trip was the queue for boarding passes at Abu Dhabi on the return journey on 1 June. I was given passes for both outward legs in Sydney. On the return trip my Virgin pass wasn't available at the Heathrow Etihad check-in so I had to join a queue of about 200 Virgin passengers in Abu Dhabi being serviced by one man at one computer. After standing for 45 minutes I felt quite unwell and had to ask for assistance and a seat. Other passengers were standing for over an hour. I don't know whose responsibility it is to issue boarding passes but there must be a better system.

MEL-CBR. Flew on an Embraer 190 which is one of the best aircraft's in VA's fleet. Check in excellent and was seated in 3C in front row of economy. Flight left on time and crew were very thorough in their pre-flight checks. Once airborne offered cheese and biscuits with bottled water. Landed ahead of schedule in Canberra and luggage delivered promptly. Canberra airport is still undergoing works but is very passenger friendly.

Sydney to Bali on a 737-800. Learnt on this trip there is no industry standard on what an airline can classify as Business. The seats are a joke. Not even a foot rest. The longest six hours of my life. Staff were friendly and the food was ok but for comfort give this one a miss.

### Virgin Australia customer review
We flew PER-HKT-PER. Seats comfortable and spacious (I am quite tall and found the legroom to be very generous). Complimentary meals and snacks received on both legs. My husband was ill on the HKT-PER flight and although there was a full plane the crew did everything possible to make him feel comfortable. Will definitely fly with them again.

Sydney - Los Angeles and found it to be the best international flight I've taken. I am not the best flyer but a flight attendant was more than happy to come and speak to me to calm my nerves. Flight attendants friendly the plane itself was modern and spacious. Inflight entertainment was great and I never felt hungry as we received 2 meals and snacks whenever we needed them. I would definitely fly Virgin in the future.

### Virgin Australia customer review
SYD to LAX and return. VA1 and VA2. First flight seated near rear of plane had 3 seats to myself. After having a very nice meal served with a nice white wine by even nicer flight attendants. I waited for what I considered to be an appropriate period of time for another passenger to move into one of the spare seats beside me. However when this failed to happen I felt it only reasonable that I spread myself around and with my 3 pillows and blanket lay down and get a nice nap for about 9 hours. Return flight had an aisle seat with a spare beside me and was able to get some sleep which I usually don't do well whilst in an upright seat laid back. Economy seats on VA 777's are one of the better seats around. However there is always room for improvement on any airline seat. Flight attendants were very attentive and ready to give you a smile. All in all I will continue to use Virgin Australia as I can't fault them.

### Virgin Australia customer review
Took return flight from Sydney to Hobart and really enjoyed the trip. The price was very reasonable and the cabin staff were very professional and friendly. Check-in process was quick and easy. I will definitely recommend flying Virgin Australia as the service has improved a lot since my last flight with them in 2011.

### Virgin Australia customer review
SYD-LAX. Poor service had to chase drinks when crew went for their break warm water was left on shelf next to toilets for you to help yourself. Return no better. Again to hydrate during trip water was on shelf next to toilets but was again warm due to being under a light in a confined space. Other airlines at least have the water come through a dispenser not Virgin it is left in a jug for anybody and everybody to help themselves to and breathe and cough all over. Food was very average. Blankets supplied and appreciated as was very cold during flight.

### Virgin Australia customer review
I have flown with them a lot since they launched. Lately however I have noticed a distinct downward spiral in their service levels. I flew SYD–DPS return last week. The flight over is ok as its during the day. Take a book or your own entertainment as they have removed the seat back TVs. There are no ipads available either so its staring at the back of a seat for 6 hours. They do now serve a free meal however it is tiny and looked pretty bad. I opted not to take the meal. The main problem I had was my return flight. It departs at 10.10pm from DPS arriving at 6.10am SYD. Being an overnight flight you would hope that there is a blanket and pillow for you. There wasn't and the flight was freezing. Again no ipads available. Staff were nowhere to be seen and when they were seen were irritable. Service levels need to improve. One last issue was the pilots didn't address the plane at all. Its a small free service which would make a big difference!

Recently took a flight with family (including 4 yr old daughter) from MEL-LAX-MEL. Overall good value for money. Aircraft very clean and IFE good. Above all cabin service was excellent (much better than Qantas I must say) and crew were attentive and helpful. Meals were pretty average airline food and seats were a bit cramped. But I will fly with them again when the situation calls for it.

MEL-BNE front row of economy due Platinum status and was offered breakfast wrap with coffee. Arrived in Brisbane on time and baggage delivered promptly. On return decided to use upgrade and allocated seat 1D for return. Dedicated crew for business passengers welcomed onboard by name and offered juice or water prior to take off. Once underway the service was terrific. Onboard snack was either a warm tart with salad or smoked salmon with fresh fruit. Coffee and tea also offered and water runs wre regular. The entertainment is via tablet - however the earplugs provided aren't up to scratch. Hard to hear the movie and spent some time trying to adjust the earplugs.

Flew ADL-MEL-Gold Coast last weekend Gold Coast-SYD-ADL on the way home. Virgin you need to work on your connecting flights - booked online so I assumed I would have enough time. On the way there 15min delay was assured by flight attendants that I'd have time to make it to the gate - wrong I sprinted from one terminal to the other and they told me the gate had shut. Young lady at the gate got me a flight first thing the next morning and arranged accommodation. On the way back there was a 5min delay and the only reason I made my connecting flight was that the gate was the next one down. Apart from that - seats are a bit rigid but not too bad didn't buy any food or drink.

ATR 72 TSV-CNS. Very nice interior of aircraft but seat was feeling uncomfortable at the end of the 50 minute trip. Was served a snack and choice of cold drinks including water juice beer or wine. Never had anything like that on Virgin Blue.

We travelled on several flights from Sydney to Cairns to Ayers Rock to Melbourne in March 2013. All flights were pretty much on time planes were quite clean and cabin staff pleasant. Drinks and snacks were well served. We booked extra legroom on all these flights and being by the wing exits these also had the advantage of no recline intrusion from the seats in front. Check ins were good and one admin error on one leg was dealt with without a drama. Prices were OK and we'd gladly travel Virgin Australia again.

MEL-ADL-MEL. Quick trip to Adelaide from Melbourne. Embraer 190 on MEL-ADL leg. Great aircraft and staff were terrific. Flight left on time and landed 5 mins early. Flight back to Melbourne was half full and ended up in aisle seat with no one next to me. Again staff were great and served an excellent breakfast with fruit and nuts fresh milk and an apple. Virgin lounge in Adelaide very good with pancakes and juice with fresh fruit.

Travelled with VA as the final leg of an Etihad booked return flight between Sydney and Dublin. The difference between the Etihad flights and the VA flight is immense! Upon boarding the staff are cheery relaxed and friendly. All of your amenities a blanket and a bottle of water are waiting at your seat and they immediately walk through the cabin before take off asking if anyone needed anything else. The plane was comfortable nicely lit temperature was fine food was delicious and the staff passed through the cabin regularly with drinks. There was a small snacks section at the rear of the cabin with plentiful snacks drinks and a water tap. The entertainment system wasn't as vast as Etihad's in terms of choice but everything else about the flight was so pleasant that it really didn't matter. Highly recommend Virgin Australia and the only shame is that they have partnered with Etihad and I will absolutely not fly with Etihad again.

VA813 MEL-SYD 2 April 2013 early morning flight. I was quite impressed with the refurbished Virgin Australia terminal in MEL's T3. My seats were accidentally mixed up during check-in and only 3 check-in counters were available even though there was a substantial queue. I went to the service desk and the friendly gentleman there was happy to switch my seats back with no hassle. The boarding process was smooth and organized and the flight departed on time. Complimentary drinks were provided and the FAs were generous in offering refills to passengers. No personal screens or IFE but I didn't mind since it was a short flight. Overall a pleasant experience will definitely fly VA again in the future.

BNE-SYD-DPS. Flight from Brisbane to Sydney 45 minutes late no one at Virgin transfer desk to assist us had to run to make connection in nick of time. SYD-DPS freezing cabin and no blankets (a very uncomfortable 6 hour flight as a consequence). Food (for which you had to pay) terrible choice between 3 items. Ended up paying $40 for very poor snacks and drinks for two. If you are going to operate as the lowest of the low-cost airlines then please at least be low-cost! No inflight entertainment of any kind as this is 'considered a domestic flight' one of the cabin crew told me. Seats narrow and poor legroom.

### Virgin Australia customer review
Flew MEL-SYD return in Feb. Comfortable seats but nothing else would make me want to fly this airline again. Similar airfare to QF without the food. A budget airline masquerading as a full-service airline.

### Virgin Australia customer review
Premium economy on 02/16/2013 and returned on 03/06/2013. LAX to Brisbane outbound and coming back from Sydney to LAX on board 777. Pros: Newer fleet of planes and onboard entertainment system has a good amount of selection. Ambient lighting inside cabin in nice. Planes are clean. Noise cancelling head phones are effective. Cons: The seat cushions in premium economy even after their recent redesign a few months ago are terrible. My traveling partner and I could not find a comfortable position as the bottom seat cushion have padding that is very hard that does not have any give. I could not sleep inbound or outbound on these overnight flights. On our return flight we purchased some air filled cushions at the airport to try and help the situation but the design on the seat is so poor they helped very little. Food service is the same as economy. Food quality was poor. Inconsistent on-board bag policy. We knew about weight restrictions for checked baggage and followed accordingly. However on our return flight we were asked to placed our on-board luggage on the scale. I have never had another airline weigh our overhead carry-on bags. Service is mediocre. One round of drinks a meal flight attendants walk down the aisles for a glass of wine snack then another meal. No other drinks offered by the flight attendants besides port/brandy at night. The snack bar is just filled with a couple bottles of white/red wine no premium liquors and chips/cookie/popcorn/pretzel bags.

Sydney-Perth. Excellent service found the food delicious and the entertainment system allowed for sufficient choice. The seats were comfortable but best of all the flight attendants - they made you feel welcome and were friendly and efficient.

### Virgin Australia customer review
SYD-NAN return late February/early March. Outgoing flight was operated by a reasonably new 737-800 and was less than half full. The seats were quite comfortable with adjustable headrests. Travelled on a flexi fare which meant that entertainment and food was included. The IFE was ok - the choice of movies was limited but what was available was pretty good (probably worth the $15 if you travel on saver). The food though on both routes was absolutely disgraceful. On the way over I was served with a Luke Mangan egg lettuce and mayonnaise wrap. It tasted disgusting and the label said that it was 5 days old. On the way back it was an egg lettuce and mayo sandwich which I refused to eat. The meal was finished with a cookie and a pack of M&M's. Do not purchase a Flexi Fare! Return flight was operated by an old 737-800 with old and uncomfortable seats. The crew on the flight back were pretty inefficient and rude. Some of them even had a nap in the back row - seemed a bit much for a four and a half hour flight. Virgin Australia is really just a low cost airline and I would only recommend it for one or two hour flights. Based on the quality of the food I definitely would not fly VA to LAX.

### Virgin Australia customer review
Brisbane-Denpasar. I used to fly with Virgin quite often just because it was the only direct flight to Bali from Brisbane and it used to be affordable. But the prices have raised and the quality is still the same. Their flights are often delayed and there is never any compensation. Food on the plane is expensive and disgusting. The worst is the staff. They come around with drinks once or twice during a 6hrs flight and the rest of the time they are asleep or watching movies. There is no entertainment on the plane. They charge the surfboard (5kg) as a 23kg bag (it has been changed recently after many complaints). Before they were at least cheap. Now the flight to Bali is quite similar in price to Singapore airlines. So never again.

Sydney-Christchurch on 737-800 Premium Economy. Boarding was friendly and quick using priority lane priority pass given for immigration. Use of Koru lounge in Sydney good offerings friendly staff although lounge is really starting to show its age. Boarding was fast and organised. Aircraft was painted in Pacific Blue colours but was refitted inside with the new Virgin Australia scheme. Premium Economy seating was roomy. The cabin supervisor greeted me by name and sat down and explained services and catering I was very impressed and chose what I wanted and at what times. Flight was great inflight entertainment was a portable player but I declined as had my own tablet. Cabin staff were excellent and I could not fault them. This flight was excellent and highly recommended.

Brisbane to Perth. This is a 5 + hour flight and absolutely no in-flight entertainment available at all. Luckily I had my book. Meal was served as its a 5+ hr flight and food ok. Flight on time.

### Virgin Australia customer review
Midday flight from Sydney to Melbourne. No queue to drop our bags off which was great. Flights times kept changing until we started boarding 45 minutes after scheduled time. Boarding slow and painful due to the lack of staff and the process in which they board the plane. I thought the staff were nice. Business class is separated from economy by a sheet of tinted glass. Real business class service such as Qantas would have curtains and solid wall to separate business class which I much prefer. Since I am over 6ft tall I won't complain about the leg room. Food served quickly after take off. Food is expensive on Virgin and I just went for the free coffee. Unlike the new 737-800s this old aircraft still have television screens on the back of seats. Some channels are still available to watch and it kept me occupied until we got to Melbourne. When we landed we walked out the back and went into the terminal to get our luggage. Virgin need to catch up in customer service.

### Virgin Australia customer review
Sydney-Hobart-Sydney on 737-800 and E190. A mixed bag. I can't quite figure out VA. Aircraft's are modern and the refurbished interior including seats look and feel great. Plenty of legroom. The 737 had the old "live2air" seatback entertainment. The E190 had no entertainment. Food was only available to purchase on these flights but if I was travelling from Sydney to Canberra or within WA some snacks are complimentary. My return flight departed on a Tuesday at 5pm and beer and wine are offered complimentary between 4pm and 7pm - but only between mainland capitol cities. Overall I don't mind flying VA but it would be good if they could create some consistency in their product.

### Virgin Australia customer review
Melbourne-Hobart-Melbourne in Economy. Had only carry-on bags and checked in online so we were able to bypass the horrendous queues at Melbourne Airport. Flights were 45 and 30 minutes late departing Melbourne and Hobart respectively and there weren't any updates - either to the departure gate display boards or by way of public announcements - to waiting passengers at either airport resulting in many people approaching the departure desks to query staff. During both flights flight crew apologised for the late departure which was said to be due to 'delays with incoming aircraft'. Apart from those aspects the flights were satisfactory; very clean aircraft comfortable seating and friendly and competent cabin staff. There isn't a great range of snacks on these mid-morning flights but what is available is likely to be sufficient for most passengers given there's only about an hour's flying time in each direction.

Sydney to Bali Bali to Sydney. Very poor service unfriendly staff no radio or TV on board food is not included and what is offered for additional charge is of a very low standard. On the way from Bali we were stuck at the airport because there was no information of the board about check in counter or gate number. We were waiting 1.5 hours and only after asking someone (no information desk) we were referred to counters 53 to 57 where Virgin normally does its check in. After going there we found that the check in was almost completed. We were the last couple in the queue although we arrived at the airport 2.5 hours in advance. Staff on the plane were unfriendly we were sitting at the back of the plane with a few vacant rows behind us. I have requested a flight attendant to let me occupy a row behind us so we could stretch and sleep through overnight flight. She said that she would let me know. However other passengers and crew members occupied those rows and I never was allowed to go there. It was freezing cold on the plane but no blankets were offered to the passengers although all crew members had their jumpers and blankets on. I would never fly again with Virgin and would never recommend it to other people.

### Virgin Australia customer review
My daughter and myself recently traveled to Bali on 29/01/13. I was very disappointed in the service we received. The flight was not full quite a few empty seats. The cabin crew only came through once to offer refreshments and anything else we may have required we had to use our buzzer to gain their attention. Seeing it was a 6 hour flight I assumed we would have had better service. At one point I did enquire if they had any paracetamol available the flight attendant said yes and went to get them but she never returned. I feel we were an inconvenience to them rather than part of their job. Very disappointing.

### Virgin Australia customer review
First time travelling in business class on a flight from MEL to MCY. Cabin supervisor was polite very approachable and looked after the needs of all in business. Nothing was too much trouble for any of the crew members. Comfortable seats great spread of food and endless drinks. The Samsung player was good. First one was low on battery but was quickly replaced. Headphones were of sufficient standard. However I did end up swapping for my own personal set. Always a pleasure to travel with Virgin Australia.

Arrived at Sydney Airport for our flight to Townsville 1.5 hours before our flight departure time and joined the most horrendous queue that snaked almost out the door. Absolute chaos in the terminal and people just making up lines ad hoc. We stood and waited. We had a 10.05 am flight and at 9.40am we still had at least 15 people ahead of us in the queue. Listened for announcements regarding our flight - nothing. Finally I pushed my way to the front of the line in order to flag a passing Virgin staff member who was milling around. She ushered my husband and I to a counter had a quick check on her screen and said 'Nope you've missed that flight you should have checked in by now'! She tried to tell us that there were numerous announcements for passengers flying to Townsville to approach one of the end counters. We demanded to speak to the supervisor on duty she eventually conceded that sometimes when they are 'experiencing high passenger volumes' that some things (like relevant PA announcements about flights) can be overlooked! We got put on another flight via Brisbane and were given $60 in meal vouchers of which we used $16 on the flight to buy a couple of cans of drink and some chips - not much else available! Don't just stand in line assuming that Virgin will let you know what is going on. If you can see that time is passing and you are still not checked in go to the head of the queue and ask what is happening otherwise you may have your flight closed too and depending on how booked subsequent flights are you may even get on the next flight.

MEL-DPS on VA4153 02/02/12. Flight time to Bali 5.45. Load factor about 75%. First time flying VA International and was pleasantly surprised. Flight was on a Boeing 737-800 used for domestic flights but it was spacious and comfortable with the new Boeing Sky interior fitted on newer 777's. Traveling in a party of 5 adults and one infant aged 8 months the crew were fantastic with the baby engaging and nothing was too much trouble. Will definitely fly Virgin on International Short Haul again.

Brisbane to Sydney DJ958 on 27/1/2013. Scheduled flight departure 15.00. Flight departure was constantly changed and by 18.00 the flight was cancelled (BNE bad weather). Rebooked on flight VA9842 due to depart at 19.05. Boarded this flight and eventually left the terminal and got as far as to the runway. Aircraft returned back to the terminal again around 22.30 after sitting for 2 hours on the aircraft. I am assuming the real reason for the return was the fact the aircraft would not have made it to Sydney before the 23.00 curfew rather than as claimed the bad weather. No refreshments offered on the aircraft and had to ask for water. After disembarking Virgin staff disappeared. No assistance from anyone and customers were left to fend for themselves.

Never again! LAX-Sydney Connecting flight was slightly late but they gave up my seat to another passenger. Finally got on after extreme protest and onboard was OK. Ground staff at LAX were the most rude I have experienced.

Two excellent flights with VA from Melbourne to Adelaide to Melbourne over Australia Day Weekend. Unfortunately both flights were delayed due to the floods in FNQ but this was not VA's fault. The airline kept us up to date throughout both delays. I was very impressed with the cabin service - the new uniforms look very smart as do the new leather seats. I love the interior colours and the purple perspex separating economy and business class.

Wellington-Brisbane-Denpasar return. Tried to leave Wellington on Monday flight VA0067 to Brisbane on the 21/1/2013. Arrived at the airport at 4 am and was told that the aircraft had broken down as was going to Christchurch to be fixed - advised to wait until the afternoon flight. We didn't get on the afternoon flight and left the following day no apology nothing. Tried to leave Denpasar 27/1/2013 VA 4196 - waited 2 hours in the queue where the computer crashed time and again. The only time that those waiting knew something was when a passenger went onto the Virgin website and discovered that the flight was delayed 6 hours. Ground staff had no idea what was going on and our baggage has never been seen again. Virgin advised they would supply lunch and dinner and it was the same food for both a sandwich rice or noodles. As a result booked into a transit lounge to get away from the hard seats and the hoards of disgruntled passengers. Arrived finally in Brisbane yes there was a storm but again ground staff could not care.

I have flown several times in business class and found the overall quality and level of service acceptable. My business partner has recently flown Brisbane/LA in Premium Economy Class and commented the level of service and seat quality was below average. Shame they stopped the Brisbane-Phuket service that was good.

Travelled to Christchurch on 14th January finally after waiting at the airport from 5am till 7pm. Disruptions were caused by new checking in system and a plane that broke down. We did initially leave a couple of hours late but turned back because of something wrong with the plane. Virgin staff seemed unable to cope when something goes wrong and communication with passengers was almost non existent. After quire a few hours we cancelled our accommodation and booked in at Christchurch also had to contact rental company. All in all a very bad experience and cost us plenty. Perhaps Virgin could look at the checking in system at Christchurch where you book in and print your own boarding pass. Excellent and fast. Suggestions for coping if this happened again would be to train staff in procedures when things go wrong put passengers with no booked luggage on other airlines communicate with passengers and give constant updates.

### Virgin Australia customer review
Cramped seating no room to move - couldn't put tray down when passenger in front reclined - very restricted and uncomfortable. Would be helpful if staff spoke to passengers in this situation and asked that they consider others.

### Virgin Australia customer review
I understand that delays at airports cannot be helped but the way that passengers are treated during the delay certainly can be. Travelled yesterday from Denpasar and the treatment of passengers by the Virgin ground staff and Airport Security was disgusting. Flight was delayed 6 hours and we were held for most of that time in the boarding lounge which was a hot and sticky area with no access to water. No information provided as to what was going on or how long the delay was going to be. People trying to leave the boarding lounge to buy water were prevented by Security Staff. Felt like we were being held almost captive within the boarding lounge and it was only when a few passengers started getting very angry that finally after 4 hours we were given transit cards and allowed out into the main terminal for a drink. I cannot understand why water cannot be made available in the boarding lounge particularly under circumstances such as this. In my experience Denpasar Airport is the only place where water is not made available in boarding lounges even for sale and of course the tap water in the bathroom is not drinkable. The pilot was most apologetic but he was nowhere to be seen during our waiting time on the ground. Once we finally were in the air we were offered a free drink - small compensation I say.

LAX-MEL in April 2011 in Economy. Great experience - seats were wide and comfortable (firm yes but they are designed this way and it works); in flight entertainment is more than adequate (and its your own screen unlike United); the 777 was clean and obviously new. Was in the very last row with an aisle seat which is great because you have extra space to your side. Returned MEL to LAX in April 2012. Unlike in LA the check-in process at MEL was rushed and the customer service agent I worked with was well below average. She had to reprint me baggage tags because she never asked what my final destination was and grumbled when asked to do so. Otherwise another good flight with excellent customer service (one flight attendant was downright rude but this was outweighed by others who were pleasant professional and attentive). The really great thing about V Australia though is that they have less restrictive and cheaper rules for flight changes than Qantas does even if you book with the cheapest possible sale fares.

### Virgin Australia customer review
My wife and I have been using Qantas in the past on a yearly basis to visit our family in Australia. We used V Australia on the last 2 occasions. On our last flight from LAX to Sydney return customer service was horrible. Cabin staff including ground crew were very rude. During the flight when asked for an additional pillow we were told none are left yet later on they were carrying pillows to the back of the plane. The food was horrible and on flight to Sydney we were offered a snack between breakfast and dinner but not on the flight to LAX. The seats were so hard that after few hours it became incredibly uncomfortable. During the flight to Sydney air conditioning was left on at full blast and although both of us were heavily dressed we froze by the time we arrived in Australia.

### Virgin Australia customer review
SYD to AUH in Business seat 1A. Bussiness cabin approximately 20% full. Service pretty good meals solid. IFE good. Seat not as comfortable as previous V Australia Business seats very hard but not so bad on the recline. Lounge access via Air NZ in Sydney was fine. V Australia/Etihad code share is only a touch lower in cost than the Emirates business flights to Europe but I feel V Australia business class from SYD-AUH is a little limp and not exactly great value for money.

### Virgin Australia customer review
Seats although wider than economy were very hard and uncomfortable and the arm rests didn't raise; when the seat in front was reclined it was very difficult to manoeuvre past it. Tray table was small and flimsy. The bar ran out of wine - we were told that it was "basically just the leftovers from business class and there wasn't any more". After the lunch at around 12.30pm there was no food until breakfast just prior to landing in LA - we were told they "didn't stock sandwiches" so there was only chips and nuts etc. Attention from staff was poor.

### Virgin Australia customer review
Business class SYD-LAX. Excellent flight roomy cabin. Lie flat bed. Turn down service a nice touch enhanced by the pyjamas. Food tasty and the option of ordering breakfast selection prior to settling down for the evening was great with breakfast served when at your preferred time. The sit down bar provides a great place to relax. Inflight entertainment is easy to use and provides a good choice of entertainment. The crew provide a professional level of service with a relaxed approach. Only complaint would be the seat which can be hard in the fully upright position. Not having the entertainment screen not located in the seat in front works as it enables the screen position to be adjusted. Overall recommended for long haul product.

### Virgin Australia customer review
Service was second to none with the staff attentive and professional. Premium Economy - the seats were spacious with a good recline and plenty of leg room. The food was tasty and plentiful and the open bar gave you access to snacks and water whenever you felt peckish.

### Virgin Australia customer review
Premium Economy from Sydney to London VA to Abu Dhabi then Etihad Economy class to London. The SYD- AUH leg being 2/3rds of the flight was definitely worth the extra money - particularly the extra backrest angle and legroom was a huge improvement over standard economy. What really lets it down however is a very hard seat cushion - I had to fold a blanket and put that down to make it bearable. Codeshare with Etihad - poor. A real shock to go back to standard economy which is very standard with Etihad their service is rubbish food a joke entertainment system poor - it really was like going back 10 years. I would go V Australia again if the price is a fair bit cheaper than other PE options (which for this case it was) but not if it was the same price.

### Virgin Australia customer review
SYD to LA with my wife. On our return flight from LA the breakfast had run out and crews were forced to make some sort of pancake which was inedible. After a long night of barely any sleep we were hungry and looking forward to breakfast. We went to the US for a 3 weeks holidays and on our return flight we found the entertainment was exactly same as our outbound flight. Considering such a long flight time I think VA should consider updating their entertainment package more regularly. We found some staff were not well trained. For long flights I think more experienced staff should be considered. Overall I think VA is quite overrated based on the service that we had received.

### Virgin Australia customer review

I flew with my two children from Sydney to Abu Dhabi return. The flight over was difficult as my knees pushed into the seat in front. My entertainment system didn't work properly neither did my sons and the man sitting next to me - his didn't work at all. The food was barely edible. Staff were nice and helpful. The return was in a much newer nicer plane. The entertainment system worked well and the seats were much better. The food was genuinely inedible. There was supposed to be some drinks and small packets of chips available for those who couldn't eat the food - there was none.

Premium Eco Melbourne to LA and then picked up the US partner Delta for the LA-New York leg. The VA part was great I'm tall and found there was a good amount of legroom the food was average and the cabin service fine - non intrusive but attentive when needed. VA needs to get rid of Delta as a partner. Rusting plane dirty aircraft cramped seats rude cabin crew who managed to be worse than the ground crew.

### Virgin Australia customer review
My daughter and her boyfriend flew Sydney to LAX - on the return flight they were flying as "family & friends" which meant standby (a standby ticket had been purchased). One expects to not always get on the first flight but they were stranded in LAX at the airport for 8 days! When I called the airline to ask for help in getting them out of LA I was simply told they would have to pay the one way regular fare to get on the plane. At this time one way was anywhere between $1600 - $2100 each - I said they don't have that kind of money the agent just simply said 'well then I guess they should borrow it from someone"! His mother had had enough of this nonsense and used her business points to book them out of LA on QANTAS as I'm sure they would still be stranded in LA. I fly home to Australia on a regular basis and will never be using this airline. That was a perfect example of a company that simply did not care and absolutely has no customer service.

### Virgin Australia customer review
BNE-LAX-BNE. Chose V mainly to avoid the Brisbane-Sydney connection that most airlines wanted to send me on. Flight out leaves mid-morning (10-ish) and 3 hours in they are trying to get you off to sleep - quite bizarre really but plenty of people looked like they were getting some shut-eye - I got none all trip. However I was quite happy to watch and play with the RED entertainment system which was magic - loads of new films doco's games and music. Flight back much better leave midnight quick food service and off to sleep for a few hours at least. Seats on the 777-300 seemed quite wide compared to other planes I have flown internationally. We chose middle section (3 across) so we wouldn't need to climb over strangers to get to the loo. Seat cushions were a little solid to sit on and I used a cushion to alleviate the (literal) pain in the bum. Food both ways was OK at best nothing special. The highly promoted snack bar was a poor joke. A few packs of chips cans of Pepsi and a bottle or two of water. It actually took me a few trips around the galley area to work out where it was. Service from crew was efficient-ish without being overly friendly or even mildly attentive. They seemed to be around when needed - meal times landing seat belts on time etc but disappeared outside those times. Getting a coffee on the return leg was one challenge too far... All in all I would fly V again if the price was right. Pros - new planes entertainment system seat width. Cons - food attention to detail by staff and seat base comfort.

### Virgin Australia customer review
Recently flew V Australia to Dublin (with Etihad from Abu Dhabi) in Premium Economy. I was surprised at the price very inexpensive compared to other premium options. Flew SYD to AUH in 777-300 nice cabin with access to two toilets pretty amazing for only 40 pax. The staff were exceptional possibly some of the best inflight staff I have experienced for some time. Could not do enough for you and were attentive for the whole 14 hours (was the same for return leg). The seat was particularly comfortable and was able to manage 8 hours sleep. The food was ok not as good as Qantas premium and the inflight entertainment was great good choice and a plus with the noise cancelling headphones. Overall would rate this product very highly and have no hesitation in flying with them again.

Melbourne-New York-Melbourne. I flew Premium Economy and was happy with the seat width pitch and comfort. Good amount of recline so I managed some sleep. LA to NY leg was with Virgin America - in Economy. Seated in exit rows as part of Premium Economy fare. Flight NY to LA on return leg was with Delta - poor service cramped seats. VA crew attentive although tend to disappear after meals are served. However when requested service was treated courteously and respectfully.

### Virgin Australia customer review
Dublin-Sydney (Abu Dhabi-Sydney) with V Australia. Had booked through Etihad so it was a codeshare arrangement. The difference between the first leg (Etihad) and second (V) was huge with V Australia winning all the way. Staff were more professional large Economy seat in the Boeing 777. A somewhat enjoyable 14 hour flight compared to the cramped 7 hour flight from Dublin. The only real drawbacks - I ordered a vegetarian meal and the dinner and breakfast were exactly the same bags/duty free parcels were incredibly slow to reach the baggage carousel.

### Virgin Australia customer review
LAX-MEL-LAX. I arrived at check-in 3 hrs early at MEL the seat I was supposed to have not only changed but ended up in the middle section. After a lot of time at the service desk I was accommodated to a window seat. Ground staff make everything happen in a hurry to move passengers as quickly as possible through the lines. At the beginning of the trip the pilots announced that Melbourne’s runways didn't open until 6am causing the airline to delay boarding at LAX and then also have us sit on the plane for 45 mins prior to takeoff. As previously stated here by another customer extensive announcements during the ride were constantly being made. The seats are decent and the food edible. Neither of those were anything above budget airline standards.

SYD-LAX - flight was delayed over 2 hours waiting for 4 passengers to arrive from Melbourne. Many passengers missed their connecting flights in the US. There was a lack of communication waiting around without updates. Cabin crew were grumpy and didn't respond to call button. Food average. Arriving in LAX we waited 30 mins for bags with one missing. Flight from LAX-SYD was delayed 2 hours flight attendants were much nicer although food still average. Only positive was the in-flight entertainment.

SYD-LAX Premium Economy and Business class coming back. Seats were fine in Premium Economy food quite good. Service ok but when I pressed my attendant button no one came. Not good. Return flight in Business. Not the best Business class I have flown. When fully reclined people have to step over your seat which meant my feet got kicked a few times. Annoying. Service rubbish. Not offered drinks - actually had to ask for wine with my meal! Maybe I was just unlucky with the staff serving me.

SYD-LAX-SYD Economy. On time good quality (and tasty) meals great service from flight attendants who were very friendly and helpful. Nice modern plane (B777-300ER) which felt very roomy seats were comfy with plenty of legroom RED entertainment system was excellent with lots of movies music and TV shows. Coloured LED mood lighting made it a very pleasant experience too.

### Virgin Australia customer review
MEL to LAX Premium Economy. Priority check in and boarding are great. Cabin crew very friendly and attentive to needs but could spend more time visible and in/around the cabin. Seats were hard and very uncomfortable. They must fix this asap. But in PE there is lots of leg room and space to stand and stretch. I didn't get my preferred seat which was disappointing (defeats the purpose of selecting a seat at booking time). Food was average – I couldn't see any difference in an Economy meal to what was served to us so I'm doubting the value for money if you cannot get a decent quality feed in this cabin. Bar service was a bit confusing about whether spirits were self serve and it's difficult to get to the bar if you're not sitting in an aisle seat. IFE touch screen did not work on outbound so I had to use the remote control very difficult to navigate. No WIFI.

Travelled SYD-LAX return. Best Business Class I have traveled in. Lots of space in Buss Cabin Flat beds with mattress overlay doona and pyjamas extremely comfortable. Excellent attentive but relaxed service and best airline food yet tasted. Staff young and attentive. Bar works well even with silly congregating restrictions. Initially dreaded entry of two families with 4 kids under 12 on return journey. Children well supervised by parents and staff provided appropriate support and assistance throughout flight. V Australia now my preferred airline to USA.

### Virgin Australia customer review
Flew BNE-LAX in Premium Economy and returned LAX-BNE. Outbound staff were friendly and food was very good. The only downside was that half the toilets on the plane were broken so we were asked to go before we left. Return crew were far less helpful we didn't see anyone for most of the flight and maybe it was the difference between Premium vs standard Economy we slept most of the leg anyway. Seats are comfortable with a good amount of width and leg room tray tables are too small and flimsy. Food in both classes was good RED- Entertainment system is excellent with plenty to keep you occupied. A lack of online check-in is frustrating especially when you cannot guarantee a seat when booking.

Sydney-Paris with Sydney-Abu Dhabi in Premium Economy and Etihad from Abu Dhabi-Paris. London-Sydney with Abu Dhabi-Sydney in PE. V Australia seats are new and feel roomier than Virgin Atlantic's Premium Economy. It is 38 inch pitch and even when the person in front fully reclines there is still enough leg room. The PE cabin has dedicated staff and cabin and 2 bathrooms for 40 passengers no queue! Compared to 7 toilets for 288 passengers in Economy. The food was good but it is an Economy main course with different entree and dessert. However you are served first so there is no chance of running out of your preferred choice and your meal tray is collected as soon as you finish your meal whereas in Economy you have to wait. I really loved the staff both flights they were enthusiastic lovely and friendly and they came through the cabin through the flight I lost count how many times they came through with water or other drinks snacks more snacks. Very attentive staff! Could not fault them. If you were not too lazy to get out of your seat there was also the self service bar which was full stocked and was restocked throughout the 14hr flight with roast beef/chicken sandwiches soft drinks alcohol potato chips nuts etc. The entertainment was good because you can start watching TV shows or movies as soon as you sit down you don't need to wait until the plane is at cruising altitude. I would fly them again!

### Virgin Australia customer review
SYD-LAX-SYD. Best airline to LA. Much better than Qantas. Leg room was reasonable seat width was very good but the seat bottom was hard which caused a lot of 'pins n needles'. Cabin crew did a fantastic job with constant smiles and they did not stop working hard the whole flight. I travel often to LAX but as I cant select my seat paying a sale fare I will not travel with them again. This is very important to me. Food could also be better with 2 small meals on a 15 hour flight and the snack bar that's advertised only has 1 type of snack (when they bothered to fill it).

### Virgin Australia customer review
Sydney-Brisbane-Phiket then Phuket-Melbourne-Sydney. On each flight I found the ground staff excellent and extremely helpful. Cabin crew were the best I have encountered with any airline. In Brisbane I was given customs priority pass yet did not expect this. Granted pass to the lounge and found it adequate. I have flown with many airlines throughout the world as well as Australia. V Australia will always be my preferred airline if they fly to the destination I am travelling to.

### Virgin Australia customer review
I know Economy is the bottom of the rung so I accept the cramped seating and so so food. It is what I paid for. In saying that the seating and food is better than Qantas. IFE is fantastic. The problem I have is the customer service. Very rude cabin staff and ground crew. My seat would not recline and when I asked for assistance I was told "there is nothing I can do about it at 30 thousand feet. A simple sorry would have been fine. Anytime I asked an attendant something I was spoken to like I was a naughty child annoying his parent. Not being able to choose your seat because you paid the sale fare is totally stupid. If you choose to fly Economy of course you will pay the cheapest fare. Why would you pay hundreds of dollars more for the same class. This totally undid any of the good things about the airline. On customer service and not being able to select your seat I would not recommend this airline.

### Virgin Australia customer review
I flew from LAX-BNE and well as SYD-LAX without any issues. The flight itself was very pleasant and the on board entertainment was great. However customer service is horrendous. Aside from not being able to reserve a seat if you buy a promotional fare V Australia offers no help if calling about flight changes or concerns. I was going to fly from LAX-MLB but 3 weeks before the flight a V Australia representative called my home and told me they had to make flight changes which did not suit my schedule. Customer service does not offer any leeway even if it is not your fault. They are in fact unhelpful and rude and will not connect you to a supervisor if there are problems with your flight. I would only recommend V Australia if you know for certain that no changes will occur in your schedule or that the time of your arrival is not important and can be changed last minute.

### Virgin Australia customer review
Flew SYD-LAX LAX-SYD in Premium Economy. Outbound staff were great and food was surprisingly edible. Return crew were far less helpful (didn’t see anyone for most of the flight) and food was pretty appalling. Seats are comfortable with plenty of width and leg room tray tables are too small and flimsy. On board amenities are good but only 2 toilets in the cabin meant a lot of queuing in the last hour of the flight. Entertainment system is excellent - plenty of movies TV documentary and music to choose from however I could not get any connectivity through USB. Headphones are of poor quality but acceptable. Lack of online check-in is frustrating especially when you cannot guarantee your seat when booking. Overall a very good experience for the price paid would consider again.

### Virgin Australia customer review
Flew business from SYD-LAX-LAX-SYD. Bed is fully flat there are power outlets and USB ports. Staff are friendly and food is great (for airline food). There is a full doona with the lie flat beds and entertainment system with hours of movies. Only slight negative is that their head rests do not go up a great deal so when the seat is in a full upright position my head clears the headrest however in fairness I am 6'3 and the flat bed is more than enough for me to sleep on without my feel hanging off the end.

### Virgin Australia customer review
Probably the best airline across the Pacific but not having online check in and not being able to choose your seats if you paid a sale price for the ticket sadly undo most of the good things about the airline. Inflight entertainment is one of the best however food is of the usual economy style and portions. Bring food with you as it is such a long flight!

### Virgin Australia customer review
Brisbane to LA return in Premium Economy. The food was great and service excellent. Leg room great and seat very comfortable. Great selection of movie entertainment.

### Virgin Australia customer review
AUH-SYD only one flight as part of a codeshare with Etihad (which I would not recommend). B777 cabin seemed roomy with good seats and excellent inflight entertainment. Reasonable food and friendly service. It was only perhaps 30% full in economy so maybe this put all the staff in a happier mood. Main gripe is that headphones are cheap and nasty lots of background noise.

### Virgin Australia customer review
MEL-LAX LAX-SYD. Flight over almost 100% full but staff professional and energetic. There are little touches uses (doing water runs with the water' lit up' by a torch so the darkened cabin can see what is on offer). Flight back only about 75% full so most people had a spare seat next to them. Legroom excellent. Check in LA opens 10 hours before departure which is terrific when you are coming in early from a domestic flight. IFE outstanding. My complaint would be that there are far too many announcements both over PA and interrupting the IFE.

### Virgin Australia customer review
Sydney-Abu Dhabi was upgraded to Business Class on flight over and on return flight there was only 4 of us in Premium Economy. Excellent from food to seating service entertainment. Same could not be said for our connections with Etihad to Milan - will never fly Etihad ever again!

### Virgin Australia customer review
Prior to purchasing my ticket I spoke to a V Australia representative who told me that my fare would allow seat selection prior to the flight. However when I called back to make my seat selection I was informed that I could not. When I politely and calmly asked to speak to a supervisor I was told the supervisor would not speak to me. This is unacceptable customer service.

### Virgin Australia customer review
BNA-LAX-BNE Economy. Flights and onboard service excellent - cannot say the same for LA staff. 12 hour delay without any direct communication beforehand. Placed at hotel at midnight due back at airport 6.30am. no meal arrangements. Staff must be aware they are dealing with strangers to LA when advising of relocation to hotels etc. Completely spoiled an otherwise top experience.

### Virgin Australia customer review
SYD-LAX-SYD Economy. The food and cabin crew were very good both ways. The seats are comfortable and inflight entertainment is brilliant. LAX-SYD we had a pair of seats in row 52 at the rear where my wife had a window seat and I had an aisle.

### Virgin Australia customer review
Brisbane - LAX - Brisbane - Premium Economy. Enjoyed both flights. B777 very quiet noise cancelling headphones and great selection of movies. Seats reclined enough to get to sleep. Food was ok. Bar service good idea but as the bar is between the 2 toilets it is difficult to access or walk through especially when food service is on. Staff excellent. Loved the coloured strip lighting too.

### Virgin Australia customer review
The cabin crew and ground crew are anti-children. Neither would allow us access to an infant bassinet. The crew manager said that I was being disruptive for asking. During the flight the crew invented rules about standing and sitting zones but only enforced them for the toddlers.

### Virgin Australia customer review
Melbourne-LA found entertainment and leg room fantastic service what you would expect in any service industry. Return we also found consistency with the service and food to be good.

### Virgin Australia customer review
SYD- LAX was ok. Seat was uncomfortable food disappointing (I'm not a fussy eater when it comes to airplane food). LAX to SYD very disappointing! Once again the food was poor. My seat would not recline back. I asked one of the attendants to look into it but she never came back to assist or offer to move me in another seat - on the way to the toilets found a person who had 3 seats all to himself. So the entire 14 hour flight my seat was reclined up while the seat in front of me was reclined forward. Very uncomfortable! In addition my blanket wrapped in plastic was dirty. I think V Australia is focussed too much on giving a 'cool' impression to their customers. But really they should focus on serving the needs of their customers.

### Virgin Australia customer review
Brisbane to Los Angeles return. Fantastic service friendly crew. More legroom than other airlines. Great service in Los Angeles prior to departure. Would fly them again no question.

### Virgin Australia customer review
Abu Dhabi to Sydney on V Australia in Business Class. I was very disappointed with the Business seat configuration for lack of privacy. Food was great however limited free dining options and some wines were claimed to not be served on the sector despite no indication of that in the menu. Waited 20 minutes after getting on board to even be asked if I wanted a drink! Waited and waited for another despite there only being 16 people in the cabin. This was an Etihad Airways codeshare but it should not mean reduction in quality or service!

### Virgin Australia customer review
Business Class LAX-Brisbane-LAX. 2x3x2 seating seat/bed comfortable with excellent IFE. Inflight service and food is excellent and superior to other carriers on this route. The menu is extensive. Wonderful presentation and taste. There is a non stop bar. Staff seem to love their job.

### Virgin Australia customer review
Flying to Christchurch New Zealand following the earthquake. The government has issued no non essential travel warnings there are shortages of water sewage problems and many wounded souls - we asked to re-route to another NZ city. Our hotel is no longer standing. All other hotels anywhere near that area are full and much needed for emergency workers and victims. V Australia is refusing to re-route us - unless we want to pay $3700 to change our two tickets. Unbelievable. It appears that V Australia is encouraging people to go into a disaster zone. The customer service people on the phone have been insensitive.

### Virgin Australia customer review
They changed my flight from LAX to Melbourne and never let me know. I had just arrived in LA after a 6 hour flight went to check in and the people at the counter just laughed and said "that flight doesn't exist". I gave them the Eticket and they said " just this week they changed the schedule your flight doesn't leave until tomorrow". They never sent an email called or even apologised. So now I'm being re-routed through Brisbane and my 27 hour trip has just blown out to 33 hours with an extra stop! If you want to get to where you're going on schedule do not fly this airline.

### Virgin Australia customer review
Frankfurt to Abu Dhabi on Etihad was great but then got surprise of V Australia from Abu Dhabi to Sydney. The crew were fantastic and V Australia have lifted their game. Cannot speak highly enough of this carrier.

### Virgin Australia customer review
LAX-SYD-LAX. Business Class both ways. Best flights I've had. Virgin Blue domestic legs were in Premium Economy and exceeded my expectations. US carriers (Domestic) could learn a thing or two from Blue.

### Virgin Australia customer review
Phuket to Brisbane and was upgraded from Premium Economy to Business. Excellent from the champagne offered after boarding to the superb menu. They have a bar where you can sit and have drinks whilst the staff made up the bed. I am just sorry they are discontinuing this route - all in all this was a terrific flight.

### Virgin Australia customer review
MEL-SYD-LAX easy transfer with Virgin Blue. great new aircraft wonderful staff food and entertainment. Flew Emirates later on VAustralia a clear winner.

### Virgin Australia customer review
Business Class Melbourne-Phuket. We liked the cabin crew and food was quite good. Found the seats comfortable and appreciated the noise cancelling headphones. My family of two children and grandchildren were allowed to share the Business class lounge prior to departure. We were shocked to find on our return that we had been downgraded from Business Class to Premium economy. The seating was awful. We do not know how we could travel with this airline again since there is no guarantee that the same will not happen in the future.

### Virgin Australia customer review
My family and I flew to Phuket from Melbourne. My wife and I had lounge passes due to flying business class and they were nice enough to provide a lounge pass to my father who was on the same flight flying economy. Once we boarded we were impressed with the layout and provided a glass of Moet. We were also travelling with an 18 month old and they provided a seat for her after take off. The food was amazing as well as the service.

### Virgin Australia customer review
BNE to Phuket Business class. My partner and I have flown this route with V 3 times in 12 months and been in Business Class Row 5 (very private single Business VIP row with own partition for privacy) and Premium Economy. We both hold Silver so we are supporters of the Virgin group but not fanatics. IF the new CEO wants to drag V group into a full service carrier then the Business Class service training must be improved. The cabin is fine seats pretty good but bit narrow food actually reasonable too (unlike other reviewers I thought it compared OK). But the cabin crew are treating the Business cabin as an extension of Economy. We had to press the call button 3 times on one occasion. Very little close attention to passenger wishes or pre-empting them we felt the crew were controlling the cabin to suit their work flow rather than serve us. The work related noise the crew make the whole night is appalling. I suggest they train up Business crew only. Yes you can get cheaper Business seats on V Australia but then don’t call it Business Class or raise the standard and price.

### Virgin Australia customer review
Sydney - Phuket return in Business. The business class is competitively priced and you get what you pay for. Cabin crew a bit hit and miss ranging from very over familiar to the lacking any interest at all. Seats were flat bed but skinny and the entertainment was fair but limited. Food was the real disappointment when compared to other business class. I think you can compare as equal to business class Korean Air China Air etc but it in no way compares to the catering on airlines such as Qantas or Singapore. If a special fare on V Australia came my way I would travel again but all in all I think it would be hard decision to travel V Australia business if I could even get a premium economy seat on a premium airline with a better timetable.

### Virgin Australia customer review
SYD-LAX and LAX-MEL. Outbound service just OK. Entertainment system froze and it took almost two hours to get it working again. Attendants were apologetic and tried their best to fix the situation but seemed very harried and stressed. Three hours of non-stop turbulance made it very hard to sleep. Food was poor. I loved the entertainment system (Once it started working). B777 great cabin design and nice mood lighting. Inbound flight was much better. Left on time friendly staff landed early. Very pleased with this flight. Food was still not great though.

### Virgin Australia customer review
MEL-HKT Economy class. Packed flight. Plane layout design colour sceme etc is modern fun and unusual. Staff young enthusiastic but slow with everything. IFE excellent - new release movies and entire series of TV shows. First meal service slow but great food - modern Australian with Italian influences. V Australian doesn't really seem to know where it fits or what it wants to be (they are cancelling all HKT and JHN services next month) but they represent value for money and a fresh approach to long-haul flights.

### Virgin Australia customer review
Phuket to Melbourne seat 5K Business. Crew (almost all female) were trying hard and much improved on earlier flights but a bit folksy over familiar and lacking sophistication. I do not appreciate being addressed as "love" "darling" and similar monikers. PA announcements mostly unnecessary and disturbing. We do not need to be informed that the crew are "fabulous. (They're not.) Beverage service and selection good. Serving soft nuts and dried fruit with drinks was not a good start. Food service average to poor. In fact every aspect of the food selection and presentation needs a review. It was very disappointing. IFE excellent and the noise cancelling head phones are my new favourite toy. They're amazing. The seat narrow and a bit hard for sleeping. The 2x3x2 configuration not popular. Overall disappointing but fair value. Finally can we be left alone to sleep as long as possible? Why wake us (prior arrangement for no breakfast) until absolutely necessary?

### Virgin Australia customer review
Economy Class LAX-SYD-CHC returning CHC->MEL-SYD-LAX. Our original flight was changed three times prior to departure date due to changes in their schedule .Chaos at LAX departure gate. Noisy crowded unable to hear announcements. Were not told that we needed an Australian visa to pass though their airports! Found this out at the check-in counter and were sent to a computer to apply and pay a fee then back in line to check-in. Very inconvenient. Would have been nice to know in advance that we needed to check-in and get boarding passes and go through security at each airport. Our connections were only about an hour and it was very stressful running to catch each flight. Pacific Blue and Virgin Blue flights were less than comfortable. V Australia was OK but food was pretty sad and they left our trays on for over 45 mins. Only the great entertainment system saved the 13 hour flights from being unbearable.

### Virgin Australia customer review
Economy class MEL-LAX and LAX-BNE. Outbound flight was OK without being brilliant. Seats get a bit hard after a couple of hours. Seat pitch good compared to Virgin Atlantic. Meals were reasonable for Economy. IFE very good probably the best part of the flight. We were not impressed with the departure lounge at LAX very cramped. All things considered V Australia represents reasonable value for money without being a wonderful flying experience.

### Virgin Australia customer review
Great price business class LAX to Brisbane. No online option during booking to select seat. Discovered I was required to call to reserve a seat. Got last and worst seat left. Rude staff at LAX for check in able to share lounge. Seats narrow and hard for a bed. United airlines seats much more comfortable for sitting and sleeping. Superior selection of electronic entertainment mitigated other factors. Returned with window seat 2 across much better than the 3 across between a snorer and insomniac.

### Virgin Australia customer review
I flew Christmas 2010 Economy MEL-LAX. Given that the flight was on Christmas day they were generous enough to offer us a small present. The only negative aspects on this flight were the food and the seat. The food was horrible. The seat cushioning was too hard. After 2 hours it became incredibly uncomfortable and unbearable to sit down. Walking around the cabin and applying cushions temporarily eased the pain but it was too hard for a 14 hour flight.

### Virgin Australia customer review
Business Class SYD LAX via BNE. Amazing service and great aircraft. Connecting through BNE is a pain especially with the direct service from SYD but not a hassle and the earlier arrival time at LAX worked better for me. Great value for money I would fly them over Qantas United or Delta on the same route.

### Virgin Australia customer review
Economy class SYD LAX return. Staff friendly and generally attentive. Food fine with at least three choices for dinner. Water bottle given out at beginning of flight. On flight to LA was offered a snack at some point between dinner and breakfast (but not on return flight). If you want water later you need to get it yourself at 'snack bar' - no bottles thought pour water into a cup. A bit slow in picking up trays after meals. In flight selection great. Good selection of movies.
