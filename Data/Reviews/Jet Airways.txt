### "cabin crew was mechanical"
Return flight from Delhi to Singapore in February 2019, ground services could be better. A desperate attempt was made to make people a JPMiles member just after the check-in. The plane was an old Boeing 737-800 with an unfunctional IFE screen, you must connect to the wifi hotspot to access the entertainment section. Although it seemed easy but it requires an app to access on phones. The cabin crew was mechanical at their work, food quality could be improved.

### "Worst airline ever"
Mumbai to Amsterdam. Worst airline ever. I flight to Delhi on April 6th, plane was dirty, old, food basic. No entertaiment on board. What is more on the way back the flight was cancelled and I needed to wait in Mumbai for two days. Now it is not possible to get any refund from the airline as the ticket was bought via company in Europe. If they ever start to operate again do not buy tickets from that airline.

### "a third class airline"
Not Verified | Jet Airways is a third class airline. I booked the ticket from Ahmedabad to Mumbai but after 2 days I got the message that they cancelled the flight for operation reasons. So I called customer care executive with holding line 1.45 hrs and make arrangement in another flight. Unluckily that flight was also canclled with same reason and arranged for another flight. Same thing happened 4 to 5 times. Finally last flight also canclled with same reason.

### "Staff absolutely useless"
Not Verified |  London to Mumbai in December 2018. Staff absolutely useless. My child meals were pre-booked by the travel agent and the staff did not supply any food for my child saying the travel agent messed it up!! Seriously? My travel documents had information of meals booked and staff decided their own things. Absolute idiots. the service is bogus, planes are dirty, toilets are disgusting. Seats are not cleaned before boarding the planes. Never using Jet Airways again.

### "Very disappointing"
My initial departure flight to Pune was canceled a week before departure date. At first we kinda accepted it and get along with the rerouted flight to Mumbai. Because of this I need to stay at hotel in Mumbai before continuing my trip to Pune by car in the morning. Yet it doesnt simply end with re route trouble, my checked in bagage is delayed! It still left in Singapore where I transited. They promised to take my bag tomorrow in the morning yet my bag arrived 2 days later. As it not enough with just that, they also canceled my return ticket a day before. I supposed to fly on saturday morning ( I write this review on friday), and due to sudden information from Jet Airways my office had to find flight replacement, best closest day they get is sunday evening whom will be operated by another airways, and I will arrive in jakarta at Monday-noon. Canceling all appointment plan in the weekend. Very disappointing.

### "aircraft was deplorable"
Toronto to Delhi via Amsterdam. The condition of aircraft was deplorable, 20+ hrs journey no entertainment system was provided, and the staff neither good either. They were having fun mingling amongst themselves, instead of serving and taking care of customers. Wont ever fly again, and not like they seem to be in business anytime soon.

### "staff were very rude"
Vadodara to Bangalore. Cancellation of the flight without any prior intimation to the flyers. I had a flight scheduled for 5:15 am which got cancelled without me being informed. I got to know this after reaching the airport while looking for my flight number. The Jet Airways staff were very rude as if it was my fault for booking a flight with them. They blamed it completely on Make My Trip and told me I can ask for a full refund as if by giving a full refund Jet was favouring me. Jet Airways will stay grounded.

### "experience was quiet stressful"
London to Mumbai. Jet Airways Heathrow ground staff was abusive on a phone call with her colleague while she made us wait on the side. We had a situation And had to ask the agent if she can find out with the manager if there’s any way out. I found it very rude and unprofessional. It doesn’t end there. She wasn’t finished serving us and before that she gets a phone call on the desk phone. She could’ve simply finished with us and dealt with the phone call In private later and we could’ve avoided witnessing most unpleasant language before boarding. When I mentioned to the agent about the experience she shared a feedback email and said - I don’t care. Please write to this email address. The whole experience was quiet stressful and could’ve avoided with basic manners.

### "A disgrace to the industry"
Received an email from Jet Airways 7 days before my return flight, they cancelled the Goa to Mumbai leg and offered no alternative, spent 3 days trying to contact customer services, unsuccessful. Had to purchase this leg with an alternative carrier. Made the Mumbai to London connection, plane dirty, flight crew did the very basic expected, food terrible, in-flight entertainment well below standard, the worst international flight I have taken in 60 years. I will never fly with this airline again, if I could give no stars for this airline then I would. A disgrace to the industry.

### "Food was pathetic"
London to Bangalore via Mumbai. The worst international flight I have ever boarded in my life. I flew with Jet Airways before also and was ok but this was horrible. LCD screen entertainment system is not working through out the flight. Food was pathetic and there was shortage of food and cabin crew where behaving very cheap manner. I will never fly with Jet again.

### "I am absolutely disgusted"
Not Verified |  Bangkok to London via Mumbai. My son booked with this airline to return to the UK from Thailand on 23.04.19. He is still in Thailand with an email cancelling his flight home. A young man left stranded. No explanation. I am absolutely disgusted. I have had to purchase another flight to help him get home. They provide an online form to claim back a full repayment the bloody form doesn't work. You complete it and submit and nothing! How can this airline get away with ruining peoples holidays. Leaving people stranded on the other side of the world

### "Terrible business ethics"
Not Verified |  Delhi to Goa via Mumbai. Terrible business ethics. I booked my flight over one month ahead, then they emailed me three days before traveling saying flight was canceled. I had to purchase new tickets at over twice the price from a different airline. No offer of refund in the email -I had to call twice (over one hour on hold) to obtain credit. This same incident happened again a week later with another flight canceled. I would never fly again with Jet Airways.

### "no leg room at all"
Delhi to Cochin. Even though the airline is facing a financial problems and the pilots consider going on strike I thought I would not be that bad. First of all, no leg room at all, no free snack nor beverages. On the other hand, the main goal has been reached - successfully we made it to the final destinations safe and sound. The ratio price/comfort is similar to small and budget airlines in Europe e.g. Ryanair, EasyJet, Czech Airlines.

### "never use it again"
I booked my ticket and received an email saying that the flight cancelled and need change the flight for onward journey. Then I had to change my coach by paying £12 extra. After my onward journey they send another email that my return flight cancelled from Cochin to London and they have no option for me. They said they will pay half of the price and cancelled my ticket. I paid £293 for my return journey with other airline and paid another £15 for change coach. Total I paid £320 extra and today jet Airways send me an email saying they will pay me only £140 . I lost £180 for their faults. I am an Etihad silver card member always use jet Airways but never use it again. They show cheap price and later make you pay more.

### "what about the customer?"
I booked my flight from Coimbatore to Mumbai on 14th of April 2019. Jet Airways rescheduled the flight by 20 hours. Again rescheduled for 22 00 hours. Couple of days back I got a notification that my flight is been canceled. It's really unfair part from Jet Airways. For your internal issue you cancelled flight. But what about the customer? Very unfair and not at all satisfied with the service provided by Jet Airways.

### "a joke of an airline"
Mumbai to Bangkok. Jet Airways is a joke of an airline. We booked 3 economy tickets using mile awards 8 months in advance. One-way from Mumbai to Bangkok. The airline cancelled our flights twice; 12:30 PM to 08:30 AM, and again to 01:55 AM. The last time there was no automatic re-booking and we had to call from our cruise ship to make the new reservation (costly). This caused us to cut our vacation short by one day. The airport check-in staff were totally disinterested in their job. When we arrived at the counter to check-in, the agent just got up and walked away without any explanation. We had to wait for another counter to open. The flight attendants were not much better - constantly bumping into our aisle seat and waking us up while trying to get some sleep on a 4 hour red eye. The only positive thing about the flight was our baggage in Bangkok arrived very quickly.

### "This was outrageous"
The service was terrible. At the gate, they didn't have any speakers to announce boarding zones, only a couple of guys yelling at the top of their voices. This naturally led to a lot of confusion and arguments between the people lined up. Seats were uncomfortable. I do not know how these seats are different from other airplanes but me and the people around me agreed that our bottoms and backs were hurting. The seats are just bad. In-flight service was even worse. We received a meal (lunch) about 1 hour into the flight. After that, for the next 6 hours, they didn't even offer water! We were parched. We tried grabbing their attention with 'attendant calls'. Nobody responded. I even walked over to the galley to request water. They said there will be a beverage service soon, which never came. This was outrageous. For 6 hours on a 10 hour flight with no beverages, snacks or even water! We received another small meal an hour before landing where we requested multiple bottles of water. But most food and water items were over since, surprise, the crew had mistakenly started serving from the back of the airplane to the front!

### "no alternatives provided"
Mumbai to Nagpur with Jet Airways. Cancelled flight without explanation and no alternatives provided. Had to phone the call centre for a refund, which took 45 minutes and was told that it would take 7-10 working days to process! No apology. Would never use again!

### "a very good experience"
Mumbai to Bengaluru. Flew Jet Airways for a business trip. Turned out to be a great experience. Staff at BOM airport was very polite and helpful. They had deployed a few people for crowd management. Check in was quick, so was boarding. In flight experience was good - since I had a corporate booking, a meal was added to the ticket. Coffee and Veg wrap were both good. All in all, a very good experience.

### "cancelled without any notice"
Pune to Abu Dhabi flight scheduled for 19th March cancelled without any notice. Received a curt email saying flight is cancelled. Did not give any alternative option. Had to call up Call Center and after a hold time of 30 mins was told that options available were only with 10 hour layovers. Wouldn't recommend Jet Airways to anyone again!

### "my luggage were damaged"
London to Baghdogra via Mumbai. Worst airline! Would pay a little more to get a different airline next time. Rude staff! Both my luggage were damaged by the baggage handlers. On my arrival to India I found one of my suitcases was broken even though fragile stickers were stuck. On my return, brand new suitcase wheels were missing so I had to throw that suitcase aswell.

### "cancelled without any notice"
Goa to Mumbai. Flight was cancelled without any notice. Jet Airways flight status page was even still showing an "ontime" then "arrived status. Heard of 3 other flights cancelled in same conditions that day. No refunds offered on spot, had to refer to our travel agents.

### "Horrible customer service"
On two separate instances Jet airways cancelled my flight within 24 hours from departure. After cancelling the first time they just sent me an email 6 hours before the flight and it was a hell to get a hold of them to rebook another flight. Second time was even worse they just rebooked me to another day without consulting if it worked for me or not. I ended up on customer service and hold lines for 8 hours since I would have missed my next international flight because of them. Worst part is they did have alternative flights available in economy class but after cancelling many customers they had hiked the prices of alternative flights and kept refusing to book those due to price difference. I ended up booking with another airline at twice the price since her airways only agreed to refund me at a price I had paid 1 month in advance, to book the same day hiked price instead. Horrible customer service and operations.

### "Worst airline ever!"
London to Kochi via Mumbai. Worst airline ever! Never choose this airline even if you had to pay a few more extra for a decent one. The connection flight to Kochi was found cancelled on reaching Mumbai and was offered the next day's flight due in 24 hours. Reduced to provide accommodation/lounge access. They kept sending messages every week that flight number and times from London changed until the day of travel but I never expected this treatment.

### "the flight was changed"
Singapore to Delhi. I did not actually fly with the airline. I did purchase a ticket before the flight was changed without any option to cancel or modify further. The return flight was also pushed back a day and there was no accommodation arranged for the additional night I would need to stay. Cancelling or modifying through the website would incur a hefty fee. I reached out to them via email and the first response came after two weeks and there was no response since. The only option was to reach out to their call center. It took about 15 minutes ($30 of international call) to get through the lines and finally get the ticket cancelled and refunded. Even then, the agent was unwilling to give a full refund until I made it clear I had no choice and they changed the flight without my permission. I would suggest never flying with them.

### "Impressive service"
Delhi to Jaipur with Jet Airways. Impressive service for such a short flight (less than one hour). Staff were friendly and polite, and in the short period they had they still managed to service a light meal, complete with table clothes, silverware and porcelain crockery. Food was decent and accompanied by juice. Seats were spacious and clean. A good flight.

### "staff dishonest and rude"
Not Verified |  We went three hours early with our tickets on our smart phones to check in in New Delhi. We were a family of five traveling together. When we arrived a rude lady told us three of our tickets had been canceled. She said Delta canceled them (we had booked through Delta and they confirmed they did not cancel our tickets.) We called Delta, who Jet Air said they were not partners with, and were told Jet Air had canceled two of our tickets and Delta put my daughter and granddaughter on another flight. We were then told my other daughter’s seat was not canceled and given our confirmation numbers. When we got to the Jet Air window, an even ruder lady said that all of our tickets were canceled-even the two they told us were there before! So, we called Delta back And they said Jet Air must have made mistakes as no seats were canceled by Delta. It took Delta hours with us on the phone to find us flights out on other airlines. It was the worst experience ever! I have notified Delta and they compensated us-my husband flies twice a week them. We had a problem with them on the trip down-we spent two hours running around because they said my younger daughter’s seat was canceled! I believe this airlines staff to be dishonest and rude. Warn everyone not to fly with Then unless you want to be stuck at the airport!

### "staff borderline rude"
Dubai to Hong Kong via Mumbai. Cheap flight tickets but you understand why: old aircraft, no entertainment on flight (screens don't work), dodgy seats. All this to arrive in Mumbai to discover our flight was delayed 2h with no warning or compensation (like a lounge access for example). Airport staff borderline rude and sleeping at the desk, really showing their annoyance when you approach them. Flights delayed both on our way to and from Hong Kong. Cheap yes but at your own risk !

### "Zero empathy for customers"
Abu Dhabi to Chandigarh via Delhi. Jet Airways cancelled the 9W 211 flight from Abu Dhabi to Delhi on March 1st 2019, didn't inform me till I got to the airport. I was stranded in Abu Dhabi. They told me that they can't rebook me or put me in a hotel. So I have to pay triple amount for a new ticket on a different airline and the hotel stay, i.e almost an additional $1000. Zero empathy for customers. The Jet Airways staff in Abu Dhabi reflected the culture prevalent in the airline, i.e useless, smiling and enjoying while the customers suffered.

### "never recommend Jet Airways"
Chennai to Doha via Mumbai, our flight was delayed by 20 minutes from airport and we missed our connecting flight and we were taken to Jet Airways counter by the staff and waited more then 3 hours for them to decide and finally they offered us another flight after 24 hours which was not acceptable at all. The staff were rude. I explained that we are traveling from last 24 hours and we are tired and we needs some place to rest but directly they refuse saying do whatever you like, we cant provide place to rest, and also said that if you make noise they will call police and through me out of airport. So this is what we paid for. I will never recommend Jet Airways.

### "Most unprofessional airline"
Mumbai to Delhi. Most unprofessional airline. My flight was twice delayed without even an email from the Jet team. Second time when I was flying I got a flight cancellation message at 4am in the morning less than 24 hours before the flight. Later, I got another message saying my flight has been changed to another flight which would reach the destination 2hrs later. Also, all this without a single mail of apology or remorse or compensation for delay. Finally, all this has been a crazy change to my overall schedule. When I called the customer care I couldn't connect to an agent even after 25 mins of waiting. Worst customer service ever!

### "I didn't get the refund"
Not Verified |  I booked the flight from Delhi to Leh and back, when I was supposed to be coming back on 8th Feb, 2019, my flight got cancelled by Jet Airways, I have began the process for refund which they claimed will be refunded within 8 to 10 days. Even after 11 days, I didn't get the refund, so I called again and they process it once again and ask me to wait for 8 to 10 days. I did and still there is no refund, now that I call there customer care, they are not even picking up the phone. I have more things to do than writing this review and calling jet airways again and again, so be mindful..

### "Worst customer service"
Not Verified |  Worst customer service. We booked a direct from Hanoi to New Delhi well in advance but then we received a notification that our flight was cancelled and we would fly through Bangkok with 9hour stopover. We tried calling customer service, which is impossible to reach, i’ve been in hold for over 2 hours and have tried to call them several times, every time waiting endlessly. Then we receive a new notification that our flight stopover flight was cancelled and we would make a second stopovers is Mumbai (total flight incl stopover now 22 hours) And somehow we are still not able to reach customer service!

### "a horrible experience"
Chennai to Amsterdam via Mumbai. I took Jet airways twice. When I went to India, they did everything possible for me to miss my flight. I was there, standing to check-in for my next flight (after almost 2 hours in immigration) but when arriving to the counter, the staff told me it was closed already. We had to make a scandal in order for them to provide another flight. It took 12 more hours to get to my destination. No food or a resting place was offered. No help either. On the way back, from Chennai to Mumbai, I was told that I'm not entitled for any meal at all since I didn't book it online, although I did. Again, no replacement was suggested, besides purchasing my own meal. What a horrible experience. Never again!

### "never recommend Jet Airways"
Dubai to Mumbai, our flight was delayed by 1 hour from airport and we missed our connecting flight and we were taken to Jet Airways counter by the staff and waited more then 2 hours for them to decide and finally they offered us another flight after 9 hours via Muscat which was not acceptable at all, and the staff were rude. I explained that we are traveling from last 9 hours and we are tired and we needs some place to rest but directly they refuse saying do whatever you like we cant provide place to rest and also said that if you make noise they will call police and through me out of airport, so this is what we paid for. I will never recommend Jet Airways.

### "airline should be penalized"
Dubai to New Delhi. I had booked the flight well in advance in order to get decent fare, however the airline just before 2 weeks of departure rescheduled the timing. First of all I dont understand how can the flight be cancelled 2 weeks before. Further after checking new rates for Dubai to New Delhi, I found that the fares got increased. So, my doubt that my flight was rescheduled as I had paid low fare and the airline was being greedy and changed the flight for me. Cheap tricks followed by airlines in order to benefit but still they are suffering and reporting losses. I appreciate that I will be getting full refund but the airline should be penalized and they should reimburse the passengers more than the fare paid for  harassment as well as again struggling to find booking as per required time

### "A disappointing journey"
Not Verified |  A disappointing journey! My son and I are now en route from Chennai to Prague on 17 Feb. We are at the time of writing this review still stuck in Paris for 9 hours waiting for a flight to Prague. This is a Jet Airways shared with Air France. The reason given was a one hour delay in Chennai which made us miss our connecting flight. Consequently we have had to wait for 9 hours for the next connecting flight. Without as much as a courtesy of a free lunch or a drink. This isn’t so much about the cost of a lunch as much as it is about caring for your passengers. Horrible wait and the last time on this airline.

### "not recommend this airline"
Hong Kong to Kathmandu via Delhi. Originally our flight from Delhi to Kathmandu on Feb 7th was 17:05 and it was rescheduled to 21:00. Then on the way back from Kathmandu to Delhi on Feb 17th, originally 20:20, it was rescheduled to 12:15. We had to stay at Delhi airport for 12 hours before taking 02:10 flight back to Hong Kong! I emailed them 4 days ago so far I got no responses. I talked to their staff at the desk before security check at Delhi airport he told me to find manager at Gate 15. There's no one at Gate 15. I waited until someone from Jet Airways showed up. He said he could do nothing about it and I should complain about the Hong Kong office or whoever I bought tickets from. BUT for all I know it was Jet Airways who rescheduled the flights. Not the website I bought tickets from. Our holiday was cut short and their customer service is zero! I would not recommend this airline to anyone!

### "Surprisingly pleasant"
CDG-BOM and MAA-CDG with connections to VIE with Austrian. Surprisingly pleasant long-haul flights. Jet's B777, as with most of other operators who have them in 3-4-3 configuration, has cramped seating with insufficient legroom and width. IFE with sufficient content but screen could be better. A333, on the other hand, is fitted with very spacious seats, both in terms of width and legspace and perfectly responding IFE screens. All meals on both legs were tasty, breakfast could be bigger though. Cabin crew warm and well-mannered on both legs, present in cabin for the whole flight duration and providing extra snacks and drinks upon request. Flights departed and arrived on time. On the return leg, checked bag got stuck in CDG and was delivered one day later to my home. However, this is mostly fault of the airport for not being able to transfer it between aircrafts, Jet can be hardly blamed (and Air France as the ticketing carrier handled the issue in quick and efficient manner). Jet ground staff in MAA asking ridiculous "security" questions (e.g. why is a Czech citizen flying to Austria and not Czech Republic, as if it was their business anyhow) and prolonging the whole check-in process unnecessarily. Jet pleasantly surprised me on both flown legs (CDG-BOM and MAA-CDG) and hopefully, they will survive their current financial situation as they have a good thing going on (at least on long-haul). Choose A333 over B777 if possible as it is in all aspects superior.

### "A very bad experience"
Flew Delhi to Lucknow with Jet Airways. A very bad experience to interact with their customer support experience. Will try to never go with this airline again, although they provide low fares, dealing with them is too costly. Try to avoid booking, if you value your time.

### "Absolutely disappointed"
Not Verified |  Mangalore to Kathmandu via Mumbai. Absolutely disappointed with Jet Aiways support, or rather, the lack of support! My flight was cancelled and tickets rescheduled. Am traveling with my parents, senior citizens. For five days I have been emailing to over three of their email ID’s and they have not responded to any. I have got on the call with them and they have not even reverted with the actions. And this is how my last call with Jet Airways ended... me: .... how is Jet Airways helping me as a customer! ?” Executive: “please hold on sir, let me transfer the call to my supervisor.” And then for the next fifteen mins I had to hear their “your call is important to us, your call is important to us...” Thankfully my agent was also in conference call and they said they would contact the airlines and get back.

### "worst airline I have seen"
Bangalore to Mangalore. This is the worst airline I have seen. no responsibility. They dont care of the customer at all. They changed the schedule of flight departures 6 times in 2 months, and at last cancelled the flight. And they are not even responding to calls and mails. Never recommend this airline.

### "rude replies from staff"
Delhi from Ahmedabad with one hour Stop in Mumbai. Suddenly we came to know that Mumbai Delhi Flight 9W 346 of 7.30 am got cancelled from Mumbai to Delhi. The new flight boarding pass has been given was of 8.45 pm. Which means we 11 passengers from Ahmedabad has to wait in airport for almost 12 hrs. No support, rude replies from staff of Jet Airways. We 11 passengers waiting from 7.am in Mumbai Airport and not sure if our new flight of which they have alloted boarding pass will fly at 8.45 pm. How can a Connecting Aircraft got 12 hours late and still No facility and no regret of Jet Airways staff.

### "definite signs of cost cutting"
Manchester to Mumbai. We were a bit anxious to fly them but it wasn't as bad as we thought. There are definite signs of cost cutting in the amenities available. The food was good and the bar service, seats comfortable with good IFE. The FAs were friendly and smiling. Cabin was reasonably clean an were the wash rooms.There was minimal toiletries available in the wash rooms.Though the departure was delayed we arrived on time. This direct flight to Mumbai from Manchester saves over 4 hours from taking a one stop flight.

### "airline customer service denial"
Toronto to Bangalore via Amsterdam for my engagement party to my (then) fiance. Jet Airways delayed my bag for nearly 4 days with all my clothes/engagement-wear. After filing a delayed bag form/trace case in the airport with about a dozen other folks who also lost some form of baggage on our last flight - 9W 235 from Amsterdam (AMS) to Bengaluru (BLR) - we were told to buy ncessary items (toiletries, clothes, etc) for our trip. Days 0-3: Had to call Jet Airways myself every morning and evening in order to get status updates, after repeatedly being told they'd call back themselves each day. Day 3: Finally got an update (I called) that they found the bag in Amsterdam. It'd arrive soon. Day 3: Filed my reimbursement claims/receipts for items bought for delayed bag. Day 4-ish: Delayed Bag arrived, we rejoice! Day 10: Flew back from India to USA. Day XX: 42 Days 11 Emails 6 Facebook messages 4 Tweets, 2 Twitter DM and I still don't have my reimbursement for my delayed bag. Welcome to airline customer service denial. I've only got a human response 4 times - 3 email responses and 1 tweet so far - with no end in sight. The Flight Reviews Flights themselves were decent to ok. Air Canada to Toronto: No real issues, quick domestic flight over. Seats were comfortable enough and I was surprised to have an onboard entertainment system to hook into. We arrived about 20 minutes late but Canadian customs was quick enough that I had no issues getting into the line for the next flight (which was thankfully gigantic, in this case) Toronto to Amsterdam: Again - no real issues. Seats at this point are getting a little smaller. Food was average (main course of butter chicken) to above average (dessert was great - a creamy mango sweet.) Amsterdam to Bangalore: Finally, no real issues. Here I did feel the seats started to get a little smaller but that also was the passenger composition - had a tall gentleman beside me who had leg issues in the middle seats.

### "knew it was going to be rough"
Dubai to Bangkok via Mumbai. I believe in you get what you pay for! I take monthly trips from Dubai to Bangkok andI always fly nonstop with another airline. I saw the flight I wanted with Jet Airways was only $350 USD or so round trip with one stop in Mumbai. I figured why not give it a chance? As soon as I got on the plane I knew it was going to be rough. The seats are horrible! They are worn out and filthy. The staff is very attentive I will give them credit for that. Once I got to Bangkok, my bag was pretty much destroyed like they threw it around for fun. Fast forward to me leaving Bangkok back to Dubai. Again, the seats are worn and filthy. They scheduled my connecting flight thru Mumbai way to close to the time we would land from Bangkok. I run through the airport and I make it to the gate. When I hand my boarding pass to the person, it doesn't scan. They had cancelled me off that flight and put me on a later one. I asked why did you cancel me if I'm here?? That in turn made me be late for a meeting I had in Dubai. I asked, since you guys changed my trip can I at least be compensated with an upgraded seat? No response of course, I was told to follow a gentleman for new boarding pass for the next flight. We walked all the way back through Mumbai airport and then I was told to wait at security while he brings me a new boarding pass. He comes back 10 minutes later and says it's the same gate as before. So now I have to walk all the way back through the airport again. I didn't have an upgraded seat, not even an emergency exit row for a little more space. When I finally get to Dubai I wait for almost 40 minutes for my NEW bags. When they arrive guess what?? It is destroyed as well. When I get home and open my bag, my clothes were covered in shampoo, lotion and everything else I had in my checked bag. I swear they were running it over with a cart or something. All in all, I would rather walk from Dubai to Bangkok before I would ever use this airline again. Their prices are extremely low and now I see why. Just remember, the inflight entertainment is a joke. The only movies or shows that would play were Bollywood ones. Everything else it would go back to the main screen and wouldn't play. I tried on 3 different devices so apparently it is on their end not mine.

### "service is substandard"
London to Mumbai. It was my first time experiencing Jet Airways and I think it is appropriate to say I won’t be using them going forward. The quality of service is substandard when comparing to other flight providers. The price was the same as other airlines but I chose to use this airline for the hours they were flying. I should have heeded the warning from relatives but knowing that I am not the first to recognise an issue in the services shows that the issue lies within Jet Airways. Their online check in system was ridiculous to say the very least. You’re allowed to check in up-to 48 hours before your flight but have to pay for your seat if you want to check in 12-48 hours before your flight? I’ve never heard of such a far fetched scheme. Of course by the time you wait for free check-in twelve hours before your flight, you can only have free seats in the most unorthodox seats so wave farewell to anyone you decided to travel with. Not to mention that you can only pick your meal and provide your emergency contact information if you check in online, so checking in at the airport means you are given what ever they have left in the back and only told this when you’re up in the air and if the situation where an emergency may rise you are screwed. The staff at the check in counters looked like this was the last place they wanted to be and they appear to have an allergy to smiling. I had to take 2 planes: 9.5 hours from London to Mumbai and then transfer to a 2.5 flight to Amritsar, that’s 12 hours in total. In this time they only gave one meal, one poor excuse of a meal where I couldn’t have more than 3 bites, and I usually enjoy flight meals. The second flight I had to pay for a coffee. Pressing the button to request services from the flight attendant worked in either two ways: waiting 15 minutes until they come, or the flight attendant arriving and pressing the button to cancel the call saying that they will assist you in a moment but surprise surprise, they keep away from until you have to get their attention again. On the first flight where I had to sit nearly 10 hours, I thought to ask for some alcohol to at least relax and make the most of the trip, only to be told that they don’t have anymore - this was 3 hours into the flight. I don’t even know what I paid for, no food no booze and no sense of the word service. The second flight also gave me the chance of witnessing others lack of being attended to. This poor couple had to ask 3 times for a pillow for their baby. They asked twice for some water, but repeatedly being forgotten about meant the only thing they could do to get through their flight was go to sleep, hopefully waking up to realise this flight journey was just a dream. Now I have been told that my return journey has been pushed up 3 hours, with no choice for an alternative flight. Not looking forward to it since I have to wake up 3 hours earlier than initially planned so I’ll have to skip my hotel breakfast only to wait for another 10 hour flight that serves one portion of gruel.

### "refused to issue boarding pass"
Mumbai to London. I booked a return ticket for my sister by my debit card. While getting the boarding pass,They asked to show authorization letter she did not have in hard copy, she showed my authorization in whatsapp at the counter but they refused to issue boarding pass. And she had to return back home. When i contacted their customer care and asked they refund the return ticket they told "you been penalized for no show".

### "extra nominal fee to pre book seats"
Not Verified |  My son who is 8 years old will be travelling with me on a Jet Airways flight to Ahmedabad from London Heathrow. After i completed my booking I called/emailed Jet Airways to help us to pre allocate seats so we can be guaranteed seated next to each other. Unfortunately, they were not very accommodating when it came to a Child involved in the travels and infact told us to pay the extra nominal fee to pre book the seats or wait for 24 hrs prior to departure. It is very sad to learn that such a well known airline seem to least care for passengers with special circumstances i.e Children, Disabilities etc and still want to make more money out of them. We are regular fliers and we fly mainly by British Airways, Emirates and Kenya Airways. These airlines also have similar policies but they do consider passengers with special circumstances and will help to their best to pre book the seats or give us 48 hours prior to departure so we are guaranteed sitting next to each other. When i questioned the gentleman i spoke too on how they would expect a 8 year old to sit with a complete stranger for 9 hours - the reply was it is fine as you will be in the same aircraft! I call this pathetic and clear lack of training on how to respond to customers. I strongly would not recommend Jet Airways for people with special circumstances and very discriminating. Also in addition - seating of young children next to their parents or guardians should be the aim of airline seat allocation procedures. This is because the speed of an emergency evacuation may be affected by adults trying to reach their children. So clearly there is no safety concerns for young children!! Its all about making the smallest "nominal amount" they can and not the principle!

### "poor cancellation policy"
Really poor cancellation policy, totally lacking in compassion. I came out to Canada with my wife as her mother was ill. I pre-booked a ticket back to the UK with Jet Airways as I needed to show a return flight (I am not Canadian). My wife's mother sadly died while we were here, and I needed to cancel the flight in order to stay for the funeral. They charged me $325 Canadian to cancel - and would not waive the fee. Apparently their cancellation policy is for 'close family only'. This feels very much like close family to me.

### "could never provide any useful information"
Apart from the shoddy inflight service and poor facilities on the flight, Jet Airways customer service is by far the worst I’ve ever come across. They lost my bag even though I paid an extra baggage fee and despite my umpteen efforts to communicate with them over the phone they could never provide any useful information. Jet Airways have really succeeded in creating an impression as the worst customer service experience I’ve ever received. A real embarrassment to the airline industry. Your company really needs to learn a few things about customer relations before you become an international airline company. Despite paying an additional $200 luggage fee they still lost my bag. This happened on 5th January 2019. I was told I would be reimbursed for my expenses as I didn’t have a single piece of clothing as a result of their negligence. After having purchased the bare necessities I provided them with the bills that I was going to need, I was told the matter would be resolved no later than the 17th January, but it wasn’t. When I called on the 18th I was given a date of the 23rd for the same and then the 28th. They just keep going round in circles. They really need to open their eyes and see how other airlines Lufthansa, American Airlines, British Airways to name a few give priority to their customers even if they are a little disappointed. You will never be receiving any business from my end at least. Thank you for nothing so far and take responsibility for your negligence.

### "food is not good at all"
Goa to London via Mumbai. The onboard food is not good at all, half of it was very hot (gravy) and the rest was cold and it did not taste very well too. The cabin crew were polite and served the meals at appropriate times. But the seats were not very comfortable for an 8+ hour journey. The onboard entertainment system was okay and had some of the latest movies out at that time but the monitors and headphones were horrible, the headphones were very cheap and seemed a bit damaged, the monitors were of the lowest resolution possible but were watchable. I do not want to criticize the airlines a lot though, looking at the difficulties they are facing right now due to the economy. Overall, I would recommend this airline for a budget journey but expectancies should not be high regarding comfort.

### "willing to pay to get the upgrade"
Paris to Chennai. I asked if they can upgrade to business class and the amount. They said it would be $625. After thinking I said yes. But by then they started take off procedures and later the air hostess came and said that they didn’t do it because of paper work. I was really frustrated as I was willing to pay to get the upgrade.

### "a former shadow of its past"
Not Verified |  Mumbai to London. Jet Airways is a former shadow of its past now, this was a great airline surpassing its rivals on this route. Check in at Mumbai, only two counters open, staff engaged in chats until manager arrives and four more counters open up! Before you board the plane your boarding card will be checked on 5 occasions, two by security and immigration and 3 by Jet Airways staff just before boarding. Seats leave a lot to be desired, our seats wouldn't recline, IFE was good, food was awful and portions tiny, The red wine served from a standard sized bottle had oxidised (probably from the previous flight) seat space is too cramped to eat. Cabin staff very sparse (I'm sure there were more on my previous trips). Jet mobile phone app a waste of time, didn't work for check in or on the plane. We certainly won't be using Jet Airways again for our travels.

### "Not again with Jet Airways"
Not Verified |  Mumbai to London. Not comfortable seat, unless you pay £30 for each seat. My wife order Lacto Vegitarian but it was spicy Indian meal, written on it Lacto Vegi. No facility to book free seat in advance. We went early at Airport but still didn't get better seat. Only one staff serving food, drink and tea. I supposed people travelling because they allowed 46 Kilo weight allowances. We took lots of clothes for charity. Not again with Jet Airways.

### "wouldn't do it again"
Mumbai to London. Check-in took forever, with only three people at work, although the line was quite long. Things began moving only when people began complaining. I know I flew Economy, but I have never felt so cramped. The website was unavailable for seat selection. The takeoff was two hours late, which means I missed my connecting flight. Although the flight was well over six hours, we received only one meal--which was good--and one meager snack, with no offers of drinks in between, although the Duty-Free guy made a point of pushing cigarettes and vodka. My bag was lost, but Jet Airways did nothing to try and help. I flew Jet Airways only because the price seemed good but wouldn't do it again.

### "the worst airline ever"
This is the worst airline ever. I checked in a luggage at Pune and the person check in in the luggage mislabeled the tag, that is, she labeled wrong baggage on my name. I've following up with them since the last 4 days but there has been no response from them. This is really the worst experience ever. How can they mislabel a check in luggage!

### "the worst you can experience"
1) The Jet Airways BOM to LHR flight was supposed to takeoff at 2.35am. All passengers were on time, no weather issues, but, they delayed it until 3am and that's when BOM airport authority declared runway maintenance for 1hr. Finally, the flight took off at 4.15 am, and I missed all other connections. First issue with Jet Airways is around punctuality 2) On board service is the worst you can experience on any airline possible. On a 10hr long flight, they served one meal that too was of poor quality. 3) Hygiene - is something that this flight has never seen I guess. I booked my flight with Delta Air Lines and they out sourced it to Jet Airways and I had to go through the saddest experience of my international flights so far. It's really sad to see an Indian Airline providing such sub-standard International flight experience to people of India and from other countries.

### "a farce from start to finish"
Just no, do not do it. What a farce from start to finish. Flying from Manchester to Bangkok via Mumbai, the layover was way too short. 1 h so no surprise we were delayed 2 hours which meant we had to get on the next flight 7 hours later. In this 7 hours they provided us with the cheapest meal burger king had and nothing else. They constantly lied to us. Then lied again saying I'd still get my emergency exit seat. The flight from Mumbai to Bangkok didn't have TV's. The cabin crew were unfriendly and wouldnt give you a drink aside from one in 4 hours. Coming back I couldn't check in because the app kept failing, which meant I couldnt sit with my wife and had a non reclining seat next to the toilet. Pay the extra £150 and fly with somebody else.

### "worst experience ever"
London to Amritsar via Mumbai. The worst experience ever. One of my two checked in bags never arrived at Mumbai airport and while I asked the customer service people there, no one seemed to care that I had to catch the next flight to Amritsar in 1 hour. They asked me to file a claim for my bag and as I was in line, my next flight took off, so I had to wait 4 hours at Mumbai airport till they found another flight to chandigarh after 5 more hours. However, its been 6 days now and I haven’t received my lost bag yet. I have been calling their office everyday and all they say is they need another 24 hours. This is horrible service and I had very important articles in that bag. I don’t know how to get it back. Do not ever trust this company with your baggage or time.

### "not let you select your seat"
Not Verified |  My flight was from Chennai to Miami on Jan 6, 2019 Chennai-Delhi-Amsterdam on Jet Airways 831/234 . Amsterdam -Miami on KLM 627. Ticketing done by Delta, but operated by Jet Airways and KLM. On Jan 6th during check in at the airport counter at 5 pm, the agent said the Jet Airways connection flight #234 from Delhi to Amsterdam was cancelled. There was no email or phone message regarding cancellation. It took them almost 2 hrs to reroute via Chennai-Paris on Jet Airways 128, and Paris-Miami on Air France 090. Jet air ways 128 is at 1.45 am on Jan 7th. Service, attitude of the Jet Airways staff was horrible. They did not seem to care. one would say some thing and walk away, saying some one else would help find the rerouting. They were going away on breaks. No one seemed sincere or interested in doing their job. Rerouted as Chennai- Paris on JA 128, Paris-Miami on AF 090.Connection time 2 hrs Later on, when i check on line it shows the flight 234 flew as scheduled. Its obvious the ticketing staff at the counter lied. I can't figure out why they had to lie and made me stand anxiously for 2 hrs. Another problem is- even though the bags are checked to the final destination, Jet Airways would not issue the boarding pass for the Paris-Miami segment, asking me to see a help desk at Paris airport. This flight 128 from Chennai to Paris went in late, and there was no help desk on arrival. I had to run to International transfer area, security and wait in line to get on a shuttle bus to get to the Air France Terminal. Business class boarding door was closed by the time I got there. I was probably the last person to board. Ticketing done on code sharing problem- Delta gives a confirmation number which does not work on Jet Airways, KLM or Air France. It took me a while calling Delta and my travel agent to figure out the PNR number of my reservation on Jet Airways. Both said that I have to get the reservation confirmation numbers from the other party, Delta says to get the PNR for JA from the travel agent. Travel agent says to get it from Delta. Finally Delta gave me a PNR number which did not work. So, I had to call Delta again, wait listening to music for over 30 mins, and was given a different PNR number, which worked to open my trip on Jet Airways. Despite entering the correct PNR number, Jet Airways does not let you select your seat.

### "don't go with Jet Airways"
Kathmandu to Varanasi via Delhi. Schedule changes all the times (they have a "policy" that allow them to anticipate or postpone a flight in 2 hours - and they can even decide it less than 12 hours before the original ETD). Every single flight has been changed at least twice (and one has been cancelled). I've lost a train connection because of them. They have a baggage scam: their website informs that tickets bought abroad allows 25kg of baggage.They do not honour the baggage allowance, and provide only a ridiculous 15kg (of course you can buy 5kg more; It will cost only USD 30/flight). I've flown with Jet Airways, Air India, Indigo and Vistara (no problems with the last 3). So if you want a smooth experience, don't go with Jet Airways.

### "announced cancellation of flight"
Chandigarh to Bhopal via Delhi. My mother was on wheelchair. They took her for boarding and as i along with other passengers were about to board they suddenly announced the cancellation of flight. I did not know the whereabouts of my mum and when i asked they repeatedly told me that they were going to bring her back. She did not arrive even after a wait of an hour and a half. Finally my wife went back to the check in counter after going reverse through the security and completing all the formalities and found her there. She told us that she was sitting in the wheelchair for about half an hour near the plane in rain as it started raining suddenly. There was a big confusion among the staff about the cancellation of the flight. The Delhi flight was announced again but they told us that we cannot board the flight as we would not be able to catch our flight for Bhopal due to delay in the Chandigarh flight. We then awaited for our luggage to come back for another three hours only to find that half of our luggage was not removed from the flight and it had been taken to Delhi. No one was telling us anything during all this as their whole staff was itself confused and was in a panic mode. When i enquired about this from their supervisor he was making excuse like a school child that due to all this mess up and heavy rains they were not able to unload all the luggage of the passengers. I told him that if they were so untrained that they were not able to handle such a simple situation what will happen if they have to deal with a real emergency.

### "dishonest, rip off airline"
This airline turned out to be, for me, the most dishonest, rip off airline I have flown with over the past 40 years of extensive travelling. In essence, if you can’t be bothered with the smallprints, you may find yourself completely ripped off. I booked returns from London to Ahmedabad via Mumbai, return. Flight out ok but basic with regards to service etc. However, I had to go through picking up luggage at Mumbai, picking up luggage and clearing customs (count a couple of hours) before re-issuing national boarding pass for follow on national flight to Ahmedabad (doesn’t work like most transfer flight arrangements, do it yourself is the motto). So far, so medium good. Now to the rip off part of the story. I wanted to change my return flight from Ahmedabad to London via Mumbai to directly flying out from Mumbai (as I was Pune three days before departure). So called them to let them know (as requested by terms and conditions) that I was cancelling the Ahmedabad to Mumbai leg of journey and the operator said all was fine and should check in at Mumbai directly. This seemed confirmed by email, inviting me to check in at Mumbai (and not Ahmedabad). At check in at Mumbai I was confronted with a >£300 penalty fare for ‘no-show’ at Ahmedabad. They maintained that if I wanted to get my flight back (none of this was mentioned on phone or email) I had to pay the penalty fare for the entire journey. So basically it was pay up or stay in Mumbai. Funnily, after being forced to pay the penalty fare, a stranded tourist asked for a quote on same flight and was offered a price of £190! So buying a new ticket was much cheaper than the penalty fare I just paid (not that the Jet Airways staff offered this alternative solution to me at the time, great customer care!). Since, I provided them with all requested information to reclaim my extra not justified costs. So far only got a nearly (English) incomprehensible drivel (quite comical) from customer relations with no detailed explanations.

### "Rather take a train"
Lucknow to Delhi. Horrible airline, always delay or cancel the flight last moment and dont even get you a proper refund on time. No staff is ever available on the airports to talk to - such bad service. Rather take a train than this flight.

### "inappropriate rescheduling"
Bangalore to Pune. As we were on a trip, we researched on the timings of the flight and booked this one so that we could reach home by 11:30 in the night and can join office afresh next day. We received a message 5-6 days saying it has been rescheduled to 26th Dec 2:10 AM due to operational reasons. We reached goibibo from which we had booked the flight to know the alternatives. As a solution, the provided flights were 25th or 26th morning which were not at all feasible. So we didn't have any option other than to travel along. We reached home at 5 in the morning and joined office at 9. The complete day was ruined due to this inappropriate rescheduling of the flight by the airline without considering the customer's comfort.

### "Think twice before you book"
Not Verified |  I had purchased my air ticket on Jet Airways flight 9W610 from Kolkata to Mumbai for 15/12/2018 more than six months ago so that I can catch an international flight from Mumbai at 11:45PM on the same day. The Jet Airways flight was originally scheduled to depart Kolkata at 6PM and arrive Mumbai at 9PM. On 12 December morning, I received a text message from Jet Airways that the flight 9W610 has been rescheduled due to operational reasons to leave Kolkata at 7:45PM and arrive Mumbai at 10:40PM. As with the rescheduling it was impossible to catch the international flight at 11:45PM, I approached Jet Airways to change my booking to an earlier flight. They made me to pay not only the fare difference, but also the cancellation charge. They told ne it is Jet Airway’s policy to make the customer responsible if the flight is delayed by less than two hours even if the reason of the delay is on their part (in this case it was Operational Reasons). Later on, I came to know recently Jet Airways is in financial trouble. So, it may be an innovative business model on their part to generate extra money by rescheduling flights by just less than two hours so that they can squeeze extra money from some passengers. If couple of passengers per flight change their bookings, Jet Airways can pay their staff. Think twice before you book your next Jet Airways flight.

### "I didn’t receive baggage"
Jeddah to Kozhikode via Mumbai. Lost baggage - pathetic response from their team. If you care your belongings,never ever travel with jet airways. Since 3 days I didn’t receive baggage.

### "don’t care about their customers"
Dubai to Mangalore via Delhi. The worst experience and wouldn't recommend anyone to travel in this airline. Service is worst, they don’t care about their customers. We had a connecting flight via Delhi and we were made to wait for almost 8 hours without providing any benefits. They did not even intimate us about the changes in the flight timings. would never travel again with JET

### "service was fine"
Singapore to Delhi. If you have less budget just like me, Jet Airways is the answer. The flight & service was fine. Food is okay, mineral water is only 100ml cup, so we have to ask the cabin crew often. But there no entertainment in flight, you have to instal Jet Airways app on your phone first if you wanna get it.

### "No Jet Airways again"
Not Verified |  Mumbai to Bangalore on 28th Nov 2:35 pm flight. As I was relocating to a new place, required to carry extra luggage.they charged me hefty amount for my extra luggage weight and even a charge for an extra piece of baggage. Earlier it was 25kg which has reduced to 15kg. Food and services have too gone down. Though in the flight I realized many seats were empty, they could have easily waived the charge. No Jet Airways again.

### "lost my luggage for two days"
Toronto to Amsterdam. For me to say this airline is bad, I mean it. I waited 2 hours in line just to check in. They only had two people working the check in counter in Toronto for over 200 people. The service was rude and impatient not just with me by with the other passengers during the flight. Then when I landed they had lost my luggage for two days. Please do not waste your time with these guys. They have no idea what customer service is about.

### "went through humiliation"
Kolkata to Pune. I purchased 17kgs extra for Rs 6800 and apart from that I went through humiliation at the airport because again I had to pay Rs 2500 for an extra bag. These people don’t get that if a customer is purchasing 17kgs extra thats but obvious that he/she will keep that in an extra bag. Worst experience. Very rude airport staff. Rather than explaining the staff started arguing that you have to pay otherwise we will not get you on board.

### "customer unfriendly experience"
Not Verified |  Mumbai to Kochi. The most customer unfriendly experience. I fly very frequently when I visit India, a couple of times a week. Most airlines are lenient with a couple of extra kilos in your checked in baggage if you do not have a hand baggage. I was travelling with zero hand baggage (I am allowed 7), but they made a huge fuss and insisted I pay for the two extra kilos in my check in baggage. They were very rude as well and quoted rules as being rules and you have to pay. I paid up but I really will not fly this airline again. They may have made a few extra bucks with the excess baggage but lost a lot more in future business. I know Jet Airways is in big financial trouble and on the verge of shutting down, but somebody needs to tell them that they will in no way get out of red by charging loyal customers for a couple of excess kilos.

### "no in flight entertainment"
Delhi to Singapore. there was no in flight entertainment, which the crew apologised for. As if the deprivation of the in flight entertainment wasn't enough, next came the blankets, which were to the plight of this airline only enough to facilitate the needs of the elderly (told there weren't enough for everyone), prioritising only the 'needy'. Hugely disappointed with this new found blanket distribution system. Though i have been in flights where the transfer takes place with the help of buses but never a bus that breaks down in the middle of the transfer and leaves you stranded on the tarmac for 10-15mins (after a flight like that).

### "worst boarding experience"
Amsterdam to Delhi. Bad boarding management ever. Single very long and very slow queue formed, yet people constantly allowed out of queue. No announcement for seating zones. Bus to aircraft over packed, and awaited green signal for departure to aircraft for at least 10mins after being filled up, although it was neither first nor last bus leaving. Old aircraft. Poor infotainment system with poor audio. So many people asked for feedback form on boarding that the crew requested people on PA system to visit company website to give feedback. One of my worst boarding experiences ever.

### "refused to let us check in"
Not Verified |  We were due to fly London to Delhi on 15th November 2018. The tube line to Heathrow was suspended due to a trespasser on the line so we arrived later than planned but we were still there an hour before our scheduled take-off time. Jet Airways refused to let us check in, saying that the gate had closed Even though we were with a tour operator who already had our flight tickets, we were denied access and could not check in. We spent £3,200 on the tour for a nine night/five destination tour and we have now lost all our money - the insurance company will not pay because they say they will not pay for transport disruption. We have taken this up with the tour operator who say that it is totally down to the airline. Has anyone had any problems like this with Jet Airways before?

### "undoubtedly the worst"
Kolkata to Dhaka. The experience I had today with Jet Airways which was undoubtedly the worst I have faced with any airways so far. I went to the airport to catch the morning flight (IST 7:00AM) we booked. To our utter surprise, we were told to pay a fine of 18,000 rupees when our luggage crossed the expected weight. On top of all these, the women in charge of the luggage submission, was extremely rude lacking the minimal courtesy and mannerism. She threatened us to cancel our tickets just because our luggage exceeded weight and also a guy rushed to check if there was any more bags in the area my wife was seated. They were screaming on us, it was so embarrassing for us. When I wanted to talk with manager that lady said "he is not interested in talk with us". What kind of customer service is this? When I wanted to give my bag to an acquaintance on another flight they strictly prohibited us from doing so. We boarded the plane last minute with the loss of an entire bag. This is my last time travelling with jet airways.

### "business class service is near excellent"
I flew 4 sectors as Hong Kong - Delhi - Dubai - Mumbai - Hong Kong with Jet Airways, in economy for the first 2 sectors and in business for the last 2 sectors. After completing the trip, the impression is that there is tremendous gap between business and economy class for this airline especially for the software side. While economy class service is something like that of LCCs' and the inflight maintenance of the lavatory is unacceptable, business class service is near excellent with pretty good care by the attendants and continuous check and cleaning of lavatory, besides dated and a bit of dirty hardware around seats.

### "This airline is a mess"
Toronto to Amsterdam. This airline is a mess. I had a return trip AMS-TO. When we were flying to Toronto, the boarding time started earlier as mentioned on the tickets and we were literally one hour before on the plane before our scheduled departing time. Plus, there was a delay that was not even announced or said what was the reason. So we were sitting inside for 2 hours + 8 hours travelling time. Crazy! It was hot inside and the crew is so unprofessional. The planes are old and earphones did not work both flights, had to ask them for new pairs, but, of course, it took some time as they could not find them. When we were landing in Toronto, the compartment opened and the bags started to move, so I had to unfasten my seatbelt and react quickly. My food was uncooked. The chicken was raw and veggies were still uncooked, hard to eat. As my Low calorie meal snack I got only 4 slices of apple when everyone else got a healthy wrap. Plus, on my way back, some crew members had problems with English. Hard to explain, but their attitude seems really informal. Definitely would not recommend. Also, the boarding at Toronto airport was a mess, we were still boarding when we actually had to depart already. Everything was moving so slowly.

### "never use this airline again"
Delhi to Udaipur. Although it clearly stated on my ticket booked with a 3rd party that I was allowed 23kg of luggage, at check in they told me I would have to pay beyond 15kg, which meant an extra $34 for 5kg! I showed them the ticket where it clearly stated this, but they said I cannot get on the flight if I don't pay them the extra money. I will never use this airline again.

### "Staff was excellent"
Amsterdam to Delhi. Flight delayed. Gate was heaving. A lovely member of ground staff gathered all business class passengers and and boarded us. She was excellent. Staff looking after our aisle was excellent and the other crew were great. There was an elderly lady who needed help going to the bathroom and the crew assisted her every time. Food was excellent. Lunch - salad, soup, mains with sides, cheese, fruit - ok by now I am stuffed. No space for snack before landing. Good drinks selection and fresh popcorn was a nice touch.

### "trying to avoid this airline"
Mumbai to Ahmedabad. I am a frequent flyer and most of the times my bookings are last minute, so I always pay a premium for the tickets. The grumpy ground staff made me stand in a queue for check-in and then instead of issuing a boarding pass they direct you to the self service kiosk for boarding pass and the baggage tag as well. The attitude of the staff was curt. On entering the flight and a till well after take off the AC was not working properly and it was sultry and suffocating, and again the reply from the staff that we will try to rectify it. The captain did make an announcement of inflight audiovisual entertainment and out of curiosity I tried it but it was not functioning. The snacks they were offering were some stale veg puff, and on enquiring if they have anything else they asked me to take it or leave itk. A foreigner couple were sitting in the adjacent seat enquired if non veg option is available were greeted with a condescending grin and told to pre-book their meals if they want such luxuries. Anyway the only good thing was that the flight was on time, and on completing this horrid ordeal made a mental note of trying to avoid this airline as much as possible. If you're traveling in India much better to take a low cost airline like Indigo or others. They score over this airline in all aspects, are courteous and have spacious seats as well

### "worst experience for me"
Amsterdam to Mumbai. The food quality, cabin crew service and to add to this the baggage handling made it a mess for our journey. Jet Airways as always has been the worst experience for me and would never travel from now on with Jet airways. Raising complain with the team, they do not get back to you for 8 days and then they say we cannot refund money for damaged baggage as it is over 7 days. Kind of fooling customers, horrible customer service and least bothered staff.

### "never travel Jet Airways again"
Indore to Delhi. When we arrived at Delhi airport our bag was not received on the belt which was a shock for us as it had all stuff as I was in Indore for more than a month so carried everything along with me. Even after dropping them mails several time didn't receive any proper response. After 21 days of lost baggage they are paying us with just Rs 2450 which is less than the price of my empty bag. This is completely disgusting. Will never travel Jet Airways again.

### "denied me to check in"
Today I had my flight at 7:40 am from Pune to Delhi. I reached airport at 7:05 am, and their staff denied me to check in. When I have 35 mins in hand how their staff can deny the passenger. The lady on duty told me to but new tickets. If we have 35 mins in hand than how they can deny the client to board the flight. I booked a new flight for Delhi from Go air which costs me 5997.

### "ruined my whole trip"
Amsterdam to Delhi. I never got my baggage and the airline staff had no information about it. The staff said I will be contacted on any updates about it but never heard anything from them. They have ruined my whole trip. Customers have to take care of their baggage on their own.

### "experience was not good"
Hong Kong to London via Mumbai. The most uncomfortable and stressful connection I've ever experienced. The first flight from Hong Kong was too hot and the second flight to London was too cold. The juice wasn't juice - just sugary orange liquid. The movies are OK and seats were as expected. The security in Mumbai was very slow and resulted in nearly missing my connection. Although a very cheap price the overall experience was not good.

### "flight was very comfortable"
Pune to Kolkata. The flight was very comfortable and the cabin crew were helpful and willing to help, with a smiling face. Keep up the good work.

### "the staff was very considerate"
Singapore to Mangalore via Bangalore. We had a wonderful experience with the staff in Bangalore. Due to typographical error, we were not informed about a cancelled flight to Mangalore from Bangalore by Expedia. And we as a family with my 10 year old child had to reach Mangalore the same day as we intended to attend a family wedding there. We flew from Singapore to Bangalorethe previous night, and on arriving at the Bangalore airport the next morning, we were informed that our flight was cancelled and the other flights were fully booked as the road lines and train network was cut off from Bangalore to Mangalore due to flood situation. it was really upsetting for my family. But the staff was very considerate, tried really hard with multiple phone calls and negotiations to accommodate us in the same day flight. My husband was finally rerouted in a flight to Mangalore via Mumbai and me and my child in the next flight to Mangalore. And we had a great family time and lovely memories at Mangalore with the least disruption possible in the given circumstances. Thanks to Jet airways and their staff for making it possible!

### "dreadful experience"
Not Verified | London to Kolkata via Mumbai. Appalling experience of flying Jet Airways via Mumbai airport for my wife and myself. Slow and incompetent immigration staff caused serious delays in our arriving in the Baggage Hall, where Jet Airways staff piled up baggage on top of others by the baggage carousel while we had to wait in the queue on the first floor. We had to struggle to extricate our baggage from the huge stack, where hundreds of others were all pushing and shoving each other. And yet, there was not a single airline staff to be found anywhere to assist us. In the process, my wife and I nearly missed our connecting flight. In view of our dreadful experience, I certainly would not recommend Jet Airways to any prospective traveller and definitely not Mumbai Airport for transit.

### "Very unprofessional team "
Hyderabad to Mumbai. We were intime to the airport and tried to do kiosk check in simultaneously in two different kiosks, my friend got the boarding pass with last seat and It was declined for me showing the reason for there no seats available and approach counter person to get help in this regard. After I approached the check in counter that lady said check in was closed due to delay in reaching counter, hence they can’t provide boarding pass, I was shocked and conveyed the reasons shown by kiosk as seats not available for not getting the boarding pass, but Jet Airways team saying seats available but check in closed. My friend traveling with me same flight and he got the boarding pass and he boarded the flight. After he boarded the flight he realised that the flight is packed and no seats available and then we realised that we have been cheated by Jet Airways brutally. If airlines looking for additional income this is not the way to cheat the passengers claiming they are not in time. If seats are full you have to provide alternative options and allow passengers to travel in next flight, nicely suggesting that I need to buy ticket for next flight as this ticket is not valid for next flight, they said seats full is no the case in the flight anytime but for next flight they themselves saying economy class is full I need to buy business class ticket which is again a robbery they want to initiate with passengers. Very unprofessional team at check in counter, pathetic behaviour, big time cheating to passengers for additional income. Suggest not travel in this airlines, at least try to avoid or give least preference.

### "not customer friendly"
Delhi to Chennai. Check in staff asked me for upgrading to Business class (by paying more 10K) since I have had some points. I don't know really how they are calculating that mad things - I denied. Their interactions are not customer friendly and nothing I found positive among their services. Worst experience.

### "Customer service is so poor
Singapore to Delhi. I would not recommend this flight to anyone. Customer service is so poor, they give you cheap juice and drinks. The aircraft we traveled was having just 1 washroom, passengers has to wait for 30-40 minutes to use washroom due to long queue always.

### "like an inconvenience to them"
Chennai to Heathrow via Delhi. Our initial connecting flight (Chennai - Delhi) was delayed by 1h30. We were scheduled to catch our next flight (Delhi - London) 1h55 mins after so we knew we would be cutting it fine and were assured a number of times by the cabin crew on the flight that the necessary arrangements had been made at the airport in order to swiftly connect us to the next flight. Upon arrival, no such arrangements had been made and we missed our flight. We were then asked to hang around the transfer desk until the necessary amendments could be made to get us to our destination. There were no seats in the area so we had to make do sitting on the floor, we were not offered any water or food (we were there for 4 hours in the end) and we were not kept informed on what was happening, which made the experience all the more stressful. We were finally told that we had two options, both of which would get us to London 24hrs after our scheduled arrival time. We took the initiative to look up flights on Skyscanner and found 12+ alternatives that would have got us there 12 hours earlier. We then went through these options with the staff at the help desk who, after almost 90 minutes, managed to finally secure us one of these options. They then had the nerve to suggest that we leave them a glowing review for arranging this when we essentially did their job for them. Thanks to all the Jet Airways staff for putting minimal effort into helping us and making us feel like we were an inconvenience to them. If at all possible, I strongly discourage anyone from flying Jet Airways.

### "Worst experience ever"
Delhi to Hong Kong. Worst experience ever, the flight was delayed by an hour because of which our connecting flight to Seattle missed. Then Jet Airways just abandoned at hongkong, no representative showed up to at least let us know what was happening. Will never travel with Jet Airways again.

### "one of the best experience"
Mumbai to Riyadh. I would like to convey my special regards to the in-flight service attendants. During my last flight in August 2018, from Mumbai to Riyadh, I was travelling with my family. During the flight, my wife falls unconscious due to low Blood pressure and I don't get what was happening, the in-flight attendants attended her with no time and did the first aid which helped her to become normal. This is my one of the best experience and unforgettable with the Airlines.

### "2kgs excess in baggage"
Chandigarh to New Delhi. Rude and non co-operative staff at the check in counter. I have flown many times but no flight has ever created a fuss over 2kgs excess in baggage although I dont have any hand baggage of 7 kg. On top of it the person was really rude.

### "nightmare with Jet Airways"
Doha to Bangkok via Mumbai. The operations and catering is a nightmare with Jet Airways, I was traveling to Bangkok from Doha using Jet Airways, All inflight food is Indian cuisine no international option. During transit in Mumbai, all the ground staff during call time are talking in Local language (Hindi). This is not a domestic route, this is an international route.

### "not a first class service"
Mumbai to Amsterdam on 18/8/18 night flight, 9W 232. Upgraded from business class to first class due to overbooking. Flat bed in private suite with sliding doors very comfortable, I slept almost 6 hours. Amenity kit not available with this airline, as Star Alliance and Flying blue gold member I found this quite strange. I ordered cold breakfast and when it arrived, jam jar was already open and almost empty, not a first class service.

### "fairly ordinary experience"
Dhaka to Mumbai via Kolkata. I had a fairly ordinary experience flying Jet Airways. Take-off was on time for the international leg, however, the domestic transfer from Kolkata to Delhi and back was delayed by half an hour. But the flight still landed on time. Onboard service and meal was nothing to write home about but they did maintain minimum quality with a smile. The food was basic affair. The economy seating felt cramped and not very comfortable. For long flights it can be problematic if you're trying to get some sleep. There was no inflight entertainment. I probably would fly again if for nothing else but the price.

### "hopefully be the last time"
Delhi to Bangalore. We traveled by Jet airways for the first time and it'll hopefully be the last time. First the flight was delayed by almost an hour due to late return of the aircraft. This is sufficient to tick off most passengers but sadly, the story only begins here. They took away one of our cabin baggage at the flight entrance while boarding because "there wasn't enough space inside the cabin".Thank you for further wasting our time. We didn't get adjecent seats while doing kiosk check in, but thankfully due to the air hostess's presence of mind we were able to resolve it somehow through a bit of juggling and exchanging. Maybe they should install more of her at the check-in kiosk, as she understood that people who fly together need to be seated together. Rest of the flight was real comfortable as their leg space was practically not even sufficient to cross the legs. And if the person sitting in front of you decided to recline their seat then only God could help you. And just for extra goodbye kicks the belt no. announced after flight landing was wrong. Because who doesn't enjoy layers upon layers of chaos?

### "flight was quite good"
Amsterdam to Mumbai. Boarding began much earlier than other airlines on long haul sector, almost an hour and half before. The flight was quite good. Cabin service was good and attendants responded to requests, although the aircraft was nearly full. Food was okay but I personally dislike those cold wraps served before landing. The aircraft was neat and clean and based on whole experience, I will again fly with Jet Airways and recommend.

### "the worst experience"
Bangalore to Delhi. My first experience was the worst experience with Jet airways. I was not even allowed to group check in with my friends at the baggage checking. I was forced to pay a fine of 1500 INR because of 3 kg more of the specified limit even though my friend who was travelling with me had baggage of weight 12 kg. We were not allowed to check in together and weigh the baggage together for 30 kg limit.They do not even listen even if our flight is being delayed. I never wish to travel with Jet airways again.

### "Worst ever flight"
Abu Dhabi to Pune. Worst ever flight. We were boarded on time, as soon as we entered aircraft took a seat it was so hot and even AC was not at all working. Flight was delayed by 35-40 min to take off, no one was attending and we took safety cards to blow air on face and feel comfortable. I'm Frequent flyer in Domestic flights but never felt like this journey in my life.

### "Not at all comfortable"
I traveled from Pune to Delhi. It was really pathetic experience. Not at all comfortable. Delay It was announced in the flight that we had arrived in Delhi 20 min before scheduled time and we had landed 10 min late, the flight is already long as compare to other airlines such as Indigo (2 Hours 10 Min including luggage collection time) and jet airways time is 2 Hours 30 min airtime + 20-30 min Luggage collection. You can not schedule your taxi based on their schedule.

### "rather fly another airline"
Colombo to Mumbai. I would think twice before booking Jet Airways. This was my first flight with Jet Airways, which is part of the KLM group. It easily was the worst flight of my twenty years of flying to CMB. The gate agent, boarding process, and take off were timely and efficient. The food and beverage service is a letdown. The FA would look away to the next passenger when handing over the food and beverage. But I think it's also because the passengers around me were rude. The three passengers in the row ahead of me were competing with each other too see who could be more demanding in second glasses of whisky. Also, the passenger to my left. They would gulp their first whisky and immediately demand a refill. The FA efficiently tended to their demands, but she looked glum about it. I think she tried to avoid as much contact as possible with the passengers, and apparently tried to get through her required duties as quickly and brusquely as possible. The beverage options seemed to be just pours from one giant bottle of whisky, the usual sodas, and the fruit nectars. One Coke seemed the safest choice for me. The food options, were either chicken or vegetarian. I could not understand what the glum FA was saying so I just ordered chicken. The chicken was ok. Spicy but not too much. I don't know if Jet Airways offers special meals. I was unable to order it through the KLM website. Otherwise, no real issues with the airline. I just couldn't really relax on the flight. I would rather fly another airline if given a similarly priced choice.

### "regular Jet airways service"
Mumbai to Goa. Flight delayed by over 1.5 hours due to the weather - the airline did little to inform people but I guess there was not much they could do. Flight okay - regular Jet airways service. The cabin crew are nice enough and actually made small talk on this short hop. Short flight yet a quick meal served.

### "Jet Airways failed miserably"
We checked in at about 8am for our Amsterdam-Bangalore flight that was to depart at 10.50am on 29th May. There were other transit passengers who had come from elsewhere in Europe and US. The flight was to take off from Gate G12 - this must be the worst gate at Schipol airport - the gate area in poor repair, far away from restaurants & shops and no aero bridge to board the aircraft. At Schipol, Jet Airways have their staff, but perhaps in limited numbers - KLM provides ground support to Jet Airways. No Jet Airways staff were visible at our gate. Starting 10.45am, they made a series of announcements about flight delay. Finally at about 12 noon, they asked us to collect refreshment coupon from the gate counter - and it was worth Euro 2.50 - for that amount you get a bottle of water at Schipol, and most of us hadn’t had any breakfast. Some passengers starting tweeting furiously - perhaps, as a reaction to this, at about 12.45pm, KLM staff asked us to collect lunch coupons. But they also told us not to leave the gate area as they would have flight updates soon - remember that there are no food outlets in or close to gate G12! Eventually at about 1.45pm, they announced flight cancelation and asked us to go to transfer desk 4 to arrange alternate flights. KLM ground staff turned us away from Transfer desk 4 as it was very crowded and asked us to go to transfer desk 6. This was no less crowded. We stood in the queue for about 4 hours, we were inching towards the desk, at which time the KLM staff decided to close the desk and asked us to go to transfer desk 4! And another long wait began. Some passengers were being accommodated in the flight departing the same day - on such crazy routing as Amsterdam-Kuala Lumpur-Colombo-Bangalore (while the original flight was a direct non-stop flight). No one was being upgraded. But the viciousness of KLM ground staff was their own. And, through all this chaos, no Jet Airways staff was visible. Finally at about 9.30pm, I was given boarding passes for a KLM flight to Dubai the following day, a very long transit in Dubai and connecting onto an Emirates flight to Bangalore. I was asked to meet some other KLM staff in the arrival area for a hotel. I had a valid visa and could do that. But many others had to spend hours to get a visa & then were told it was too late to give them hotels - they spent overnight at the airport - no dinner coupons either. No one was given toiletries or money for change of clothes. Flights can get cancelled sometimes, but how an airline handles the situation determines the quality of the airline. Jet Airways failed miserably. So did KLM ground staff.

### "Do not fly with Jet airways"
Not Verified |  I selected Jet Airways purely because it's price was cheap over some middle eastern airlines. The lesson learnt was "Never fly in cheaper airlines". Firstly, the food was not so good but I am OK with it. Seats were not comfortable at all, even in the Boeing 777 seats cushions were flattened I could not survive in that seat not even for 2 hours of 8.50 hours flight. Entertainment were OK. Some of the cabin crew acted that they do not want or like to work in that airline. Negative attitude. The drams started when I went to check in at Schipol for the flight to Mumabai and then to Colombo. The check in counter staff said that I have to pull out my check in Luggage in Mumbai and again pass it to flight to Colombo which i defended and said there is no need for that and why so do it. She said that is the way they do that. Then I said OK as I did not have any option. Then she went on to say that I do not have to go out of the airport to pick the bag which sounded like rubbish. I said what nonsense? I am transit passenger and do not have a visa to go out of the airport in Mumbai and I have no reason to do that. Then she went on to say that domestic transfers operates like this way. I said this is not a domestic transfer but an International. At that time only she knew that Colombo is not a part of India. By that time she has put a sticker in between the flight detail tag in my luggage "Domestic transfer". I said to change that because I had a doubt that luggage will not join my flight from Mumbai to Colombo. Then she said I have to pick up my Mumbai-Colombo boarding card in Mumbai. Then I defended, she said she cannot issue that. Then asked me to wait for 10 minutes but it took about 30 minutes me standing. Then she called me again and said she can check in my luggage (I just had one bag) all the way to Colombo. But cannot issue the boarding card for the Mumbai-Colombo flight and I have to collect it in Mumbai. I strongly opposed it and requested the intervention of a manager who was apparently standing next to her but reluctantly intervened. Then he said boarding card for the 2nd flight cannot be issued now due to system error. All this time these two jokers were very negative in attitude. It is all their problems, not mine. Eventually I collected the 2nd flight's boarding card in Mumbai. I stated them that this will be my first and last flight with Jet airways. It was very inconvenient and stressful situation. It was my mistake to select a cheaper airline, Jet Airways was cheaper in all means. Do not fly with Jet airways for cheaper price, pay some extra and fly a reputed airline. In a problematic situation they handle it well with less hassle for passengers. Jet Airways, ground staff is useless bunch of employees.

### "Worst International flight"
Delhi to Singapore. Worst International flight experience I have ever had. It was simple a domestic aircraft and crew deputed to international route. The cabin crew is rude anddo not give blankets to everyone  and forget about pillows because they dont have that. No in flight entertainment (They may say jet screen so prepare to have you phone 100% charged and use your hands for 6 hours). They do not give nuts with drunks as default, its only on demand. Last but not the least they can refuse you a drink as well in case everyone in the flight had 1 drink before,because they were carrying only one bottle. Big thumbs down for Jet Airways Delhi nto Singapore route.

### "Absolutely rotten flight"
Absolutely rotten flight. The plane was dirty. From the very beginning one toilet was inoperable and then the flight was diverted to Kolkata because all toilets became inoperable. The pilot showed total lack of reasoning in making this diversion- it achieved nothing as it took a long time to land in Kolkata, then passengers were not allowed to leave the aircraft to use airport loos. By the time the on board toilets were repaired we were well past the time we would have reached Delhi. Then, in Kolkata a series of late procedures were revealed - all of which required us to sit waiting in a hot and stinking aircraft to avoid 'immigration' while the crew basically vanished. The pilot apart from a series of whiny announcements defending his decision to land gave us no updates about departure time etc. At the time of writing this we are still stuck here - the pilot has now vanished and nothing has been done to relieve the stress of the passengers. Zero rating on all counts.

### "zero hospitality"
Jaipur to Mumbai. Rude cabin crew, zero hospitality, poor service. Suggestion: don’t be a cabin crew if u do t like your job. Flights are comfortable in seating but attitude of staff is not acceptable. I would like to avoid travel by Jet Airways as much as possible

### "very pathetic experience"
Today I had the worst experience form Lucknow to Delhi and connecting to Ahmedabad. The plane was so so hot and humid. The airconditioning was just negligible. Sitting in the plane for 3 hours was unbearable. I pity those people who had their first experience in a plane, because definitely it would have left such a horrible impression. Even the above head fan was so hot and bad, we had to close it also. Horrible and very pathetic experience.

### "overall good experience"
Not Verified |  Bangkok to Leh via Delhi. We flew with bikes and they were undamaged. We didn't have to pay any excess baggage so that was nice. The desk agent in Delhi was very nice and helpful. Overall good experience.

### "never travel Jet Airways in future"
Not Verified |  Delhi to Singapore. We travelled from Delhi to Singapore return. The aeroplane was very old and Noisy. Seats are Hard and Cramped. Food was really pathetic. No USB Port. No Foot Stand to support Feet. Shockingly the Blankets and Pillows were so limited, even Children were difficult to get it. No Sanitizers or Hot Water in the Bathrooms. The situation was same in the return Flight also. We'll never travel Jet Airways in future.

### "not recommend this airline"
Paris to Chennai. Jet Airways is a okay airline. Our bags missed our connection and did not arrive to Chennai. The service was great though the food was not great. We had problems with choosing food because we had booked with Air France and they would not let us choose a food option. This was also the same problem with the seat. The seat was random and we were sitting in front of the bathroom. I would not recommend this airline to my friends and family.

### "Worst customer service"
Jet Airways are the worst airline I have flown with ever. To start with, my flight was delayed by 2 hours flying from MAA (Chennai) to CDG (Paris) and I missed my connecting flight. The airline staff were not a bit responsible and were pretty rude. They won't rebook your missed flight and told me that it is my responsibility to check my connection after I arrive in Paris. Worst customer service. No notification of my flight delay to my E-mail. To add: The food service on the flight was pathetic. Additionally, the entertainment screen for the seat next to me didn't work and the flight attendants couldn't care less.

### "conveyed a poor impression"
Delhi to Chennai. Callous in flight attitude towards passengers (also called guests by Jet Airways). Flight 9W829 took off from Delhi to Chennai on 04, June 2018 around 7:30 PM. Passengers who were sat at the rear of the aircraft pointed out a leaky toilet to crew long before take off - nothing was done about it. More on this later. The flight left Delhi for Chennai without a single crew member who understood Tamil (destination language). This was relevant as there were a group of flyers in the rear who spoke only Tamil and were trying to communicate something to the crew. Whilst safety demo was being conducted passengers were freely moving about in the cabin making it difficult to observe. Passengers sat on rows 35-37 received in flight service after trays had been cleared just about every where else. No logical explanation provided. Crew serving the rear of the Aircraft disturbed by Crew serving the front to cater to bespoke requests from passengers in the front at the cost of not serving passengers at the rear. 160 people had to content with one toilet during flight. At one time there was a long queue of about 30-40 people waiting to use the only functional toilet. I spoke to the so called cabin supervisor and requested that at least elderly and children be allowed to use toilets in the front. I suggested an announcement be made to that effect. It all fell on Deaf ears. Jet Airways conveyed a poor impression. Their crew appeared unprofessional and untrained. Their supervisor needs to get back to basics as does their crew training.

### "Indigo is a better choice"
Bangalore to Mumbai. On the way to the airport itself, we knew the flight would be delayed because of the Instrument Landing System malfunction in Mumbai (thought my colleague on an Indigo flight around the same time did not have much of an issue). The 10.45 pm flight was delayed by over 2 hours. Unfortunately the lounge at Bangalore while spacious has terrible food and beverage service compared to other domestic lounges and was crowded due to several delayed flights. The domestic flight was alright given it was a night flight one slept through most of it. The food was quite bad and tasteless and the leg space seems to shrink with every Jet Airways flight. Beyond the airmiles which you earn on Jet Airways - I really think Indigo is turning out to be a better choice for domestic travel.

### "a pretty good experience"
Mumbai to Delhi. Jet Airways has recently created a separate check-in area in Mumbai for Business and Elite Frequent Fliers and those who have paid for the Priority Vantage service with all counters accessible to any of the above groups. The flight was on time and the check-in was smooth and efficient and the Domestic Lounge at Terminal 2 in Mumbai remains the best airline lounge in India (in my view). The boarding process was smooth and quick. You are offered a welcome drink (coconut water or juice) and a cold towel before takeoff and there were three choices for food (including a healthy option which is a great idea). I had the omelette and some nice masala tea. The domestic business seats were comfortable enough for a 1.5 hour long flight. Overall - a pretty good experience for a domestic business flight.

### "worst airline I have travelled"
Amsterdam to Toronto . This is without a doubt, the worst airline I have ever travelled with. Horrible customer service. Food was terrible and made both me and my wife sick. We had a quick connection in Amsterdam and asked the airline to confirm that our baggage made it on the plane - which they confirmed - only to arrive in Toronto and discover that our luggage had NOT joined our flight (after waiting at the baggage carousel for almost 1hr). They offered nothing in terms of compensation without us having to email multiple times asking them to reimburse the money we spent replacing toiletries etc that didn’t arrive when we did. We have now been in an endless loop of nonsensical emails with what we can only assume is a robot giving us canned answers. They finally agreed to give us $100US for 2 people for the delay - and we emailed back a month later to ask where it was and they acted like they had no idea what we were talking about. Save a little extra money, and fly with anyone else but them. You will be guaranteed to get frustrated, upset, and if anything goes wrong, you’re up the creek without a paddle.

### "steady deterioration"
I have been flying Jet Air for about 20 yrs now. At various times I have been Silver/ Gold/ Platinum Member of their frequent flyer programme and 'am currently a Silver Member. The point is, I am familiar with this airline and have been a witness to their fast rise and steady deterioration, over the past few years. I was originally booked to travel by 9W 621 on 1 Jun, which is their 9 pm flight from Mumbai to Kolkata. Since my work finished early I reached Mumbai airport at about 5 pm and explored if I could prepone to an earlier flight. Sure enough, there was space on 9W 617 the 7.10 pm flight. My original ticket was for Rs 5783. They charged a whopping Rs 2500 (43% of original ticket cost) as preponing charge. I didn't like such a steep charge but paid in the hope that I will reach home 2 hrs earlier. So there I was, waiting at Gate 51 at Mumbai T2, for boarding to start at 6.25 pm for my 7.10 pm flight. At 6.20 pm, the staff at the boarding gate suddenly vanished. When I saw this I knew I was in a problem. Around 6.40 pm there was an announcement of departure delayed to 7.55 pm. That is by 45 mins. Bad but just about bearable. I was thinking, there goes some of the advantage of preponing at 43% extra cost. After half hour, they started boarding and I was seated at about 7.30 pm. I thought ok, at least they are not delaying further. Cabin was very cold. Probably at 20/21 Centigrade. So I requested for a blanket. Guess what, the cabin staff said they had uploaded only 12 blankets and that all were issued out. In a plane carrying 168 people (B737-800), they have uploaded 12 blankets! So much for Jet Air's claim of being a full service airline. Boarding completed by 7.45 pm odd. Plane full of people kept waiting as the clock gradually reached 7.55 pm, the promised departure time and crept well past. We all waited and froze as the cabin was kept well chilled! Requested the cabin staff twice to increase the cabin temperature to 24 Centigrade since they cant issue blankets. Nothing happened. At about 8.15 pm, the Captain announced that there is congestion at Mumbai and we will be delayed by another 20 mins. So now, I had paid Rs 2,500 (43% extra over my fare) for reaching home early. Instead, I was slowly freezing on the ground at Mumai while creeping closer to my original booked flight of 9 pm. Finally at about 8.30 pm we pushed back. Some more delay on the ground. We were airborne about 8.50 pm. By that time I was frozen and awfully hungry. Been waiting at the boarding gate since 5.30 pm. Mercifully, after take off, they increased the cabin temperature to 24 C odd. Jet Air then served dinner. A small 6" x 3" melamine container containing chicken biriyani (which contained exactly one piece of boneless chicken of size 1" x 0.5" x 0.5") and a salan (curry) with two tiny halves of brinjal (size 1" x 0.25"). Plus approx 4 table spoons of an indeterminate grey sweet viscous mass which could have been custard or souffle or heavy cream or just aerated vanaspati. Oh, there was tea and coffee as well with your choice of sugar or sugar-free. Magnanimous! We finally landed at Kolkata at about 11.10 pm. Almost 25 minutes earlier than my originally booked flight. A privilege for which I paid 43% extra, froze, caught a cold and almost starved.

### "worst customer service ever"
Kathmandu to London via Mumbai and Delhi. Flying from London to Mumbai, there was an overbooking, and they were looking for volunteers willing to leave on a later flight in exchange for a compensation. This problem turned into a blessing for me, since I was leaving for a long holiday and was not short of time, but it could have been an incredible nuisance. But, from the start, Jet Airways presents itself as an airline with inconveniences. On the way back. I was due to fly from Kathmandu to Delhi on Wednesday 2nd May, on the 09.55 flight, on the 9W263, and then I had only one hour connection before boarding the VS301 at 12.55 from Delhi to London. In Kathmandu, without any explanations, we left with around 50 minutes delay. Once we arrived near Delhi, we were not given the clearance to land as there were other flights scheduled to land at that time. We couldn't fly for too long waiting for the clearance, as the fuel was about to finish, so we were diverted to Jaipur, where we waited for more than an hour, on the plane, finally returning back to Delhi at 3 pm. By this time we had only been given the usual light breakfast on the flight, and nothing else. On arriving in Delhi, Jet personnel took me and the other people directed to London to the transfer area, and they gave us a sandwich and a small bottle of 200 ml of water. It was 3.30 pm. In the transfer area there is a tiny bar that only accepts rupees, and none of us had them, as we were not supposed to stop in Delhi for long, and we couldn't go out the transfer area to change any money. Jet representatives didn't give us any news on what was happening, always remaining quite vague. I asked what form of compensation they would have provided us for this problem, and he rudely answered that there was not going to be any compensation, that it was not a Jet problem if Delhi airport had not given them clearance. I told him, and I repeat it here, that not getting clearance was a consequence of Jet Airways delays in leaving, so the problem started with their unexplained delay. He then said that it was not their problem if there had been bad weather in Delhi, and it was the first time I heard this excuse, at around 5.30 pm. Nobody had mentioned bad weather until then, and when we were above Delhi it was around 11.30 am, and there were no signs whatsoever of storms or bad weather in general, so I told him that I didn't accept this explanations either. At 6 pm I started being thirsty, and asked for some water, and I was told to go and drink it from the fountain near the toilet. At 7.30 pm I asked for some food and again something to drink, and he mumbled that we first had to get the boarding passes and then we could go to a restaurant. But the boarding passes were going to be obtained only 3 hrs before our possible departure, so at around 10 pm. This means that at 7.30 pm we still had no idea if and at what time we were going back home. Then, the staff left together, giving no explanations and staying away for more than an hour. In conclusion: 13 hrs delay, they lost my rucksack cover, and did not provide us with any food or water for 7 hours. To finish it off, they refuse any compensation. The worst customer service ever.

### "vacation plans down the gutter"
I was to fly from Delhi to Chennai on 18th May. The scheduled departure of the flight was at 9.35 am from IGI. I had my return ticket on 21st May. I reached the check in counter exactly 45 minutes before the departure of the flight due to the Delhi traffic and was denied boarding. The standard rule is to close the check in counter 45 minutes prior to the departure of the flight, we all know. The staff were so arrogant that all they said was that I was late, as if it were them who chose me to fly with them. I pleaded them to consider my case as I was not too late according to rules. After having an altercation with me for 5 minutes they said to me that there were only 40 minutes left for the flight and hence they were following the rules by not allowing me. Any other flight that day was to cost me at least 13,000 INR. I had to cancel my trip because I was not in a mood to shell out that amount of money for the onward ticket. And since I was unable to take my onward journey because of the invented stupid rule I had to cancel my return tickets for which I didn't get any refund. I lost my entire money and all my vacation plans went down the gutter.

### "going from bad to worse"
Mumbai to Bangalore. Jet Airways just keeps going from bad to worse with every trip. Frankly both Indigo and Vistara do a much better job than this supposedly full service carrier. Despite being a Platinum flier my seat got reassigned from near the front to the back of the plane for no reason in spite of checking in more than 24 hours prior. The cabin crew woke me up for breakfast which was this disgusting sandwich for a low cal meal. At least on Indigo you get some decent choices for your money. I don’t remember the last time the airline offered a complimentary upgrade. And all this after paying almost 250 USD for a one hour fifteen minute flight. Congrats Jet Airways you always find a way to lower the bar. The only decent thing about the flight was the excellent Lounge in Mumbai but frankly that’s just not enough to put up with the rest of the awful experience. As usual the airline will not bother.

### "Shame on you Jet Airways"
London to Mumbai, nice flight, above average. Then it all went wrong, badly wrong. We were held on the aircraft whilst stairs to alight and buses to take us to the terminal. Immigration was in turmoil, missed our connection to Goa, next available flight 12+ hours later. Customer centric” Jet in there wisdom just left us at Mumbai airport for all this time, with nothing and no assistance at all, nothing. After many emails back and forward, all I know is Jet says “ it’s beyond our control, which I do understand,it’s the way we just had to fend for ourselves, this “caring” airline did nothing, as according to Jet they have no obligation to assist us so that’s what we got nothing, to the letter of the law they are correct, morally - ethically, it was wrong. And Jet just troll out the same, we don’t have to help our “guests”. Is this the kind of airline you would like to fly with. Shame on you Jet Airways.

### "Felt like a budget airline"
Delhi to Dubai. Extremely old plane, hard uncomfortable, poorly reclining seats in business class, dirty cabin and seats, very bad, inedible food, no entertainment system, untrained cabin crew. Felt like I was travelling on a budget airline as opposed to a full service airline in business class.

### "Seats worn down and uncomfortable"
Amsterdam to Colombo via Mumbai. Flights were very old 777-300 and a 737, on 777 lots of sounds coming from panels on take off and during turbulence. Seats were very worn down and uncomfortable. Flight from AMS to BOM cabin crew was very young and looks like high school kids and they never came to check your seat belts before take off, during turbulence or before landing, During the 8.5 hr flight never did a water service only way to get any water was by using the call button. I must say food was decent and gave some nice snacks during the flight. Entertainment system was very old and very small screens, Flight from BOM to CMB was a different story, cabin crew was attentive and did a great service during the short flight.

### "my first and last trip with Jet"
Bengaluru to Patna. This was my first and last trip with Jet Airways. Indigo is much much better despite being a Low-Cost Carrier. Food is average, cabin crew always serious, they are doing a favor by offering you food as if they have paid for the entire price of all the passenger's ticket.

### "I had the worst experience"
Amsterdam to Toronto. I had the worst experience on this airline and will not be returning. They lost a ton of luggage’on our flight and one happened to be ours. It’s been over 72 hours and they still haven’t contacted us on it. When I got on my flight from Amsterdam to Toronto there was garbage in my seat pocket, the  airplane was dirty and disgusting. Not taken care of. Seats were very uncomfortable and you were so close the the person next to you. It was a very uncomfortable claustrophobic 7.5 hour flight. I regret booking this flight regardless of how cheap the tickets were.

### "seats were uncomfortable"
Delhi to Singapore in March 2018. Delhi airport is a mess, there is even a queue to enter the airport. Anyway finally made it into the airport and tried to look for my flight check in counter, I couldn't find it! Then I figured out that Jet Airways ground staff do things in a different way, regardless of where you flying there are just 2 lines, domestic and international, your flight number is irrelevant. There were at least 200 people in the international check in before me. Finally got to the check in counter and checked in my baggage and got my boarding pass. Again, there were long queues at immigration. Boarding was disorderly and one crew member was blocking the aisle for a good 10 minutes as she was busy talking to a passenger (probably her friend). The seats were uncomfortable even for a 5.5 hour flight. No pillow, blanket or any other amenities were provided. There was no IFE, only device streaming but no tablets were available and my laptop's battery was out of charge. No power points in seats. Food was disgusting and inedible. At least they had Tiger beer, stewardess was generous enough to replenish my beer twice. Another crew member was very helpful and outstanding. The only other consolation from this flight was the stunning views of Mt Everest. Thankfully they didnt lose my luggage. It arrived quickly without any damage.

### "comfortable and easy flight"
Delhi to Kathmandu. I have travelled many times with Jet and always had a perfectly fine experience. On this occasion I received even better service than usual. The staff serving me was exceptionally friendly and helpful. She noticed I hadn't eaten much and went off to find me an alternative without me asking. Comfortable and easy flight.

### "Food was average"
Doha to Mumbai. It was my first experience with Jet Airways. It was an old A330. Food was average. The screen was not responding quickly, it was like the old TV. There was less staff in the cabin. Only 2 crew members in the Economy section.

### "A tired and old plane"
As a JP Platinum member, I chose to fly Jet Airways for my trip to Indonesia, despite the fact that Singapore Airlines was available at just 10% more. Never have I regretted the decision more. A tired and old plane and seats which had very little support, you practically had to fight with the IFE screen to get it to work and there is very little place to store your stuff. The meal was just about edible and there was no tea/coffee or juice offered towards the end of the flight. Never again will I subject myself to Jet Airways experience on long haul, I shudder to say this but I have found Air Asia more comfortable than Jet Airways.

### "pitiful meal"
Mumbai to Amsterdam. Booked through KLM and assumed we would be having KLM on the return but on checking in we found it was Air India. The lack of queueing to board was shambolic and despite the staff being pleasant the refreshments were non existent after the snack given. Five hours in I had to ask for a cup of coffee. An hour after that a pitiful meal was given of plain omelet with what I think was a vegitarian sausage and aweful tasting anemic potato thing. I could not eat any of it. Toilet nearest me ran out of water so no hand washing and it stank. Ruined my experience after an eight hour wait at the airport. Never again

### "clean spacious aircraft"
Dhaka to Kolkata. Excellent, short flight, on a clean spacious aircraft that arrived and departed on time. Boarding was orderly through jet bridge. A small boxed meal consisting of a chicken sandwich, a bottle of water, and a cookie were served by helpful flight attendants. Crew - cockpit and cabin - were introduced by their names and the passengers were kept informed about the progress of the flight. I would have liked the crew to have distributed landing cards for India on board the flight. On arriving, passengers had to accost officials to find out where one could obtain this form to fill out for presentation to the immigration authorities.

### "No refund or compensation was provided"
So on our honeymoon flight from Delhi to Bangkok (wife's first time flying) we were in first class. Two men in first class had a friend who kept coming into the front and between them they were served far too many drinks and talking very loudly. Long story short, passangers in first class were getting annoyed and a Canadian or American guy in the row beside me complained twice to the attendants. The attendants would just look around and didn't know how to inject any authority. They would very timidly just ask speak to them. I eventually looked at one of the guys and said why don't you listen to them and go back to your seat? Which is when he left. The guy in the row beside me and I talked to the attendants after and explained to them that they should be the ones controlling the situation. There response was something along the lines of "it's hard to control men in India" (shouldn't have have served them so many drinks) and then when we explained you can threaten them that the police will be waiting will be waiting when we land we got "that takes too much paperwork. Jet Airways has said they talked to the attendants and nothing to further escalate/investigate has happened. I told them I paid a first class price for sub premium economy service. No refund or compensation was provided. There was also no in seat entertainment which I found unbelievable. Waste of $2800.

### "slow customer service"
Hong Kong to Delhi. Terrible slow customer service. Even if you book a refundable ticket, they charge you a fee to process the refund so you receive almost nothing at the end of the process. If you decide to book with them, don't bother going for the refundable ticket as it means nothing.

### "it was inconsistent"
I travelled from Coimbatore to London Heathrow via Mumbai. I had a baggage allowance of 2 bags of 23 kgs each. I carried only 1 bag which was slightly above 23 kgs. I had not repacked my bags coz when I had travelled business class on same airlines in July 2017, I was allowed to carry more than 32 kgs in 1 bag. The bag weight this time was around 26 or 27 kgs. The staff did not accept it and I had to stuff the extra weight in my hand baggage and check that in too. And coz I did not have any other bag, I had to carry my laptop and other stuff in my hand till I reached Heathrow. I understand they were following their rules but my problem was it was inconsistent. If it was business class, it was accepted but not accepted for economy.

### "airline is one of the worst"
Kathmandu to Delhi return. I have traveled with Jet Airways several times and found this airline is one of the worst. I have complained about their service but they are trying to defend their mistake instead of acknowledging their mistakes

### "become very complacent"
Probably rate it as a 1 star. Staff attitude very bad on ground and inflight from London - Mumbai - Bhuj - Mumbai and London. Food atrocious, seats very cramped and un-comfortable. Emailed customer services and had a very poor response after 2 weeks. Cabin crew pretending to be busy when requesting for service, making excuses "i will be there in a moment" by which then I had nearly completed my 7 hour journey. In-flight headphones not working and when they did it crackled and poor choice of movies. The seat recliner would stay reclined and I could not sit up. It was like a rocking chair and the passenger behind getting agitated. I have always flown with this airline and was happy till now as they have monopolised this route and passenger service declined. Their training procedures need to be reviewed urgently as they have become very complacent.

### "no pillow, sleep mask, blanket"
Delhi to Doha. Pros cabin staff informative and assistant. Cons - no pillow, sleep mask, blanket, ear phones. Ground stuff at Mumbai did not assist on tight transit domestic flight and give incorrect gate information - no operating seat monitor displays on flight exceeding 4hrs.

### "Experience on board was pathetic"
We flew Jet Airways and were disappointed with both the ground staff as well as onboard crew. Since, we were travelling with a 6 month baby, I had requested a bassinet seat after the tickets were booked. The bassinet was confirmed for Mumbai to Abu Dhabi leg of the trip. A seat was also provided in the front row. However, to be sure we arrived at the airport early for check in. Found that the seat was offered in row 31. I asked the personnel in Kochi and he said the bassinet was there from Mumbai. Found that this was a row in the back. After reaching Mumbai, we spoke to the ground staff there and they said the bassinet was never confirmed and they do not see that I was offered a seat in front row in the past. On showing the ticket copy, she said the information was not in their system. Also, that the flight does not have a facility for bassinet to be placed. On entering the flight, I found that it was a lie to keep me away, since there were provisions for 2 bassinets to be placed. Experience on board was pathetic as well. Seats were uncomfortable, staff was rude. Asked for warm water and never got it. Food was of low quality. Flew with Jet Airways after 4 years and found that the service has only degraded.

### "Appalling service!"
Mumbai to London Heathrow. Appalling service! Firstly, After having confirmed my choice of meal via online checking I was presented with a non veg meal when i'm a vegetarian. There was no organisation as some passengers received their meals up to 20 mins before others. No refreshments were being offered and the hostess was dismissive and very rude. I cannot fathom how they deem such rudeness as customer service. Throughout the flight the hostesses were rarely seen and when I went to the kitchenette area I was ignored as they were busy talking among themselves. Secondly, my headphones did not work and again i was dismissed! I am so disgusted by the experience. Yes a long flight is uncomfortable, noisy due to screaming children throughout the flight, however having to deal with such rudeness and lack of care for not only myself (having witnessed the way other passengers were dealt with) I will not fly with jet airways ever again. Perhaps the air staff should be asked whether they like to 'care' for passengers before they take on this responsibility! I am forced to leave a minimum rating of 1, when I actually mean zero.

### "delayed by more than 3 hours"
We had booked flight with Jet Airways partnered with Delta Air Lines from Detroit to Ahmedabad with inbound flight starting from Detroit on February 2nd and Outbound flight from Ahmedabad on February 18th. When I checked in for Delta flight on the morning of February 2nd, It showed my itinerary from Detroit to London to Mumbai to Ahmedabad where I was able to check in for Delta flight with other flights pending boarding card from London for Jet airways. At that time, I called Jet airways and booked seats 31 G, H, J & K for London to Mumbai flight as you allow us to book it 24 hours before flight takes off. When I went to Detroit Airport, the staff at delta told me that my final destination is Vadodara. I was neither informed nor I did get any notification of the change. So I told them to hold off and got on phone with Jet airways customer support line. I spent next hour and half without any result or reprieve. I wanted a confirmation that Jet will provide me transportation services from Vadodara to Ahmedabad at no charge since I have no relatives who live in Vadodara. I did not get any answer. Finally when Delta employees told me that if I don't check in, I will lose my entire flight, I had no option button check in. When I reached London, there was no one at Jet Airways desk for about 45 minutes after we landed. They confirmed with me that transportation service will be provided from Vadodara to Ahmedabad. But when they gave me boarding passes, my seats were changed from 31 to 57 D, E, F and G. Since my kids are 5 and 8, I always prefer atleast one window seat and that is what I had booked on the day of the journey originally. Then in London, our flight got delayed by more than 3 hours. We were scheduled to Depart at 3:55 London time. We did not leave London until 6:45. We were told that due to one runway being closed at Mumbai airport, this problem have happened. We can request compensation from the airline if flight gets delayed by more than 2 hours. Since flight was overbooked, I heard someone say that if anyone ask for compensation, delay them and then bump them off so we can accommodate people. That is why we did not even try that. I had told the lady at the counter that since we are delayed more than expected, I will have barely an hour to get through Immigration and customs so I may miss my flight to Vadodara. She told me that is more than enough time to do that and make my connecting flight. We asked her to at least request the crew to allow us to disembark ahead of other people who did not have any connections so we can make through immigration and customs to take care of our connecting flight. She did not do that. Neither did any of the crew member listened to us for the same reason too. By the time we reached gate, we had 55 minutes before our flight departed. Immigration and customs took around 1hour and 40 minutes which meant, we had missed second connection as well. So, when we reached the window for transfer flights, the supervisor was overwhelmed as there were about 47 people like us. After about arguing and yelling and screaming, we did get 4 tickets on flight to Ahmedabad.

### Jet Airways customer review
I live in Hong Kong and the regulations for the airport are that the check-in counters close 60 minutes before departure (in fact most of the decent airlines would wait until at least 40 minutes as all the procedures in HK are very swift and it literally takes 10-12 minutes to pass through all the inspections including immigration). I arrived 65 minutes before my flight (and so did at least 2 other passengers). No sign of anyone whatsoever. So they not only were packing their things or leaving, they had already left. Outrageous. So I asked the local services together with other passengers who were 'late' (in fact we weren't) to call them and come back, but they said they wouldn't. I'm just buying another ticket for my trip because I will never deal with Jet Airways again. I have never ever had such a situation in any part of the world, and I've travelled to at least 40-50 countries.

### "Highly unappreciable behaviour"
I flew Jet Airways on the 10th Feb from Delhi to Dubai. When I reached airport to check-in at the Jet Airways counter I waited in line for my turn for 30 minutes, then they told me that the queue was for domestic travel passengers, although no where was it mentioned. Then when I boarded the flight, my seat number was 30 which falls in the middle of the flight. When they started serving food and reached my seat, their vegetarian food was finished and I was left with only chicken biryani. When we asked for vegetarian, they compensated it with a salad instead of food. Highly unappreciable behavior.

### "Very disappointed with Jet Airways"
Mumbai to Kochi. First when we got to Mumbai Airport we lined up and then we were told to go to the other line, we stayed in that line for 20 minutes and then we were told this is not the right line. I was very upset why Jet Airways staff doesn't have any clue where should Customer line up. Today we are returning back to Mumbai and we checked online and it says the flight is on Schedule and we got to the Airport and now it says the flight is delayed by 2 hours. Very disappointed with Jet Airways.

### "flight stewards were unpleasant"
Flew Jet Airways from Kochi to Doha. I had my flight on February 1st 2018. At the time of check-in the staff requested for to me to cancel the trip as the flight was overbooked. I felt so unwelcomed. She offered me a compensatiion. Later there was a change in boarding gate and the flight was so congested. The seats were too old and the flight stewards were unpleasant. I was seated in the last row so I could hear their conversation. They were continously speaking badly about the passengers who asked them for a particular service. Crew had no smile on their face. Really the worst experience.

### "did not disappoint this time"
This is one of the most convenient routes for Indians travelling from Calicut to Dammam Saudi Arabia. With no stopovers, Jet Airways does a fantastic job of getting you there on time, even before scheduled time. They did not disappoint this time either with the flight taking off on time and landing half an hour early. I do have a few complaints though. The seats are super uncomfortable for larger people and the belt, even after increasing the length is a bit tight. The food was ok and came as requested. Jet Airways conducted another security inspection before boarding the plane, which made no sense since it had never happened before and we had already been through security check at the airport. The Entertainment system is really poor since they have no screens and we have to sign in on their Wifi and connect to their site to watch entertainment channels. It does not work for the iPhone sadly!

### "my experience was a pleasant surprise"
Flew Hong Kong to Mumbai. Having read the reviews, I was expecting the worst and wondered why Qantas would codeshare with an airline everyone seemed to hate. But my experience was a pleasant surprise. The flight was on time, the crew were helpful and welcoming - nothing seemed to be too much trouble, which is not the case with Qantas these days! The food was above average and the crew regularly checked the toilets and were clean and dry. Seats comfortable, the entertainment choices were fine, although they didn't include many current release movies. I'd be happy to fly Jet Airways again. Both it and IndiGo leave Air India far behind.

### "attitude was by far the worst"
London to Chennai via Mumbai. While the onward journey was smooth without any hassles except that the fact they told my luggage would be through checked-in to Chennai which is not the case and after clearing the customs & immigration at Mumbai and standing in the check-in line for more than a hour for my connecting domestic leg towards Chennai I found out that I need to collect and check in my baggage again. So I had to do everything all over again and to top it off their ground staff pointed me towards a wrong boarding gate as well. I found out the confusion at the last minute and later found the correct one with a few minutes to spare ! There's nothing special to write about their in-flight service except the fact that their seats are hard like wood (but its clean at least) and in-flight meals were okay and to my surprise they do not even serve beer in their international flights. But my return journey to Canada was even more horrendous. I got a message in the eve of my journey that my flight to Mumbai would be delayed by an hour. Arrived at the airport 3 hrs prior to the actual departure and inquired their staff during check-in whether I will be able to make it to my connecting flight at Mumbai towards London and they assured that I will. I even asked them to accommodate me in the earlier flight at 9 PM which was supposed to leave in an hour to Mumbai at that point, which they politely refused. Flight departed at 11PM (one hour later than scheduled) but landed at 1:10 AM more than 1 hr later than scheduled arrival at Mumbai due to runway closure. At that point I knew I'd not be able to board the 9W120 to London, but again their staff assured it will wait. As I was about to clear the immigration at around 2:10 AM, they pulled me out and told me that I can no longer board the flight to London which was on-time. They then made me wait for 40 mins before taking me to the Jet airways counter in T2. Most of their support staffs at the counter were pathetic, unapologetic, arrogant and made me wait for close to 4 hrs before booking me in the same flight next day and they wouldn't even give an accommodation for that day and I was stranded in Mumbai airport for 24 hrs. What bothered me was the attitude of the staff who was simply rude and was not at all bothered to attend us and simply vanished from the counter for close to 2hrs. That hurt me more than the flight delay and the long wait. I had to spend my own hard earned money and had to miss a lot meetings and of course a vacation day just to pay for their screw up. This was not the first delay I ever come across during my trips abroad, but the staff's attitude was by far the worst I have ever come across in the world. I'm pretty sure it would be mine & my family's last trip with Jet airways. I'd not even consider them for domestic travel too. Hope they do not take the customer's for granted in the coming days !

### "lack of communication"
My family and I booked our flights with Etihad airlines to travel from Melbourne to India return in January 2018. Etihad has code sharing arrangements with Jet Airways and our return flight on 19 January was from Mumbai to Kochi to Abu Dhabi to Melbourne. Our first flight from Mumbai to Kochi did not take off for 2 hours! There was absolutely no communication as to the reason for the delay! As we had a connecting flight to Abu Dhabi I got up and walked upto the flight attendants who were seated at the back but I was asked to go back and take a seat. The plane was warm with no air conditioning and passengers could not get up and use the toilet and no one knew why the plane was not taking off. Finally, the flight took off after more than 2 hours and the pilot announced very briefly and very casually that he was not getting clearance from ground traffic control so he could not take off and as he was so busy communicating with traffic control he could not communicate with the passengers! As a result of this delay we missed our connecting flight to Abu Dhabi. Jet Airways at Kochi informed us that we would be put on the next flight to Abu Dhabi and our flight from Abu Dhabi to Melbourne would be the next morning. We asked if we would be provided with accommodation as we had missed the flight for no fault of ours. But Jet Airways informed us that they could not provide accommodation as the delay was due to traffic control and not due to technical fault. We were quite aghast! We asked that there reason not to provide us accommodation be put in writing. This they refused! We insisted that we want a letter stating that they could not give us accommodation due to the reasons of traffic control or we would not board the next flight. Due to our stance a supervisor came and said that as a special case they have arranged for us to use the Etihad lounge at Abu Dhabi until 7.30 in the morning and they also provided us with refreshments at Kochi. All this was possible only because of our insistence as a group of three. I am appalled at Jet Airways lack of communication on the flight and the devious methods adopted in order to avoid giving us accommodation for missing the flight due to no fault of ours.

### "had to pay £125 cancellation fee"
London to Hong Kong via Mumbai. They invoice you in £ but they actually charge your card in a different currency. Hence your final fare is higher than what you were invoice and your credit card will fine you a currency conversion fee. I had to cancel my flight and had to pay £125 cancellation fee (in their invoice). But again, they refunded me in a different currency and hence they've actually charged me more than £125 in cancellation fees! I've contacted them twice, each time taking 10 days for them to respond and they never sorted out my issue.

### "crews are helpful"
Jodhpur to Bengaluru. Jet Airways provide hot food which is complimentary with the ticket. Their Inflight entertainment provides real-time flight position with speed. Also contains a good collection of music and movies. Flight is clean and crews are helpful. In my route: Jodhpur to Mumbai, Bengaluru, Flight normally get delayed by 20-30 minutes.

### "boarding process poorly handled"
Goa to Bombay in Business Class. The flight provided good service and comfortable seats for a 45 mins flight. However, the boarding process in Goa was poorly handled. There was no proper boarding announcement for Club Premiere passengers, nor was the gate staff aware that we have priority in boarding. We pay a premium for some of these added perks and to see the Jet Airways staff bungle it is disappointing.

### "Worst flight ever"
Toronto to Delhi via Amsterdam. Worst flight ever. I’ll never and ever travel in this flight again. Rude staff, bad service. As soon as I boarded the flight, the air hostesses told me that there is no space for the handbag inside the cabin. They placed my handbag inside the cargo space I think. When I tried to figure out why this all is happening, then one of their employee there said that you are lucky enough to have a seat. I was like since when did the flights started carrying passengers while standing. Literally I had to carry all the stuff by myself without a bag. It was such a horrible experience. Moreover, it is been more than 6 days that I have lodged the complaint but no outcome yet. Whenever I’m calling customer service and asking about any updates about my bag they say “we don’t know where your bag is yet give us 24 hours more to find” and I am like how many 24 hours you guys need to find one bag at Toronto airport.

### "never book Jet Airways again"
Trivandrum to Goa via Mumbai.There was a small typo in the last name of the passenger (Instead of o - it was u mentioned). After realizing the mistake we called up the airline for helping us out. But they didn't provide any help other than forcing us to cancel and rebook the ticket which costed us 350 dollar extra. Team doesn't value the money of customers and take advantage of the situation to make them book the same flight for double the amount. Would never book Jet Airways again.

### "rudeness and unprofessionalism"
Horrible experience. I had recently travelled with jet from London to Ahmedabad via Mumbai and back and had a pretty bad experience. The flight crew was extremely unwelcoming and rude. Any call for a cabin crew member on the flight asking for a landing card or water, was met with extreme rudeness and unprofessionalism. The food quality on the flight has gone down as well. The flight delays were not handled well and so many eledery passengers on the flight were harassed because of this at Mumbai airport. The airport staff was also extremely unprofessional and unhelpful and unaccommodating. My sister too took a flight from NYC to Ahmedabad and back and was harassed at the Mumbai airport after the long flight she had just taken from NYC. She was unfairly charge for her excess luggage, she was told by the Jet staff that her card had been declined twice when in fact she was charged twice on the card and then she had to run around the airport looking for an atm to withdraw cash. Jet Airways was once known for providing excellent in flight experience - with welcoming and hospitable staff, good food, and helpful airport staff but now has rude and unprofessional cabin crew and airport staff that perfom their jobs out of routine and boredom and do not provide the Jet experience. I will not ever be travelling with Jet again. Please learn something from other airlines like Singapore Airlines or Emirates, at least their staff is not unwelcoming and inhospitable.

### "unhelpful staff"
Delhi to Jodhpur. Unreliable airline, unhelpful staff and confusing pre flight information made me miss my flight after check in and passport control procedures were done on time. The airline was changing departure time several times before the departure date and during the departure day.

### "service is not organised"
I had very very bad experience travelling with Jet Airways Delhi to Riyadh. As the boarding started they called my name and said my luggage was stopped and I have to remove something from it. After I got luggage clearance I ran back to the gate. I finally made it to the plane. The crew service is not organised at all. You have to request them to serve you your food. They serve people randomly around you for some odd reason. They don't bother to show up when you press the light.

### "it wasn't a good experience"
My family and I used Jet Airways to fly round trip from Toronto to Amsterdam. We choose them because of the price, but even considering that, it wasn't a good experience. The planet itself needed some upgrades and serious cleaning, the service was careless, horrible food, entertainment was ok if you like Bollywood movies. On the way back our luggage didn't make on time and it was delivered later. Three out of four bags were damaged. After multiple phone calls, I finally was directed to the right person. I was asked to send pictures. Over two weeks I was asked to send them again (they couldn't locate them). After two months of leaving unanswered messages and emails, I gave up. We were not refunded or even apologized to for the loss.

### "not fly with Jet Airways again"
Delhi to Dehradun return . I flew twice with Jet Airways, on my flight to Dehradun, the flight I booked was cancelled and I had to write Customer Service and rebook, as they put me on an earlier flight which would not have been able to get. On my flight back, they were 3 hours late taking off. All the Jet Airways flights that day were late and they were the only airline that was true for. Service was ok, not particularly friendly, looked like the Cabin Crew was having a real bad day. I would not fly with Jet Airways again.

### "steer clear of such airlines"
London to Mumbai via Delhi. On the flight from Delhi to Mumbai they damaged my new bag. Upon meeting with the baggage services team at the airport, they refused to issue me with a Property Irregularity report - which is my right as a customer. Instead, the employee started harassing me saying that this is not worth his time and he cannot give a PIR for such cases. I said this is appalling behaviour and not how I expect Jet to treat customers. He then raised his tone and started saying that he is going to close the case immediately. It was only later when his superior intervened that they took my details and gave me an email address to correspond with. I send my entire case details to the baggage services email address and kept chasing - even after 2 weeks - they have not bothered to give any support. The problem seems to be with the culture of the employees who take customers for granted and don't want to offer them any service. Travellers should steer clear of such airlines.

### "had the worst experience with them"
London to Ahmedabad via Mumbai. When I was getting off my Delta flight I saw my luggage being unloaded in perfect condition. Then had to transfer to jet airways to fly to Mumbai and then to Ahmedabad. On my way to Mumbai all the passengers around me were served their lunch but me and my brother. I turned the call light on but there was no response by the air hostesses for approximately 40-50 mins. After I call out to air hostesses when she is passing by regarding my lunch she tells me that she will be getting it soon. That soon didn’t happen till next 30 minutes. Then after I asked for more snack it took her an hour to bring me the plate and by that time my hunger was gone. In all I would say the service in plane was so awful. Then when we get to the Mumbai airport our luggage didn’t make it so had to file complaint about it. They said That the luggage would be home by the evening I landed or might be the next morning. So when I didn’t get my bags in the promised time I had to go shop for clothes which was totally unexpected expence I had to make because the airlines could hold up thier end of the promise. Then I had to make plenty of phone calls to locate my bags and the only thing Jet Airways would tell me was that they couldn’t locate my luggage. Every time I called the customer service it took them about 40-50 minuets just to get on the line and have someone in-person to talk to. Then my father and my brother went to the airport when I didn’t get my bags for 3 days after not knowing where the luggage was. They talked to the manger after arguing with the staff. Finally they got my bags and they were in awful condition. 2 out of 4 bags were torn. I was so upset to see my bags torn and I went off on the agent who worked with Jet Airways. So after they said to file a case with customer service about it I said that they didn’t respond to me regarding that before when I filed for compensation for not having any clothing. They say that they will revert back within 24 hours which is false information. So then we leave with our luggage. People don’t  fly by Jet Airways. Be ready to be treated the same was I was. They are really awful. I had the worst experience with them.

### "service has drastically deteriorated"
Dubai to Goa via Mumbai. Never again - deteriorating service! Flown Jet in the past on both domestic and international routes but service has drastically deteriorated. Three of our 4 flights were delayed. Because of our Dubai - Mumbai delay we've missed our Mumbai - Goa flight. Arrived Mumbai at 5:00 am yet check-in refused us to board our 5:30 am flight resulting in a 11 hour layover. No apologies, no free lounge access from an extremely arrogant manager whom offered us a "take it or leave it" breakfast at Punjab restaurant consisting of 3 slices of toast + 3 coffee or tea in small paper cups for the 3 of us. No cheese/ jam - nothing. Needless to say we've left and bought something decent elsewhere. A whole day wasted which was a bad start to our long deserved annual vacation. Will in future rather book with a decent airline instead of gambling with this budget airline - not worth the risk unless one is desperate. Moreover, interior of plane from Mumbai to Goa almost fell apart. Concerning how aviation authorities would grant Jet Airways a licence as most passengers chairs were dysfunctional as our friend's seat did not have a seat-belt and witnessed quite a few passengers fiddling with their chairs that keep reclining.

### "such a horrid experience"
Kolkata to Jorhat. Major issues with this flight. Upselling at KOL airport to business class was done aggressively and we were left feeling ripped off and almost missed our flight as the Jet airways rep took 2 hours to upgrade us - he later admitted he had lost our economy seats and struggled to get business seats - lesson - do not upsell seats if you do not have them. We also were not sitting together despite this being a prerequisite for us upgrading. Secret stops - should be notified to the customer - we were given the wrong gate number, the flight on the screen had a different destination to Jorhat and we had to ask about 10 people before another customer explained that the flight stops at another destination first and we needed to look for that destination on the screen at KOL - Note this was not information given to us by anyone  at Jet airways. Not being told what do to when landing at stopover - we almost got off the flight thinking we were at our destination - staff did not tell us what to do. This happened on the way back too - but even worse there was another stop over which we had no idea about and cabin staff gave us the wrong advice, telling us to stay on the plane and then telling us to get off 40 mins later - meaning we would miss our connection. The bus that picked us up from the plane did not know where do take us and we ended up going through security again (running) with 20 other PAX. If the flight hadn't been delayed we would have missed it due to your error. Note also that staff in KOL were unhelpful, unapologetic about the error and gave no information about the correct gate and time. Indeed they simply walked off and pretended to be on phone calls rather than help the 20+ PAX from our flight who were panicking. We will never ever use Jet again, such a horrid experience which tainted our trip to and around India!!! To add insult to injury we also had a flight from DEL back to LHR with Jet which was just as bad, my partner's tray table was broken, there was dried vomit on the floor and we had to help older infirm passengers to the toilet and back as the cabin staff could not be bothered!

### "poor in every aspect"
London to Delhi. Jet Airways are poor in every aspect. Check in, 0/10. Queues at Heathrow and Delhi were extremely long even for a simple bag drop. On time performance, 2/10. Flight delayed in Delhi by 4 hours due to a technical fault. Boarding experience, 0/10. Boarding should be by seat row numbers but everyone just rushed to jump on and the ground staff had no control over the process. In flight dining, 1/10. A muffin for breakfast after an 8 hour flight. Crew who disappear after the meal service and don't even bother to serve water. The coffee and wine were as bad as the food. Seats, 0/10. Rock hard seats with average recline and no foot rest. Terrible. In flight experience, 0/10. No USB charging cables. Poor in-flight entertainment. Jet Airways appear to be disinterested in this product as there is zero care for passengers at all either on the ground or in the air. Genuinely one to avoid. They are cheap for a reason but I will not be flying with them again.

### "worst flight I have ever taken"
Bangalore to Toronto via Amsterdam. Flight from BLR to AMS : This flight was decent, cabin not too full, hence crew could give you water etc. The food was bad. Also that seats were very tough for an 11 hour (almost) flight. Was seated in 14k Flight from AMS to YYZ: This has to rank as the worst flight I have ever taken. The seats were so hard that you could not sit properly for 15 mins without fidgeting. The flight was full, so my hand baggage also when to check in, after I removed every possible electrical thing, like a bluetooth speaker and even a laptop. I still did not have space to keep my bag. Then came the crew who were slow, All I wanted was some lukewarm water, but they literally made me beg for it. It came with a lag of atleast 15-20 mins. Lets not talk about the food, horrible again. Was seated on 32k

### "never travel with Jet Airways in future"
We took a connecting flight from Delhi to Colombo via Mumbai, the first flight was delayed from Delhi and we missed Colombo flight from Mumbai. That's all right but Jet Airways staff was totally non co operating. They were not bothered about the harassment of travelers... No hotel was arranged no food was arranged. With lot of requests they arranged tickets for Colombo after 15 hours and faced lot of difficulties. We will never travel with Jet Airways in future.

### "not have any space to stretch your leg"
Mumbai to Trivandrum. I flew Jet Airways for the first time, and I have mixed feelings about the whole experience. I tried to checkin online 24 hours before my flight time. But the website seem to not working as I wanted. All the window seats and aisle seats were marked paying seats. It was like forcing the economy passengers to pay for all the window and aisle seats. Anyway I didn't care and booked a seat. Reaching Mumbai from Brussels, I have to reclaim my check in baggage to any Jet Airways counter. At the counter I requested the lady agent to change my seat to another aisle seat as I thought it was too close to the washrooms. She told me "Sir you are actually at a good seat"! So, I agreed and let it be. In the aircraft, I found that my seat was next to the barrier of business class, and did not have any space to stretch your legs. However the crew were courteous and helpful. Food was good and drink service enough. The flight took off in time accurately.

### "callous and ignorant behavior"
I was booked to travel from New Delhi to Bhopal on 8th Dec 2017. The departure time for the aircraft was 5:45 am. I reached the airport at 4:50 am and headed for the check-in counter which had a long queue. I checked with the supervisor having in mind that I might be just on time, but she simply directed me to the queue. While in queue when the time was 5:05am I inquired with one of the staff standing aside whether I was getting late for my check-in, he simply told me that I was well in time and that flight announcement will be made in case the time left is less. By the time I reached the counter, it was 5:15am and I wasn't allowed to board. Despite all requests and pleads, I was shown no consideration and I missed my flight. Moreover, when I had to exit the airport, they took almost half an hour to guide me out of the airport premises. This incident calls for an introspection into the non-cordial, non-supportive, callous and ignorant behavior of the airport staff of this airline who could have guided me on time to prevent me from missing my flight. It should be their endeavor to have a more concerned and empathetic attitude to accommodate and assist as many passengers as possible for a smooth journey rather than merely shoving them off despite queries and concern from the passengers' side.

### "refund was not processed"
New Delhi to Singapore on Nov 24, 2017. While in queue for check-in, I was offered an upgrade by the Duty Manager to business class for $364. She assured me that the aircraft was a Boeing 777 with lie-flat seats in Business. I accepted. At the gate, I saw that the plane was an old 737 with seats that barely reclined. I asked the gate agent to call the Duty manager and reverse my purchase. At first she declined. But after I told her that she had essentially sold me something that could not be delivered, she agreed. The manager met with me with the  cashier who had initially processed the charge who promptly processed a refund. On returning home, I saw that the refund was not processed (as of 12/5/2017). Repeated emails to Jet Airways have gone unanswered.

### "didn't feel like a premium airline"
Kolkata to Delhi. Jet Airways was my favorite airline for more than a decade. Now, I have no desire left to still keep Jet as my preferred airline. I purchased Jet Airways ticket in the United States in September, 2017. Their baggage policy on the Jet Airways stated "For Tickets issued in the United States of America and Canada, the free baggage allowance for standalone journey within India in Economy is 23 kgs. This policy seemed very thoughtful of Jet because all international travels allow suitcases of 23 Kgs. Knowing that I would be carrying two suitcases of 23 Kgs each, along with the one way ticket from Kolkata to Delhi for INR 2,607, I also purchases prepaid option for 25 Kgs of excess baggage for almost three times the ticket price itself for INR 7,125. At the airport, they insisted that baggage allowance is only 15 kgs despite showing them a printout of their own website which clearly stated 23 kgs for U.S. based tickets. They charged me additional INR 2100 for 6 Kgs at INR 350 per Kg. I wasn't happy about it. I ended up paying about 3.5 times the ticket fare for excess baggage. My international ticket allowed this baggage as part of their luggage allowance. I consider Jet Airways as not a good fit for USA residents because only 7 kg carry on baggage allowance and no personal items and only 15 Kgs of checked in allowance. Too little for International travelers. I paid close to additional USD $150 for baggage. It can completely stress someone out if travelling on a budget. The Manager on duty seemed powerless to take care of the luggage situation despite showing him Jet's policy. He recommended that I talk to customer relations for further assistance. Jet didn't feel like a premium airline, it used to operate like a few years ago. I hope that the time I spent writing my assessment of the Jet Airways service will help many to plan their itinerary better and help Jet to make an effort to listen their customers.

### "it was a pleasant experience"
Bombay to Goa in Club Premiere which is Jet Airways' version of Business Class. Overall it was a pleasant experience for this short flight which departed one hour late. The service and food served were of a good standard. In this day and age, it is strange that Jet Airways does not provide WiFi on domestic flights.

### "bad experience with delayed luggage"
Paris to Mumbai. I had a bad experience with delayed luggage during my flight which finally took 4 days to be delivered to Goa. Already in Paris I  asked staff before boarding if my bag is there and I got a confirmation that I don t have to worry and my bag is in the plane. Company is so bad with communication. All 4 days they told me different information where my bag is and they kept changing info about the delivery date. Finally bag arrived with few broken things. Wouldn't use their service anymore.

### "Service good for one hour flight"
Rajkot to Mumbai. Delayed flight but due to airport and not the airlines fault. The check-in was a bit interesting - they don't check amount and size of handlugge, but have a strict 15k on the suitcase, which causes the boarding to take a long time time due to a lot of carryon. Staff very friendly. Service good for a one hour flight.

### "fee for paying with credit/debit card"
Delhi to Hong Kong. Jet Airways is perhaps the only Indian airline that charges a fee (more than $20) for paying with a credit/debit card (they call it convenience fee), and also charges a fee for seat selection (more than $20). Their website informs a passenger that they charge a fee for seat selection when their online check in opens 48 hours before a given flight departure, but, they make it free 12 hours before the flight departure. However, when I attempted to check in online 9 hours before my flight departure, they were still selling the seat selection. They kind of force a passenger to pay for seat selection, because, without a paid seat selection, one cannot proceed further to check in online. This, apart from the fact that their website is rotten. The so-called convenience fee is grating because it imposes a double penalty on a passenger. They seem to forget that when one buys a ticket online, Jet Airways save their staff time, which saves them enormous amount of money, which more than compensates for their 3% cost of credit/debit card transactions. I have used Jet Airways internationally in business class and domestically within India in economy class, but always found their ground check in counters crowded. There does not seem to be any degree of efficiency in checking in their passengers.

### "It was a great experience"
Mumbai to Jaipur. It was a great experience for me to fly with Jet airways. The journey was very comfortable though flight was delayed ofr 45mins but i guess it was ok because I understand it was not the airlines fault. And also the cabin crew were very courteous and a staff helped me to put my bag as there was no space to keep my bag with me below my seat. Overall it was a nice experience.

### "comfortable but needs upgrading"
Mumbai to Singapore with Jet Airways. The flight was comfortable but needs upgrading. There were no charging options for your phones or tablets. Also, the pillows were small and the cabin very cold. Quality of entertainment could have been better. Guess they need to take a leaf or two out of Emirates, Singapore Airlines etc.

### "customer service is a joke"
Delhi to Ahmedabad on 16th November 2017. I had boarding pass from Abu Dhabi through Etihad. I had to collect my baggage from Delhi and had to hand over at Jet's counter at Delhi airport. While I was standing in the queue from 9.15pm onwards and there were passengers cut through line for boarding and staff did not bother to stop anyone. Service level was absolute zero. After that phase, I successfully reached to the counter to hand over my baggage which was labeled all the way through to AMD. Then to figure that out staff took nearly 20 minutes and then printed new stickers. While she was handling all these, I informed staff that I have duty free liqueur with me and she confirmed that it is duty free, yeah? I confirmed "Yes" it is duty free which I have purchased from Delhi airport itself. She advised that as long as it's duty free, no issues. Hence why I did not let it go into the baggage and carried that with me. At security check in, I have been advised to put it through baggage. I went to Jet counter and staff was so rude and arrogant and she has got no sense how to speak to customers! Manager took nearly 25 minutes to come to the counter again and upon her arrival, she was even more rude. Then she asked me to pay Rs.1750 which I agreed to pay, while I handed over my credit card, she said I will have to confirm with someone exact charges which took another 10-15 minutes. After that I have been asked to pay Rs.9700. There was no courtesy throughout and customer service is a joke for them.

### "airline is delayed again"
Jet Airways is even worse than the low cost Indian airlines. I flew from Delhi to Udaipur and back in September 2017 and the flights were delayed both ways. Today I'm flying to Bangkok and this airline is delayed again. I will not fly or recommend this airline to anyone. Food is also pathetic.

### "I wouldn't recommend Jet Airways"
Bangalore to Singapore, it was rather a dissatisfied experience right from the time of booking the ticket. Jet Airways website is so slow, system was not allowing me to do an online check-in, it was getting struck at selecting the seats in the partner airline as Jet Airways don't fly directly to Jakarta. Despite several attempts and even calling their customer care couldn't help me doing the check-in and I ended-up in the lengthy queue at the airport. Their aircraft are pretty old, not so comfortable seating. The in-flight entertainment system got restarted thrice during the journey and was never stable. The choice of movies / content was very poor. Their crew was not so friendly but rather i would say rude, they won't even smile back. The food was not warm and it wasn't nice. I wouldn't recommend Jet Airways anymore, it is not the same airline what it used to be.

### "will never fly this airline again"
Bangkok to Goa via Mumbai. Worst airline ever. The agents in Mumbai are arrogant and worthless. Paid for "Premier" but was assigned "Economy" on one leg of the flight although Premier seats were available. Staff at Goa and Mumbai were unable to resolve inconsistency. The organization at the check in counters is abysmal. The airline web check in procedures is a joke since Indian airport security does not accept electronic boarding passes. The airlines ability to resolve disputes is meaningless since staff appear not to have the authority to resolve anything. They can't even organize a queue. I will never fly this airline again.

### "nothing to complain about"
Bagdogra to Delhi. Staff are nice, friendly. Quality of the food seemed downgraded a little. It's generally better than other airlines. Took long time to get the luggage after arriving in Delhi. Will give a benefit of doubt as this never occurred before. I'm also a Jet Privilege member. They have the simplest system to redeem and accumulating points. I wish they improve their website. Certain cases it is below standard. Overall, an experience that has nothing to complain about.

### "travel experience is horrible"
When we travelled from Raleigh to Chennai we were allowed 2 check in baggages per person. But on our return flight on November 2nd Chennai to Mumbai and Mumbai to Paris and Paris to Raleigh, Jet Airways would only allow one baggage per person. We spoke to CSO customer support and she refused to help us out. And it is so difficult and stressful for customers to repack and reduce the luggage to one baggage per person and wait for our relatives to come back and collect the excess baggage and take it back home. Jet Airways will not reconsider their decision of allowing two baggage owing to bad weather condition or flight delays. They are just not customer friendly and very rude. While we were repacking in the airport every single person were sympathizing with us and feeling sorry. We showed our onward journey ticket that we did carry two baggage on international flight, but the customer staff would not listen. Please do not take jet Airways during any transfer or partner airlines during your international travel. They have the worst service. Also from Paris to Mumbai on October 16 they boarded all the passengers and did not on the air conditioning and over and above that they announce the flight is delayed. When requested to on the air conditioning we were told once the flight moves the air conditioning will be turned on automatically. Same thing happened on October 16 Mumbai to Chennai flight and two babies were crying unstoppable as there was no air. When they know the flight is delayed why do jet Airways board the passengers and then announce the flight is delayed. With no air conditioning it affects our health. The travel experience with Jet Airways is horrible and not worth the price

### "Overall a very poor experience "
Delhi to Toronto. You have to try at least 4-5 times for online web check in. This time I could not check in online as they had some IT issues. When I reached airport around 3 hours early, they told me that flight is overbooked and they don't have anything for me and after that they made me wait for an hour to look for a substitute flight. Finally, they told me that I would go by same flight and I had to rush for my Immigration and security clearance. I almost missed my flight just because of their irresponsible management. Once I boarded the flight, they didn't have the non veg meal which I ordered in advance. Overall a very poor experience and would never want to fly with them again.

### "Staff are rude and unresponsive"
Flew Delhi to Kathmandu. Terrible chaotic check in with no signs showing domestic and international queues at the same checking area so tonnes of people lining up in wrong line. Bag was 3.9 kg over, the check in guy said it would be 400 per kg so I say ok, then you have to go to another office and pay. The check in process is a prelude to the flight. I've flown many times with Jet Airways because I go between Ladakh and Nepal a lot and this airline is very poor. Staff are rude and unresponsive and don't want to bother with anything.

### "disappointment me"
Jet Airways rescheduled the flight from Toronto to Delhi via Amsterdam one day earlier and no other option was given like refund or any compensation. Another issue is that we had requested non veg food and two times meal was served vegetarian saying they do not have non veg available. Not good service given by Jet on this trip -it disappointment me.

### Jet Airways customer review
Kuwait to Mumbai. I was looking forward to fly their A330 product ever since it was introduced on this route early this year. I hate their Boeing 737's across both classes - cramped, tired and boring! Check-in & Boarding was effortless. Welcome drink and warm nuts served. Food was good although not very interesting. The A330-200 seating was extremely comfortable; IFE was okay for a short-haul flight. FAs were extremely courteous and attentive. Deplaning was swift with baggage arriving in first few minutes. The A330  and FAs made this flight very special.

### "Aircraft was very old"
Delhi to Kathmandu. Coming from Amsterdam having 3.30h. transfer time. There was nobody from Jet Airways at the transfer desk, we needed a new boarding pass because they didn't accept the one we got in Amsterdam. After several calls from Air India who could not help us, ground service came after 2 hours, no sorry, nothing. Aircraft was very old, seat comfort awful.

### "crew service was pathetic"
Dubai to Kochi. The cabin crew service was pathetic, i asked for water twice once people got settled down they said that they can bring once we take off, once done i asked again, said that she will bring now but water never came, i just moved on. When they started serving food, the crew had to serve 7 or 8 rows only, unfortunately I was on the last row. I was watching her serving food and drinks to line 1, then she moved to line 2, and then line 3, from there the issues started, line 1-3 guys started asking her for second round of drinks (hot beverages, beer, wine or juices) she started serving them again. Once a passenger notices this, he/she will continue to ask her for re-fillings and the crew kept heeding to their demands, she served three guys thrice before she even reached my row. She even had time to serve 2 guys twice, who happend to sit just ahead of me, before even she gave me my food. All these while i was waiting for her to serve the food. Crew could have just asked the customers to wait for the second round as she has to serve all customers and promise to get back to serve them again. Otherwise service can't be considered as fair, if she had served food for everyone in economy and then get back to those people who had asked for the second round of drinks, then i would have not complained, but this was ridiculous and thus i decided to compain against their service.

### "they provided wrong information"
Hong Kong to Delhi to Pune. I lost my baggage during connecting flight. I registered complaint at Pune Jet airways office for the same and provided all notary documents to clear custom at Delhi airport. After that I have received worst service from Jet Airway staff. I need to keep on calling to customer center for baggage tracking, each time they have provided wrong information and there commitment get failed on progress. After 21 days they had declined that they will transfer the baggage to Pune unless and until I personally visit Delhi airport and clear formality. My baggage has not yet delivered and they had stopped transferring the same, even though the complaint is still open.

### "can't trust their online check-in system"
Really disappointed with Jet Airways online check in service. I was given aisle seats by default which I amended using the online check-in service. I was still given the same old seats in the email confirmation. Due to this, I called up their service desk to explain my situation and they assured me that the seats I selected online are allocated to me and will be given to me at the counter. I was told to ignore the email. Unfortunately at the counter, I was again given the same old seats and was told to show proof about the new seats. I was really disappointed with this service and lost trust in them. I would never fly with them again and can't trust their online check-in system.

### "Really bad experience"
Really bad experience. Flew Premiere Class from Bombay to Chennai. Flight was delayed by 2.5 hours but didn't inform passengers till we got to airport and kept doing a sliding delay. Gate was not shown till 15 minutes prior to departure time just leaving people hanging around and unsure of what's going on. No clear communication. Boarding was a mess. No zones. Just everyone treated like cattle. Huge line and just one boarding line even though there were two counters In Cabin experience was also poor - very old aircraft. Cramped toilet. Dentist style chairs in Business class. No apologies for being late. I was so tired I told them not to wake me up for the meal and they promptly woke me up.

### "food was really disappointing"
Delhi to Dammam. The legroom was pretty comfortable and in-flight entertainment had good choice of movies. The aircraft was a bit old, but well kept. Cabin crew was hospitable, but the food was really disappointing. They definitely need to improve the food quality to international standards. Though overall an average experience, still they need to improve a lot to survive as a people's airline.

### "don't care if families are split"
Mumbai to London. It looks like they are no more interested in customer service. The greed of selling seats is so much that they don't care if families are split, expecting children to travel seated away from parents, surrounded by strangers on the flight. I had to deny boarding, and the next available flight was after 36 hours and Jet Airways didn't bother to compensate at all. I had to book a hotel in Mumbai, for the family, spent on taxis. You have lost my trust, Jet Airways.

### "seat was unremarkable"
Bangkok to Mumbai. From beginning to end there seemed to be something missing. The lounge Jet Airways uses in Bangkok is pretty second rate compared to others in the terminal. Once on board I was welcomed with a glass of water. The seat was unremarkable, particularly for a new plane. It had no power outlets, and the foot rest was broken. The meal was served in the most haphazard manner I have ever experienced. There were only 11 of us in business class. I was the last to be served, though sitting in the 2nd row. In fact, several passengers had finished their meals when I was finally given my table setting and served. I was made to feel that being the only European was the reason I was served last. It was tooo weird. I wish I could say the food was as good as the porcelain it was served on. The service was not bad, but it was just very strange and haphazard. I am not sure I would choose to fly Jet Airways business class again. Inflight entertainment was only available via an app, a fact that was not made clear until it was too late to get the app.

### "Seats decent and legroom ok"
Delhi to Bagdogra, 2 hr flight. Check-in at DEL swift, friendly and efficient. Departure and arrival spot on time. Flight was almost full. Still good service and even a complementary warm meal. Seats decent and legroom ok for a domestic flight. All in all a pleasant experience with Jet Airways.

### Jet Airways customer review
Nagpur to Mumbai with Jet Airways. The check-in was quite easy. While entering the aircraft we were warmly welcomed by the cabin crew. The cabin crew were very polite and listened to the passenger's problem very patiently. The cabin was clean and the legroom was also good. The flight departed and arrived on time. The seats were quite comfortable due to the soft cushioning. The food though wasn't stomach filling it didn't create any issues. Overall a very comfortable flight with Jet Airways.

### "legroom was amazing"
Chandigarh to Mumbai. The check-in was quite easy as compare to other domestic airlines in India. As we entered the flight we were welcomed warmly by the cabin crew. They had a smile on their faces which made us feel comfortable. The cushioning of the seat was quite soft and the legroom was amazing at least for a 6 feet tall guy. The only disappointment was in their food. It was not at all stomach filling and we had no non-veg meal option but it did not create any serious issues. The cabin was quite clean and we had a comfortable flight.

### "I had very bad experiences"
Singapore to Indore via Mumbai. I am a frequent flyer with Jet Airways. Last three trips I had very bad experiences. Their flight is always delayed from 1 to 2 hours. This month I missed my International flight due to the delay in domestic sector. When I approached the customer service counter, they were rude and unapologetic. Told me that they can't do anything and ask me to book another flight. I had to rebook my flight and pay again.

### "there was no entertainment on board"
Flew Jet Airways from Dubai to Delhi. Service on board on this particular flight was really bad. Ticket was expensive and there was no entertainment on board, might be that they have stopped it for cost cutting? Seat on this aircraft was narrow and you couldn't sit properly. Before I use to fly this airline but now no more.

### "Service was excellent"
Goa to Bombay in Club Premiere. Except for the delay in departure and landing, it was a flawless experience. The business class seats are comfortable for short flights although the aircraft was 12 years old and fraying of the seat upholstery was visible. Service was excellent as was the food served.

### "seat covers were worn"
Bangkok to Mumbai. Booked this ticket through Jet Airways Website. I was through with my meetings a day earlier than planned so tried to change the ticket through website and to the surprise it was asking to pay 18,000INR. When contacted at airport the counter staff explained if any change 5,000 as date change fee and 13,000 for fare difference, but as a platinum class JP Member they said can wave 5000 charge. So I travelled as originally programmed. Check in counters were packed, took almost 30 minutes before I could get boarding pass. Lounge is located tooo far from boarding gates and that too a very basic lounge. Aircraft may be 9 to 10 years old, with seat covers were worn and seat reclining mechanism working hardly and other mechanism not functioning. Cabin crew are groomed correct with good service, food was pre booked for Diabetic Non veg. Presentation of food was good. I never felt I had flown Business class.

### "pain of delayed baggage"
Vadodara to Singapore via Mumbai with Jet Airways, connecting in Singapore to Ho Chi Minh City with Jesttar Asia. Counter staff issued Boarding passes to Singapore sectors and barding pass to SGN shall be handed over in Singapore. Mumbai to Singapore flight delayed by one Hour, reached Singapore at 18:40, with only 1 hr 10 min transfer, and enquired Jet staff at gates about connecting flight boarding pass they are not having any clue about it. Rushed to Jetstar Transfer counter got the boarding pass on enquiring about my baggage they are not sure whether the baggage be transferred or not, when I insisted they explained the ticket will get canceled. On reaching Ho-Chi Minh City, as expected the baggage not reached. Baggage dept will not provide any allowance for lost / misplace or delayed baggage, will deliver the bag only within Ho Chi Minh city. Neither Jet airways or Jetstar Customer service put any efforts to reduce the pain of delayed baggage.

### "upgraded to Business"
Delhi to Hyderabad. Got upgraded to Business. Excellent ground service, very smooth check-in and barding process (didn't go to the lounge due to shortage of time). Seat: 1A - spacious, lots of legroom, good cushioning, the upholstery could use a refresh though, a bit worn in patches. Catering was vegetarian option, quite flavourful & filling. Cabin service no problems there, prompt and efficient. Disembarking & Luggage: 2 minute taxi to aerobridge, got a close parking slot, short walk to luggage belt, yet the luggage was waiting when I arrived at the belt. 15 minutes from landing to Arrivals exit!

### "everything was fine"
Kolkata to Mumbai. Boarding was through airbridge and organized zone wise where in passengers for last rows boarded first, and was orderly. Flight departed before scheduled time. A breakfast was served. But the portions were inadequate. Would have been rather okay if they would have charged for the meals. Flight landed ahead of schedule and deplaning was orderly. Overall barring the meal part of flying everything was fine.

### "appalled at quality of food"
Delhi to London Heathrow. Jet Airways staff were friendly but food is a vital part of airline travel. I was appalled at the quality and variety of food and beverages served on my flight from Delhi to London. I usually fly internationally in economy class on other airlines and wasn't prepared to get such low quality food and very limited beverage options. I had a vegetarian plate. Rice was not well cooked, vegetables was totally bland, bread was dry and hard. There was no chutney or pickle. The amount of dessert was so little that the bowl was filled to 1/4 of its capacity - there was no refreshing mint. Snacks include very sad "digestive" biscuits and some plastic salty snack. No fresh fruits or basic chocolates. The veg wrap had a crust from sitting for too long and was barely edible. The passenger next to me ordered the fruit platter. The fruit served smelled awful and I wondered how could my neighbour eat it. She left most of it untouched. It seems that Jet Airways is just checking the box "meal served" without worrying what is put on the plate.

### "Cabin crew were attentive and efficient"
Clean and neat aircraft for less than 2 hrs flight from Mumbai to Chennai. It was a domestic flight within India and a morning flight. Reached flight via airport shuttle bus from the gate since no air bridge was available for this domestic flight. Cabin crew were attentive and efficient throughout the flight. Food service was quick.

### "aircraft very poorly maintained"
The Jet Airways aircraft from Doha to Mumbai was very poorly maintained with all seats torn and extremely dirty. It shows sign of non-maintenance for prolonged time. The leg room for aisle seat was ok and no complaints. The food was flat and plain accompanied with no bread, the quantity was inadequate as well. Being international flight, minimum cleanliness should be maintained but was able to witness dirt that was accumulated over time.

### "unlikely I will fly Jet again"
Mumbai to London Heathrow. This is the sixth time I have flown a return trip to India with Jet. The ticket I had bought allowed me one free change of return date. When I tried to get Jet to change this I was told, for the first time, I would have to get my travel agent in England to do this. When I contacted my travel agent they told me that the fare I had booked was now full and I would have to spend another £195 to fly home in the same seat. I was directed to the small print which made this legal case. Although they were right legally, I wonder how this impacts their customers’ perceptions of value. Yes, I appreciate that there are a range of fares even in economy class, but does earning a few extra Rupees make more business sense than keeping Jet’s word to its customer, and leaving its customers delighted with their service? Another source of grumpiness was that Jet’s computer systems are not capable of supporting a change of return date. I had booked and paid for a window seat (£15), but the frontline staff were not able to give me my window seat for my new date. After several conversations, I was asked to pay again and they would then reimburse me. I used to like Jet because they had some good standards in the past. I was glad to see that boarding was enforced by zones so that the aircraft filled up smoothly from the rear. The entertainment system was good, and so was the food and service on the flight. But Jet has arguably the most uncomfortable seats of any long-distance airline I have flown. The only way to alleviate my discomfort was to use my pillow as extra padding. It is unlikely I will fly Jet again in the future.

### "On-board service was good"
Flew Jet Airways from Lucknow to New Delhi with an onward connecting flight on Lufthansa. The Jet Airways counter at Lucknow will only allow you to check-in at the counter 2 hours before the flight. So, if you arrived at the airport 3 hours prior to departure, you will need to sit and wait. The ground staff applied "International Transfer" tag on my bag and gave me boarding passes all the way till my final destination in LAX. On-board service was good. Even for a short 1 hour flight, Jet Airways gave a vegetarian wrap for snack.

### "Jet is is on a penny-pinching drive"
Not sure what is happening at Jet Airways because they seem to be ignoring their own good standards. I was surprised to find an A330 on this route (Bengaluru to Mumbai) and then saw that it was almost full. What was disappointing that the ground staff did not apply their standard of seating passengers from the rear of the aircraft to help the boarding process. When I asked whay this was so, the person I asked just grinned and made some feeble excuse. We took of on time but had to circle over Mumbai for a long time (>30 minutes), but I don't hold that against the airline. On arriving at the gate, which was an air-bridge, passengers were kept standing for over 20 minutes. I'm not sure if this was because the air-bridge was inoperable or because Jet is is on a penny-pinching drive, judging by their other revenue-squeezing practices, such as wanting Rs 500 to book a seat. Eventually we were told that we would be taken to the terminal by busses, but only after all the passengers had to disembark using just the front steps. The plane was due to leave for Jabalpur, and this could not have helped to keep to their schedules. A far cry from the efficient and customer-focused airline I first encountered back in 2006.

### "Jet Airways has lost its focus"
Has Jet begun a policy or squeezing every last drop of money from its economy customers regardless of the long term effects this might have on loyalty? It claims to be a "full-service" airline but has policies with which Ryanair customers might resonate (and not very well). I have flown Jet to Mumbai six times in the last seven years and this was the first time I had to pay £15 each way to book a seat of my choice. For once, the boarding was to Jet standards and it went well thanks to one very active member of the ground staff who insisted we boarded by zones from the back. The flight was good and we arrived on time. My return trip, which starts tomorrow is another saga which has convinced me that Jet Airways has lost its focus. I cannot blame the front-line staff for all its ills as it is clear that they are not empowered (or trusted?) to do what is right for the customer and the airline. It lacks leadership and there is a sense of drift.

### "staff member was not interested"
London Heathrow - Delhi via Dubai with Jet Airways. Staff at London Heathrow printed my boarding pass through to Dubai and asked me to collect my next boarding pass in Dubai. When I reached Dubai there was a long queue that I had to stand in in order to get boarding pass printed. At the desk, the staff member was not interested in listening as to why I did not have my boarding pass. She started arguing saying it was my job to get my boarding pass printed in  London. She said she did not have time to print my pass and for me to stand aside. I asked her colleague for help who also became rude towards me. The flight from Dubai to Mumbai was awful. Old plane from the 1990s with no comfort. On the way back to London, the passanger in the seat behind me insisted that she want to read a book and that I should keep my seat upright throughout. After 3 hours, I said I need to recline my seat and did so. The angry passanger continued to kick. Anyway to make experience worse the staff served me the wrong food and then they ran out of food.

### "a comfortable night flight"
We flew London Heathrow - Delhi by Jet Airways last month, this is a comfortable night flight. PJs were given, dinner was available but as we had our dinner in the lounge we hit the comfortable flat bed for the night, no mattress provided which is a standard these days. The cabin temperature was comfortable, wash rooms clean but sparsely equipped in C class. The FAs were professional and well turned out. The Delhi - Pune flight was 737-800, which has 12 C class seats in front, adequate leg room and in 2 x 2 config. The FAs were professional but got the lunch order confused, couldn't work out what we wanted, the 2 hours flight was comfortable, and punctual.

### "standards are degrading rapidly"
Mumbai to Guwahati via Kolkata, I again travelled by this airline because of it's timing was suiting me. After using it's toilet I found that there was no soap in dispenser. One of the crew members informed me that the matter was on the books but nobody cared to rectify it. Fortunately, another crew member gave me his personal face wash so that I can wash my hands. My other acquaintances had same kind of experiences with this airline recently. I'm travelling by this airlines since 20 years and I find that their standards are degrading rapidly. One would find better services at lower prices in other airlines.

### "old with no entertainment system"
Kozhikode to Doha. Late night departure, crew was welcoming. On board meal average and the airplane was old with no entertainment system. Toilets was messy through out the flight. Call bells was attended.

### "worst airline I have ever flown"
The worst airline I have ever flown with. Watching the check in of other passengers it was obvious the weight limit for baggage per passenger was breached. Most passengers had a minimum of 3 large hold suitcases and 2 to 3 large cabin cases. Boarding was chaotic, worse than a rugby scrum. As expected there was not enough room for cabin bags and many of these appeared to be up to 15 kilos each. Seats were very uncomfortable, no padding, were narrow and very short. If the passenger in front dropped their seat back you were wearing them in your lap. No instructions to raise seat backs whilst eating. Revolting food. Third world toilets. Rude staff. Not enough fluid offered for hydration. Had to wait 1 hour for baggage on the carousel since too many bags resulted in not enough space on the carousel. Pay more and go with a better airline since the travel to and from our holiday ruined the overall holiday experience.

### "misled by Jet Airways staff"
Toronto to Amsterdam, connecting on El Al to Tel Aviv. The flights were fine, nothing exceptional. The big problem was that our luggage was delayed/lost both on our way to Tel Aviv and back. We checked several times if our luggage would be transferred to the final destination and we were misled by Jet Airways staff. Their customer service line for lost or delayed baggage was unresponsive. Their policies on the matter are also poor. I'll have to wait 21 days to be compensated for any potential damages or total loss.

### "like a bus with too many seats"
Hong Kong to Mumbai. I had a very disappointing experience with Jet airways. I was attempting to upgrade my cabin from Economy to Premiere on my flight from Hong Kong to Mumbai. I made a payment through website using 2 different credit cards (AMEX and VISA). The website took the payment with VISA but reported an error both times when it was trying to generating a confirmation of my payment. I wasn't able to understand if my seat had been upgraded. I called their very unfriendly call center based in Mumbai. I was made to wait for over 30 minutes before i was routed to the right department and still no one was able to help me. I called multiple times and it cost me a lot to have those calls with Mumbai from Hong Kong with not much success. Finally the airport got me the upgrade but i wasn't able to obtain a proper receipt from Jet airways for the upgrade and have been calling and writing to their call center a number of times without any success. With this kind of poor and irresponsible customer service I would want to avoid Jet airways if I can in the future. Despite travelling business class (Premiere) the service in the cabin was poor and I was unable to get the food of my choice as highlighted in their menu card as they said it was finished. I can accept something like this in economy but not in premiere. The premiere cabin looks like a bus with too many seats in a small space making it feel very cramped and not business like where you can get any proper relaxation of comfort. I have traveled with 4 airlines in business in the last 2 months and this has been the worst experience overall. Its time to wake up and do something about this

### "6 flights, only 1 was on-time"
Flew Amsterdam to Delhi via Varanasi. Awful airline (especially for special diets and allergies): Indian customer service at its worst. I booked my whole Indian holiday with Jet Airways: out of 6 flights, only 1 was on-time (international had 5 hours delays while other companies for same destination were all on time). Forget about special diets, they have 2 choices: veg and non-veg. For the rest they’ll apologize a lot but you’ll never get your special on any flights. I traveled for 8 hours on 1 apple and a plate of fruit. Crew promised upgrade as compensation for next flight but it never happened. Staff ignore you, maybe because they don’t speak good English? Ground staff are useless as they can’t help with connecting flights. Neither will partner companies. Toilets are filthy, with pools of liquid on the floor, sinks were flooding. They were not cleaned once throughout the flight. In-flight entertainment is not relevant or old. Vintage movies and 10 year-old TED talks are the best you find. Do yourself a favor, book with any other company.

### "hard-working and motivated cabin crews"
❎ Unverified |  Domestic flights VNS-DEL and DEL-BOM on B738. THE VNS ground staff double checked our luggage allowance due to our Etihad Guest membership (if it's higher than the usual 15 kg), which was very good of them. Were very apologetic to charge us Rs. 500 per person for the luggage. Efficient turnaround and the 20-minute delay from VNS with a tight connection to BOM (9W742 and 9W376, respectively) was handled in an exemplary way by the Jet Airways ground staff at DEL Airport, were eventually the first to board the BOM flight. Both flights full, relatively new aircraft, hard-working and motivated cabin crews, hot snack on the VNS-DEL sector and a full dinner on the DEL-BOM sector. Perfect ground staff at VNS and DEL and perfect cabin crews plus an on time landing at BOM. A 10/10 would be quite appropriate given the good price we got but the tight legroom made the longer flight somewhat uneasy. Will fly Jet Airways again.

### "experience I had was not acceptable"
I flew Jet Airways from Toronto to Kathmandu with two stop transit. The experience I had was not acceptable. On my return I travelled with my friend's wife and infant. She doesn't speak English or Hindi so I was helping her. We asked 3 different flight attendants for a child's meal on the flight from Mumbai to Amsterdam and all of them acknowledged by saying they would bring it but we never it got and no one came back with an answer. Customer service was poor with no smiles. They didn't ask what we wanted to eat, they simply give me what was left even though I wanted chicken, I ended up having a vegetarian meal. The washrooms were extremely dirty. I will not recommend with service like this.

### "they lose my luggage"
Amsterdam to Toronto. Worst experience ever. Not only did they lose my luggage, they have given me the run around and fake telephone numbers. They are rude and unhelpful. On the flight I took (transferring from El Al in Amsterdam) other customer I spoke to had their luggage lost and a terrible experience.

### "inability to improve food quality"
I have been flying with Jet Airways for over a decade. Have given them feedback on multiple instances about the food quality. Over the years the industry peers and the airline industry folks have also started to acknowledge Jet Airways inability to improve food quality. Reasons unknown to me. On my last flight from Bangalore to Delhi even the Crew accepted that they receive a lot of complaints about onboard food quality and that they have not been able to improve it for years now. Despite being a Platinum member, their staff directed me from pillar to post to get an upgrade despite presenting their own upgrade vouchers. They fail to acknowledge their own deeds (read upgrade vouchers). Anyhow, I believe they could be a better airline if it starts to keep the customer experience at the core of what they do. Alas today they don't. I am hopeful like my other colleagues and peers. But they don't have a long runway before they act on it and thats why many new airlines have started to beat Jet on multiple counts. I have uploaded a picture of a Low Calorie Meal that they served. Deep fried and full of oil.

### "seats unbelievably uncomfortable"
Mumbai to London with Jet Airways. Terrible food - on 8 hour 45 minute flight, lunch 1 hour after departure and then nothing until an hour before landing - not even any water! The lunch was the worst ever airline meal. The pre-landing food was yet another vegetarian wrap of appalling quality (like the ones we had had in the previous 3 weeks on 5 other flights with Jet Airways) with no alternative available. We were then offered 4 digestive biscuits! The flight was late with no explanation or apology. The seats are unbelievably uncomfortable - where you put your bottom was like sitting on wooden board - no padding. The seat pocket in front of me was broken at the bottom so even the in-flight magazine fell out, with the result I had nowhere to put anything. The pillow was filthy and had old food dried on to it. The seats were very dirty indeed. One toilet was blocked and failed to flush. The inflight entertainment is extremely poor in that there is no real choice of modern films and some are from decades ago.

### "a very pleasant flight"
Chandigarh to Delhi by Jet Airways's Boeing 737-700. The check-in was quite comfortable. We were warmly welcomed by the cabin crew while boarding the aircraft. The aircraft seemed clean and the legroom was also nice. The seats were having a very soft cushioning therefore it was very comfortable for us to be seated from such a hectic journey. The seats were also quite wide enough. The food tasted fantastic and the cabin crew was responding quickly to the calls of the passengers. The flight departed and arrived on time. The lavatories did not smell much but they can improve in this field. Overall a very pleasant flight.

### "does not know why flight delayed"
Delhi to Hyderabad. When I am on way to Airport at 15.45 pm I got an sms stating that the flight 9w 768 scheduled to depart at 18.30 is delayed by 1 hr 30mins to 2000hrs. The staff while issuing boarding card informs me that the flight will take off at 2200 hrs. Staff does not know why the flight is delayed. No announcement or sms only came to know by display board that the flight is expected to be departed at 2300 hrs. Tried to take courtesy meal provided by Food Court at Airport which is very bad and unhygienic. I reached Hyderabad around 1.15 am.

### "service was excellent"
Bengaluru to Delhi. Easy and user-friendly website. It took just a minute to complete web check in. Though I forgot to bring printout of my boarding pass, I was able to reprint it on airport on self chekin kiosk. Boarding process started well in advance, and takeoff was on time. Seat was clean but leg room was little congested. Though seat panel has screen it was turned off because of domestic flight, I guess. Crew were friendly and attentive. Good quality food was served soon after takeoff. It would be great if they put little more options. Flight arrived before time and disembarkation was very quick. Overall service was excellent and I will fly with Jet Airways again.

### "minimal hospitality services"
Mumbai to London, and a terrible travel experience with Jet Airways. Flight delays many happen with any airline, but not minimal hospitality services. My flight took off at 2am local time, they served dinner after 30 minutes, by which I was sleeping. Since I missed dinner, I had to wait until 10am local time for breakfast, and no refreshments or snacks were available. One lady next to me was waiting for coffee for 2 hrs. Since she is allergic to milk powder she asked regular milk in the coffee. Cabin crew finally served her request after 3 attempts.

### "experience was so bad"
Dhaka to London Heathrow via Delhi. This is my second time travel by Jet Airways. First time my experience was not bad but not good as well. My overall experience was so bad. Specially check-in at Delhi airport, where it took more than hour. Seat are so uncomfortable for long journey. Food is average. My flight was two hours late and no apologies from anyone. I will not use Jet Airways again unless I have to.

### "never expected such a bad service"
My journey date was 30th December from Mangalore to Dubai with Jet Airways. I had a connecting flight to Riyadh by flydubai. Due to fog in Dubai we had to remain inside the aircraft for 11 hours, and we missed our connecting flight to Riyadh. flydubai arranged next flight for us. When I asked in Dubai it was told that we will get our luggage in Riyadh, and so we proceeded towards the gate. It is almost 26 days still and we didn't get our luggage. Through my enquiry I came to know that it didnt reach flydubai service. Jet Airways customer care in Dubai not responding - I never expected such a bad service by Jet Airways.

### "inflight experience the worst"
Amritsar to London Heathrow via New Delhi. I have seen the Jet Airways quality of services going from bad to worst. The boarding experience at Amritsar and Delhi was pathetic and the inflight experience was the worst in my experience of 25 years travelling. I would rate Jet Airways as poor value for money

### "would travel with Jet again"
Abu Dhabi to Mumbai. My first chance to try Jet Airways regional business class produce, named Premiere. It started badly in the Etihad Premium Lounge, which to my shock was at 5pm not serving food and the spa was closed. Serious cost cutting here. Luckily I had access to another lounge. Boarding the 737 was efficient and the cabin was in reasonably good shape. The seats, just like Etihad's narrow body jets, are comfortable for sitting but not good for sleeping as they don't form a flat bed. Shortly after take off we were served drinks and warm nuts followed by a nice 3 course dinner. The food was slightly better than Etihad on this route. There were no seatback TVs, with inflight entertainment streamed via wifi to your device. I didn't try this as was happy reading. My overall verdict was of amazing service, and pretty good food and drinks. The convenient flight time and quick departure at Mumbai also made this a stress free trip. Would travel with Jet again given the reasonable fares.

### "no complaints for price paid"
Short flight on Jet Airways from Mumbai to Ahmedabad. Check in at Mumbai Terminal 2 was chaotic with a huge queue but moved reasonably quickly. Once onboard, the seating was poor. I'm glad I was only travelling for an hour as the legroom was extremely limited. However flight took off and arrived on time so no complaints overall for price paid.

### "happy with the staff service"
I was traveling from Bahrain to Mumbai on 7 January. There was fracture in my right knee, so I was coming India for treatment. I am very happy with the staff service, the cabin supervisor she provided a wheelchair for me on landing time and she treated me very well with her good communication and better servings.

### "they didn’t get me assistance"
My GoAir flight from Bangalore to Delhi in order to connect with my Jet Airways flight back to London was delayed by fog in Bangalore and the flight was 2 hours late to take off. A steward rang Jet Airways customer service on his own phone and explained the situation and told them I had 2 bags but they were both of hand luggage size and would they please let me on the flight if arrived slightly under their regulation cut off times but in plenty of time to get the flight, they said no. He pleaded with them, they said no. As it happened I caught the flight by 40 seconds - I joke you not but only because the Jet Airways flight had been delayed for 30 minutes because they had lost some passenger bags from one of their connecting flights. The flight did not actually take off 30 minutes late but an hour late and I was in danger of missing my connecting BA flight from Heathrow to Manchester. I spoke to the Jet Airways steward and asked him if he could get me some assistance getting across Heathrow, as it is a massive airport and I am 64 years old. He told me that he would speak to the captain and came back to tell me that the captain promised to radio ahead and get me assistance. But they didn’t, despite their promises and I had to run across Heathrow, arrived at security and found that I had been taken off the flight, but a really nice BA staff got me back on the flight. I got there in time but in a fit of paranoia quizzed the stewardess to make sure that they had not taken my bags, (that had been checked in in Delhi straight through to Manchester), off the plane and if they had that they had put them back on. I can assure you that your bags are on the plane she said, but they weren't and I had to stay at home all day the next day to wait for the courier to deliver them.

### "full service onboard"
Flew Dubai to Hong Kong via Mumbai with Jet Airways. Preferred airline for travel from Dubai to the East. Very competitve pricing compared to Emirates to the East. Full service onboard, food, drinks and entertainment. Staff sometimes a little undertrained. Run smaller aircraft like 737 and 320 between Dubai-India and uncomfortable, although recently 1 flight per sector is on 777 which is very welcome.

### "delayed by an hour at origin"
Bangalore to Abu Dhabi. Being silver guest of Etihad I booked this with them, but later realized this route is operated by Jet Airways. True to their reputation the scheduled flight was delayed by an hour at origin, over that we were denied boarding citing the connection time at Abu Dhabi is 50 mins so they can't allow us to fly but rater wait for 8 hrs for the next flight. After arguing 50 mins is good enough to transit and with no checked in baggage they finally allowed us board with remarks Jet Airways isn't responsible if the connection is missed. I was surprised they didn't give any benefits of silver guest as Etihad give lounge access for silver guest. Jet Airways ground staff could have handled it better. On board, all normal, the food was just ok. Ordered a special diabetic meal, but was served with carbs.

### "very bad scheduling and logistics"
Goa to Mumbai with Jet Airways. Flight delayed (2 hours going, 5 on return) due to lack of crew while plane sat on tarmac - effectively very bad scheduling and logistics management by airline. Lack of information, information only available either by word of mouth from other customers or interrogation of boarding staff - no imformation made over microphone. Boarding times inconsistent with flightstats.com which was always indicating later times, and staff were deliberately creating false hope of an earlier boarding time, and then bumping the time to meet the actual boarding time.

### "service veering towards pathetic"
Mumbai to Bangalore. I had come to expect quality from Jet Airways, but had a really bad experience with this flight. It started with extremely long queues for baggage drop. Worst was that the flight was delayed by 2.5 hours, because of which all my further planning got completely thrown off schedule. Jet Airways service is veering towards pathetic.

### "been degrading in its service"
Abu Dhabi to Chennai. Over the years Jet Airways has been degrading in its service. I was a transit passenger and I was allotted the last seat in the Jet Airways flight AUH-MAA. These days airlines have considerable information to provide an appropriate seat particularly for long distance passenger. There was no leg room. I was very tired after 10+ hour of flight with another 4.5 hours ahead. They dont have any control over how much luggage a passenger can bring. Ironically at the time of boarding they select passengers with troller suitcase as scapegoats to check-in their hand baggage leaving all the others who bring truck loads. Having alloted the last seat and crew taking their sweet time to reach the seat for serving meal, they didnt have the chosen meal. When I asked for a feedback form, initially the staff said that she will bring one. She came back later to say that "She has discovered that feedback form has been stopped and customers are asked to provide online feedback". I will avoid like a plague Jet Airways in Middle east segment. Not sure whether Jet Airways will match its code sharing partners like Etihad. Such mismatch will only spoil brand image.

### "not an airline you can depend on"
Jaipur to Kathmandu via Delhi. Appalling customer service. Flight firstly "rescheduled" to be 70 minutes later without letting passengers know (had the flight left I'd have missed my connection). Then the flight was cancelled due to technical (Jet airways - not weather) problems. Once cancelled took 90 minutes to be placed onto another flight by unapologetic staff who showed no sense of urgency to help their customers. No form of compensation was offered whatsoever (e.g. luggage storage, food / drink, upgrade, financial) - even when requested. Jet Airways is not an airline you can depend on when things go wrong. Would avoid.

### "Worst customer service"
Worst customer service possible. I travelled Jet Airways from Doha to Hyderabad Via Mumbai. I got to know on landing in Hyderabad that my luggage got stuck at Mumbai airport and after talking to their staff he assured me that I can collect my luggage next day and gave me their baggage enquiry landline number. When I called the next day, nobody would pick it up. even if when they picked up after 25-30 calls, they would say "Hello" and then would hang up on me and keep the dialer apart so that it will show busy. It's the ultimate humiliation a customer has to go through. Even during the flight, their staff are really rude.

### "everyone ready to help"
Mumbai to Hyderabad. This was my first flight with Jet Airways and an excellent experience. Everyone was ready to help and the flight was pleasant. The food, well, I just took a fruit bowl and it was really good. Enjoyed the trip.

### "No one knows what they doing"
We were traveling from Singapore to Delhi and our flight was delayed for over 7 hours. We were asked to stay at the airport and sleep. We were given lounge access for food which was not even worth eating. When asked for hotel then we were advised sorry we do not provide hotels. Wish they make clear at the booking that if flight is delayed there is no hotel provided and you are expected to sleep on floor at the airport. I had to cancel my hotel booking in Delhi for a night with no refund. Money is important issue most importantly inconvenience caused and not even an apology or any compensation given. No one in the airline knows what they doing. I have send them 9 emails but recieved one reply that we will come back to you.

### "welcomed by smiling crew on board"
Lucky to be upgraded to Jet Première (Business class) when I checked in just before the check-in closed. A separate queue for Premiere passengers, so boarding experience was hassle-free. Welcomed by smiling crew on board, provided with a complimentary drink just after boarding. Hot towel was served. Since IFE doesn't work on domestic Jet Airways service, only flight info like fight map, distance from destination, etc were shown on the seat-back screens. A decent meal was served, with beverage options (varieties of tea or coffee) and a dessert (apple tart or fruit salad). Seats were in alternate 2x2x2 and 1x2x1 arrangement in Premiere class (34 seats in total, on A330-300). I was allotted the window seat (3A) of 1x2x1, thus having aisle access as well. Seats can be reclined to 180° lie-flat beds. I did have a small 15-20 mins nap on a flight duration of 1 hr 40 mins although blanket was provided to those only who specifically asked for. Overall I enjoyed the Jet Première class to the fullest.

### "a very nice experience"
Raipur to Mumbai with Jet Airways. Flying for the fifth time and the experience was excellent. The crew on ground as well as onboard were well trained and greets passengers with a smile. IFE was previously available on short haul domestic flights but now it is not available. The flight was on time and the food and beverage had options of veg and non-veg. They provided tea and coffee along with Galaxy chocolate. The food and beverage quality was decent. Overall a very nice experience on the both legs of the trip.

### "very satisfying experience"
Flew from Mumbai to Bengaluru with Jet Airways. The check-in was quite easy. The lounges were fantastic and the staff was also nice. While boarding the flight we were warmly welcomed by the cabin crew. The seats had a very soft cushioning which were quite comfortable and also the legroom was nice. The food was served hot and was delicious. The take-off was a smooth one and cleanliness was maintained in this aircraft. Overall very satisfying experience with Jet Airways and will love to travel with them again.

### "flight was uneventful"
First experience with Jet Airways. When we booked this flight, it was mentioned as an A330, but three to four weeks prior to departure, flight number and the plane model was changed (Boeing 737-800). Just after check-in, a Jet executive scanned my boarding pass and registered me in JetPrivilege, it's FFP. Seats were in 3-3 configuration (as it was a Boeing 737-800), being on the last row of the economy cabin, I was unable to recline it even a bit. There were seat-back entertainment screens (previously I had travelled on CCU-DEL route many times with Spicejet and Indigo, which do not have such screens, being LCC), but was disappointed to note that IFE was not working at all. Being a full service airline, meal is served in all cabin categories. Food was okay, not too good. But after landing, when I asked about IFE not working, I got an extra chocolate from the FA (nothing exciting in this) that's when I was told that IFE doesn't work on Jet domestic network routes. The flight was uneventful overall. Talking about money, I had booked the tickets for a special discount fare of ₹4523 round trip, which was far too low (I was upgraded to Premiere class on my return flight).

### "the crew were friendly"
Bangalore to Singapore via Chennai outbound returning via Mumbai. Fairly pleasant overall, besides the domestic to international transfer at Chennai: the shuttle that transports passengers to the international side of the airport did not arrive for over 30 minutes under heavy rain. The crew were friendly and food great. The Boeing 737 on the Chennai - Singapore leg is hardly the most comfortable type to fly on for an overnight sector, the 777 was better on the return, and it was half-empty! I would gladly fly Jet Airways internationally again.

### "a pleasure to travel with"
Flew from Delhi to Mumbai on Jet Airways A330-300. The check-in was quite easy. While boarding the flight the cabin crew gave a warm welcome. The flight departed and arrived on time. Soon after the takeoff we were served with hot and delicious dinner. The aircraft seemed clean and seats were quite comfortable, and could be easily reclined. The cabin crew were polite and a pleasure to travel with Jet Airways.

### "whole episode quite traumatic"
Lucknow to London via Delhi with Jet Airways. My wife is a disabled traveller and even flying business class we found the whole episode of checking in quite traumatic. My wife has her own wheelchair which she keeps whilst waiting in the airport taking it to the gate on departure when it is then usually placed in the hold to fly home. Firstly on arriving at Delhi from Lucknow they refused to give us the wheelchair from the hold despite the fact the chair was stood on the tarmac leaving my wife stranded as she cannot walk the distances required in airports. After much arguing and trying to explain they sent a young man with an airport wheelchair which got us through to international departures to the U.K. However, on checking in for the Delhi to LHR flight, the check in staff seemed totally bemused and confused by my wife's request to keep the wheelchair and dispatching yet more staff to take us to the gate some 4 hours before departure - meaning she could not get anywhere if we had not argued for the wheelchair to remain with us until reaching the aircraft. We were amazed at the lack of understanding in relation to disability or wheelchair users. The check in staff didn't listen and was talking to 3 different people at the same time gave little attention to our problem. It was equally challenging through the security check. Both Jet Airways and Delhi airport need to train their staff on handling people with mobility is challenges. Total nightmare.

### "one of the worst flights"
Delhi to Bangalore on Jet Airways Boeing 737-800. At check in the agents were uninterested and didn't know which line to direct the passengers to. As the check in line for domestic was huge, one of the agent directed me to the international check in,and again I was directed to the domestic check in. Utter confusion and not knowing the process clearly. Boarding was on time with zone wise boarding, which the passengers stuck to on instruction of the Ground crew. Plane was almost full. FA's were just ok, neither too customer savvy neither too disinterested. Just average customer service. Inside the plane it was really cold and FA's didn't provide any blanket. I had done web check and had chosen Non Veg Meal. I was one of the first ones to get a meal, was a little apprehensive about it. On the top of the box was written- Non Veg Meal -LD (maybe meaning light dinner). Inside was a small portion of noodles and 2 chicken balls. It was really inadequate. Dessert was a small bar of Kit Kat. Was really disappointed with the meal portions and presentability. I regularly fly Jet Airways and this was one of the worst flights I have travelled on.

### "unexpected positive surprise"
London to Colombo via Mumbai. This was an unexpected positive surprise. The food is almost exclusively Indian, so if you never order from an Indian take-away, preorder special meal. However, what we had was very tasty and reasonably sized. The beverages were similar to those served onboard Qatar, the crew was prompt, smiling and welcoming. Also the ground experience was very nice, nothing to complain about really. Some people mentioned terrible smell from the toilet on some flights - in none of the four flights that was the case for us, even though we were sitting very close to the toilets on both B777 trips. The in-flight entertainment had some good selection and kept me occupied for as long as I required. Also seats and legroom were good. To sum up if I have an opportunity to fly Jet Airways again, I will not hesitate.

### "biggest let down was in the food service"
Flew on Jet Airways B777-300ER between London Heathrow and Mumbai. The boarding process was unorganized. The cabin had a foul smell on LHR to BOM flight, but not on the return segment. The in-flight entertainment is a bag of surprises. The content is outstanding. Excellent collection of movies and songs. Only downside is that the touchscreen felt sluggish and not calibrated properly on both segments. Perhaps the biggest let down was in the food service. The quality and quantity of food will not meet the expectations of most international travelers. Overall, the cabin of B777-300ER just felt old and not well maintained. The cabin crew and their attitude towards customer service was excellent. The ground crew in Mumbai were also very friendly and helpful.

### "food tasted fantastic"
Flew from Chandigarh to Delhi by Jet Airways. The check-in was quite comfortably done. The flight departed and arrived on time. The seats were quite comfortable and the legroom was nice. The aircraft seemed clean. The cabin crew are very polite. They have a welcoming nature. The food tasted fantastic. Had a great experience with Jet Airways.

### "keep flying with this airline"
Delhi to Mumbai. Jet Airways knows how to welcome its passengers, cabin crew are very polite and have a welcoming nature. The food tasted fantastic and the legroom was good. The cleanliness was maintained on this aircraft. Overall flight experience was fantastic and I keep flying with this airline.

### "cabin crew very attentive"
Overall a great flying experience with Jet Airways from Deli to Pune. Seats not very wide, yet very comfortable. Cabin crew very attentive and happy to help. A meal service was also provided without any extra charges. Food seemed to be good but didn't have anything due to airsickness, but the cabin crew were nice enough to help me out through it. Departed and arrived on time, seat belt sign came on a few times but no turbulence materialized, so they were being cautious on this front which was a good thing.

### "the experience was positive"
Abu Dhabi to Ahmedabad return, my 4th and 5th flight with Jet Airways in the past year and the experience was positive. The outbound flight was delayed by 2 hours which didn't cause us any issues, but I didn't like the fact that there was no announcement or reason given and we had to rely on the information boards to find out. I think the crew make Jet Airways better because they are friendly and helpful. The outbound flight was at night and inbound was early morning and my kids were very tired and hungry, but crew were happy to provide extra food and drinks with a smile. The seats were comfortable and the entertainment system sufficient for the 3 hour flight. You do have to press the touch screen quite hard to get it to work, but the choice of movies is good.

### "inflight entertainment very poor"
Pune to Dubai via Delhi, and Jet Airways is my preferred choice for this journey. Somewhat uncomfortable seating, had to get up few times in 3 hour journey to free my legs. Cabin crew was attentive and helping elderly and first timers during boarding. Meals were average as expected. Inflight entertainment was very poor quality. There were screens installed above head so that 2 seats (6 people) can (or have to) watch whatever they play.

### "a very pleasant flight"
Mumbai to Delhi with Jet Airways. This airline never makes its passengers unhappy. This I have experienced in my travel with Jet Airways. The cabin crew welcomes passengers very warmly. Followed by the smooth takeoff, we were served with delicious and warm lunch. The seats were also very comfortable and the flight arrived 15 minutes before the standard time of arrival. It was a very pleasant flight and would keep flying them.

### "a very pleasant flight"
Flew with Jet Airways from Delhi to Mumbai. It was a very pleasant flight. The flight departed late but arrived on time. The cabin crew were very polite and the pilot kept us well-informed about the weather and the delays. The landing and take off were smooth. The seats were also wide enough and the legroom fantastic. The food also tasted nice and cabin cleanliness was well-maintained. Jet Airways could improve its service by installing onboard Wi-Fi(s) on all of its aircrafts.

### "service was as usual good"
Dubai to Delhi on Jet Airways. Flight was on time and load was full. I do not understand why Jet does not use wide body like A330 on this sector as B737 feels cramped. The service was as usual good with a tasty and warm lunch along with drinks. The IFE had adequate selection of Hollywood movies. Arrived on time in DEL, which is always a pleasure. Would continue flying with them.

### "always a pleasure"
Flew from Aizawl to Calcutta and return. In writing the flight time was 1.30hrs but it was around 1.10 hr on both flights. Clean aircraft, chicken/veg sandwich, crews were attentive/smiling, the Captains on both flight gave information about flight/airport details twice - on ground and before landing. Always a pleasure flying with Jet Airways.

### "seats were worse than budget airlines"
Flew Singapore to Chennai with Jet Airways. Even though this is a full-service airline, you cannot choose seats until 24 hours prior to departure time. You must check in between 24 hours to 2 hours of flight time. To choose a seat beyond that time, payment is required. Inflight, the seats were worse than budget airlines I have taken and are in quite a bad condition. The seat pockets are torn, reclining seats are not working properly, the plane we took was not well maintained. Leg room very small for anyone beyond 175cm in height. When pushing the food carts, the crew members hit my seat (and the one in front of mine) a few times and they did not even have the courtesy to say sorry. When food and drinks were served, the crew left 2 drops of tea on me and as usual, I did not hear any apologies. No more Jet Airways for me.

### "do not use Jet Airways"
In October 2015 we had booked return flights with Jet Airways from Kathmandu to Brussels (which was then the European hub of Jet Airways) via Delhi, departing on 2 April 2016. However, Jet Airways moved its European hub from Brussels to Amsterdam as from March 2016. As a result, they were unable to fly us to Brussels on 2 April 2016 and flew us to Paris CDG instead. We were made to organize and pay for our own transport from Paris to Brussels. Extensive e-mail exchanges with their Customers Complaints Dept to obtain compensation for our travel costs Paris - Brussels got us absolutely nowhere, even though they had to admit that they had paid compensation to friends of ours who were in the same situation and even though the CAR regulations oblige them to ensure at their expense transport to the final destination. They even had the nerve to suggest that we book with them again to earn double air miles. They know very well that it's not worth pursuing them for EUR 337 so they just don't care. Advice: do not use Jet Airways. We sure won't be that stupid again.

### "a very unpleasant flight"
Flight from Toronto to London is operated by Air Canada and London to Mumbai is operated by Jet Airways. Both flights have same aircraft (B777-300ER), Air Canada flight was a pleasure. seating was ergonomic and there was enough leg space. I was able to sleep without too much of a hassle. Flight operated by Jet Airways was a different ball game though. First thing I noticed on entering the aircraft that interior was not up to the mark, the seats were bulky and this gives less space to manoeuvre. Pocket in front of my seat (used to keep magazines and small personal items) was torn and I couldn't do anything about it. Toilets were dirty to begin with and interior was practically falling apart at multiple places. Seat was not comfortable. Close to 9 hours flight and my backside hurt like crazy. Could be because of quality of seating cushion or just that the seats were pretty old. Had to keep shifting and fiddling with the pillow to make sitting bearable. Overall a very unpleasant flight.

### "they were arrogant"
I was coming from USA via Etihad and the last flight from Abu Dhabi to Bangalore was via Jet Airways. I was not aware that Etihad has partnered with other airlines. From Chicago to Dublin was with Aer Lingus, then from Dublin to Abu Dhabi was with Etihad. The itinary of my entire flight allowed 2 check-in luggages with 23 kg each and 2 cabin luggage. When I was boarding the plane from Abu Dhabi, Jet Airways asked me to keep my hand luggage and not take it as the space was limited. I explained that I did not book Jet Airways ticket and was booked through Etihad which is partner with Jet and you should allow me 2 hand luggages as mentioned. They were not ready to listen. It was as if I was not obeying the rule. But the fact was they were arrogant and not understanding. At last when I said that I would not board without my hand luggage, they allowed me. Upon reaching Bangalore and waiting for my check in luggage which did not come, I inquired about the same. I was informed that probably it has not made it and will be send. There were around 14-15 people whose luggage was missing. There was only 1 person to take note about the same and fill papers. So if 1 person taken 3 minutes, than the last person number would come after 45 minutes. I was probably the 2nd last and my number came after waiting for 40 minutes. So after the plane arrived, when all passenger were gone, I was left to look where to go for missing luggage, I had to wait additional 45 minutes. Now when should I expect to receive my luggage ? I received my luggage after 48 hours. This too after calling them up atleast 4 times. For missing baggage, the wait time on call was around 20 minutes. When the person answered the call, he did not have any information. The call center was of no use and I was only informed that the bag has been traced and will be send ASAP. What is ASAP is left to Jet Airways discretion. If after 48 hours is ASAP, I bet what could be sending the luggage in relaxed manner.

### "a pleasure flying with Jet Airways"
Jet Airways is the best domestic airline of India. They have maintained excellent cleanliness on all of their aircrafts and the cabin crew are patient, listening to the problems of their passengers. The leg space is also good. The restrooms are not smelly like some other airlines. The overhead compartments were quite large. The food was delicious and the seats were comfortable and could be reclined easily. A pleasure flying with Jet Airways and I will surely opt for it again.

### "food and drinks adequate"
Delhi - Dubai on Jet Airways, B737-800. Flight departed late but was on time in Dubai. Service was fine and food and drinks adequate. No personal IFE but a small screen dropped from the overhead bin and movies were shown, which was disappointing. Jet Airways should seriously consider upgrading their aircraft to at least an Airbus A330 if not a B777. The high load on this particular sector warrants this change. Apart from the aircraft and the IFE, no major issues. Will continue to fly with them.

### "quite good and beyond expectation"
Mumbai to Hong Kong with Jet Airways. The flight was quite good and beyond expectation. There was quite a good variety of movies ranging from different languages and genres, thus, the 6-hour long flight was not so boring. Cabin crew were friendly and not quite lousy. The aircraft looked well-maintained. The food was quite delicious.

### "improved it's service"
Flew from Banglore to Mumbai. Jet Airways has improved it's service compared to last year. The cabin crew were friendly and the food tasted fantastic. The seats of Business Class were comfortable and could be reclined very easily compared to last year. The Boeing Sky Interior looks fantastic at night. The only problem is that it doesn't have onboard Wi-fi.

### "journey made me more tired"
Abu Dhabi to Chennai with Jet Airways. Ground service to enter bus took lot more time than usual. We were kept standing on line which moved very slow. Inflight crew were very cold in approach. They just completed their task. No spirits visible. After a tiring 8 hrs Manchester to Abu Dhabi previous flight, this journey made me more tired.

### "service was impeccable"
Mumbai - Dehradun - Mumbai. Jet Airways direct flight to Dehradun from Mumbai indeed is a saving grace in terms of time and convenience. They are the only airline offering a direct flight from BOM hence able to skip the chaos and nuisance of transiting through DEL. Both flights were on time, and service was impeccable. Their cabin cleanliness and ambience is what I really like, and both aircrafts had the sky interiors. The legroom on their 737 is pretty good and me being 6”1, I was still comfortable. The food was also really good on both flights, especially the desserts which had a nice brownie on the outbound and a lovely tiramisu on the return. I guess their BOM based catering company servicing their flights is indeed fantastic. Also flying out of BOM T2 is always a pleasure. Their cabin crew seemed a little tired and lost, otherwise the experience with my favourite Indian airline was lovely.

### "quick and efficient"
I was impressed with my first flight with Jet Airways from Bangalore to Delhi. Jet Airways is a full service airline. Check in was quick and efficient. Although my checked bag and carry-on exceeded the maximum weight according to their website, I was not charged for excess baggage. Boarding was painless and we took off on time. Before take-off I was given a bottle of water. During the 2 hour 20 minute flight we were served a light meal and beverages. Due to bad weather we circled Delhi for half a hour but the pilot kept us well informed. Baggage was delivered quickly. I will certainly fly Jet Airways again.

### "attendants nice and helpful"
Delhi to Singapore return with Jet Airways. Flights on both legs were almost on time. The seat configuration was 2-4-2 which was convenient as we got allotted on window side seats. The leg room was decent but the aircraft was a bit old. No USB point for mobile charging, although there was IFE with reasonable amount of movies and songs (mostly Hindi). The food was ok but not that great and limited option for alcoholic drinks with just a single brand for whisky and a single brand for beer. The food had just 2 choices either veg or non-veg. On my first leg, my special meal request was met but it was tasteless. The attendants were nice and helpful.

### "never encountered such a disgusting smell"
Chennai to Madurai. Seems like Jet Airways thinks it doesn't need to make any effort on this route. The scheduled time of my outward flight was changed three times (once while I was actually at the airport) - maybe this is a way of reducing delay statistics? Also the flight number was changed without me being informed, for no apparent reason except to cause confusion. As a result of all this I had to spend nearly three hours at Chennai airport, so resorted to using the lounge for a payment of 943 rupees - fairly small, with a limited food and drink selection but free wifi. The flight was OK except for the food and drink - 250ml bottle of water and inedible 'chicken' sandwich (or veg alternative) with a tiny kitkat. On the return journey I had the misfortune to use the toilet. I don't think I've never encountered such a disgusting smell in my life, it nearly made me vomit. I also now understand why the seats at the front of the plane were full, despite the only entrance and exit being steps at the back - the smell began wafting into the cabin. With a stifingly hot bus ride to arrivals, all in all a thoroughly unpleasant experience. I wonder if SpiceJet is any better.

### "reasonably pleasant for Economy"
Mumbai to Singapore with Jet Airways. Award redemption booking done smoothly on-line. The trip was reasonably pleasant for Economy class. Web check-in was quick and airport verification/bag drop off fast. Boarding early and a bit chaotic, departure was slightly delayed due to ATC. Lunch was ample and tasty. Service businesslike, not friendly or unfriendly. IFE had a couple of movies I hadn't seen before so I was suitably entertained. Bags arrived within five minutes of me reaching the belt. My normal grouse with Jet is that they have reduced the seat pitch to the point of discomfort, but on this occasion I had the front row and an empty seat next to me, so not an issue this time.

### "very pleasant cabin crew"
Mumbai to Bengaluru and return. Very pleasant cabin crew, clean aircraft, a good meal (had pre-ordered a low cal meal). It is good to see Jet Airways improve its game quite a bit. The legroom remains a bit of a challenge but other than that the seats are quite supportive and comfortable for the 2 hours or so domestic flights. With Indigo increasingly opting for the really uncomfortable slimline seats, I find Jet again becoming my preferred airline.

### "onboard meal was fresh"
Vishakhapatnam to Delhi. This is the best airline for domestic in India. The seat recline at its best compared to other domestic airlines in India. On-board meal was fresh. On-time performance. Hospitality is good and polite attendants. Overall a good experience.

### "flight was a disappointment"
Kathmandu to Varanasi via New Delhi with Jet Airways. Check in with long queue and slow check in. Flight delayed twice without any information before (no email or even sms) from the company. All ground crew was below average. Sweets served onboard were stale. Overall, the flight was a disappointment and you should think carefully before using this company.

### "difficult to get out of seat"
Goa to London via Delhi. We have traveled to India on many airlines, but our last encounter on Jet Airways was a nightmare. We were delayed 4.5 hours because there was a problem with the plane, but we were left on the plane all that time. We were kept informed three times during the whole experience. Once we were transported off the plane to another one (having boarding cards checked yet again). We started our journey and this was the most uncomfortable flight I have been on. The seats are hard,  inflight entertainment was the same as the outward journey. The food was only just warm and when the seat in front of you is reclined it is very difficult to get out of your seat, anyone who is not agile will struggle. On a positive note, staff were very good, facilities were kept clean. The food would have been tasty if it had been warmer.

### "economy seating is so cramped"
We were rerouted due to BA being late departing BOM that day, Jet Airways was on time. Were happy to discover a newish B777-300ER on the Mumbai - London Heathrow sector and despite being seated far apart, the ground staff managed to get us together on this full flight. The joy soon faded after entering the aircraft because their economy seating is so cramped (3-4-3 across) and not enjoyable when the cabin is full. However, the cabin crew were very hard-working and customer oriented and the meals tasty for Economy, moreover, the IFE had a good selection and we managed to watch three films during the flight. The sound and picture quality was good. The most important thing is that landing at LHR was ahead of schedule, which left us enough time for transiting from T4 to T3 and have a bite before heading for the next flight. 5/10 for seating, 9/10 for meals and 10/10 for the excellent cabin crew.

### "most uncomfortable 9 hours"
Mumbai to London with Jet Airways, was probably the most uncomfortable 9 hours of my life. The seats are tiny and rock hard. Service is rushed, and food is more or less thrown at you. My wife and I never did get a hot drink throughout the flight - the staff just rushed past us. Inflight entertainment was fair though the touch screen isn't easy to use. We had travelled out to India by the same airline in business class which was fine, but there were 4 seats across the plane as against ten seats across the plane in economy, that says it all really. Never again!

### "a pleasant surprise"
Travelled Bangkok to Ho Chi Minh City on the 7/3 2016 on a B737 machine with Jet Airways. Smooth check-in, seat wish and a few kilos of overweight were accepted without any remarks. Flight departure and opening of check-in counters were on time. They use AF's Skylounge in Cocourse C, to which one can pay access if not elite traveler. Once in the air and the seatbelt sign was turned off, only 10 minutes after take-off, a big tray of cold, canned beers was dished out to any thirsty economy passenger who wanted. Only 10 minutes still later, hot meals were already dished out smoothly. Quite acceptable food quality, 2-3 offers, inc. vegetarian. Staff nice and in good mood, despite the flight was almost full. More drink-rounds later. Generous luggage allowance. The flight duration is only 90 minutes but despite the short time, the pax were well pampered for. The ticket was promotional and costed me around 80 USD which was a true bargain. Staff hard working and managed well the many passengers. Calls by call-bell were addressed. No reasonable inquiries, requests, or orders were declined nor forgotten. A fully fledged airline, and a pleasant surprise after reading several negative reviews. Will fly again.

### "not at all satisfied"
Dubai to Kochi with Jet Airways - I have travelled twice with Jet and both times I was not at all satisfied with the airline. The aircraft was not properly cleaned, there was dirt on the tray and seats and the visibility through windows was poor. The entertainment screen is not easy to use and overall the interior of aircraft was so dull - it felt old. The only thing I liked was the meal which was fine.

### "no idea of customer service"
Mumbai to London with Jet Airways was the most awful experience I have had on an airline. The cabin crew disappear after giving you your meal. When you call them they come to you with a 'false smile'. The wine was awful. The plane was unclean and extremely noisy. I had booked a specific meal after struggling to log onto the website. Was not served the meal ordered. The trays were not cleared for an hour after we finished, longer for the kids as they were served an hour before us! The entertainment on board was basic to say the least. We felt like unwelcome guests! They have no idea of customer service.

### "give minus 10 for service"
Goa to London via Mumbai. If I could give minus 10 for service I would. I had the misfortune of booking Jet Airways on an initial flight of 3 legs to get me from India to the US. In short, a trip that should have taken at most 30 hours ended up taking 40, which lots of frustration along the way. The flight was delayed, and 9 of us were at risk of missing the same connection in the destination city. We asked the staff to help us make arrangements to make this connection with on-the-ground staff. After repeated inquires, the staff assured us that calls were made and ground-staff were ready to shuttle us directly to our next flight. Turns out neither the flight crew nor ground staff were notified; in fact, arrangements were made for other (domestic) connections, but nothing was done for our global one, which impacted 9 people. No communication - we missed our connection, and spent the subsequent 1.5 hrs fighting for attention from the Jet Airways desk to rebook our remaining legs. It seems that shouting and screaming at them (done by other customers who were behind us in line) was the only way to get someone's attention, never mind tend to you. When at last tickets were supposedly rebooked, I went to check in with the other airline, only to be told that the ticket was not processed correctly and was void. And since the flight was overbooked, there was no way to get on it anyhow. This led to another 2 hours fighting for help from JetAirways to get proper rebookings, with correct class. While the subsequent ticket for leg #2 went through fine, the ticket for leg #3 in London was again "invalid", as well as booked for the wrong class. If it wasn't for helpful British Airways staff that stepped in to call Jet Airways directly to sort things out, I may still be in London right now. In-flight was fine, but that's all they have going for them. I had a great experience with Etihad Airways, but unfortunately due to this hellish experience I am remiss to use them again for the fear of getting booked on another Jet Airways flight.

### "all legs were excellent"
Flew Jet Airways from LHR-Delhi and Mumbai-LHR on return, also had an internal flight from Delhi-Thiruvananthapuram. All legs were excellent. The LHR-DEL flight was comfortable and the food was very good. It was an overnight flight so we got dinner and breakfast. Service was efficient, cabin crew were very professional and friendly on all legs. The internal flight was also very good on a tidy and clean 737-800. Everything ran on time and I would definitely choose to fly with Jet again.

### "ground operations terrible "
Flew from Delhi to Lucknow with Jet Airways. Long queues at check in even after web check in, very few members of staff maning the check in counters during peak hours. Not so polite ground staff - if you enjoy any of these, please fly Jet. While inflight experience and meals are a big plus, handling of ground operations by Jet Airways is terrible as experienced thrice in 2 months.

### "1-2-1 layout in business"
London to Mumbai with Jet Airways. The seats, entertainment, service, and food were all amazing. They offer a turn down service and pyjamas. The seating layout is 1-2-1 layout in business cabin, so its not jammed.

### "flight a disappointment"
Bangkok to Delhi with Jet Airways, check in with long queue and slow check in. Flight delayed twice. Boarding was okay, but crew was below average. Sweets served onboard were stale. Overall, the flight was a disappointment. My previous experiences with Jet Airways were better.

### "overall, average flight"
Delhi to Bangkok with Jet Airways. Check in and boarding smooth. Boeing 737 was ok and staff did a acceptable job. There was no personal IFE and seats were cramped. Food was average but the biggest problem was lack of adequate toilets onboard. There were only 2 washrooms for over 150 economy passengers which led to big ques in the flight. Overall, average flight.

### "warm snack and a muffin served"
The Jet Airways flight from Mumbai to Goa is about 50 minutes, however, a warm snack and a muffin was served by the friendly crew. The web-checkin including seat reservation and the check in at Mumbai airport were very efficient. The plane - built 2004 - was in a good condition with clean windows.

### "Great service"
Mumbai to Singapore with Jet Airways. Not being the biggest fan of this airline, I was surprised how they have grown up. The flight was on time - even arrived early. Great service, food, and plenty of soft drinks on offer during the flight. The in-flight entertainment was great and the crew were happy to assist.

### "service was good"
Mumbai to London with Jet Airways, having flown earlier from LHR to DEL. They use Boeing 777 on both the routes. The herring bone pattern in business class gives a full flat seat, duvets were provided along with PJs. As the BOM-LHR flight took off at 0225, most of the pax prefered to sleep rather that have the dinner available. I had good 6 hours sleep. The breakfast was edible with choice of menus. My only gripe is the herringbone seating deprives all seats of window views. The service was good and FAs professional. The fast track immigration card at LHR was welcome relief as the queues via normal channels were serpentine! The cabin was clean and fairly new.

### "seating is diabolical"
London to Mumbai with Jet Airways, and the seating in economy class, especially for such a long haul flight, is diabolical. The seats are extremely narrow, even for a slim person and the leg room is so cramped. The pocket flap in front of the seat is so tight, one can just about store a few papers. One is constantly disturbed by the passenger in the next seat as there is really no room to keep both arms on the arm rests without touching the other person. Really diabolical experience seating wise on such a long haul flight. At the same time, fares are among the most expensive.

### "poor customer service"
Jet Airways flight from Bhuj to Mumbai uneventful. Good on time service and great crew who worked hard on this one hour flight. All the good work of the crew laid to waste once at Mumbai. Plane parked at international terminal. Then bussed to Domestic so that was another 15 minutes. Then it took them over one hour to get our bags. They had no clue where the bags were and they kept saying that the trolleys had left. Poor customer service and once again shows you why Jet Airways is losing its customer base. Only reason we flew Jet is cause it has the monopoly on the route.

### "now it's horrible"
I have been flying from Jet Airways for over 8 years on the Mumbai to Jeddah-Riyadh-Mangalore routes. It was very good in the beginning and now it's horrible. Staff don't welcome the guest, no smile on their face and not at all interested to serve the guest or it's a burden for them to do. On my trip to Mumbai from Riyadh on 15th December, they served the food very late because it seems like they didn't had enough Flight Attendants. After serving the food so late, they were not bothered to collect the trash back. After waiting long time left the trash under the seat hoping that they will collect it back later, but when I went to the toilet I found they are napping inside the galley. Jet Airways tickets are so costly during the seasons and this is what the service is - the answer is simply carelessness because there are very limited flights from Riyadh to Mumbai/Mangalore.

### "seats are mighty uncomfortable"
Flew several Mumbai to Delhi flights with Jet Airways last year, the best value domestic airline. Full service at competitive airfares and usually on time. Food is passable but nothing to write home about. Cabin crew offer basic courtesy, but seats are mighty uncomfortable - slimline and a cheap faux leather make them noisy as well as backache inducing.

### "seats not very private"
This was my first experience flying with Jet Airways. The route (Toronto to Bangkok) is very long but I choose it because there is a long layover in Delhi where I had booked a room at the hotel in the airport. The flight stops in Brussels for a few hours to change crew. When I arrived in Toronto I was relieved I had booked a business class seat as the check in line up was huge but the wait for priority check in was only 10 minutes. The staff member in Toronto was fantastic and assisted me with all of my questions and assured me my luggage would be taken care of on the long layover in Delhi. If you are traveling alone you should try and sit in seats that are alone next to the windows (every 2nd row) but these go quickly and although the airline had guaranteed I would have the seat it was only available on one leg of the flight. This is not herringbone seating I had been told it would be which was disappointing. The seats are not large and not very private compared to modern business class seats of today. They are almost flat bed but since I am over 6 feet they could have been a few inches longer. Service was the issue for me. The flight attendants make you feel like you are lucky they are serving you. No one offers you a vanity bag or pajamas unless you ask for them. When you request something to drink or eat they look at you as if to say - "really, you want me to bring you that now? I just stopped asking for things so I guess it has the desired affect in the end because it gives them more time to play on their mobile phones in the galley. Movie selections were not very current and there were limited choices compared to the Middle Eastern airlines. Food quality was not very good for business class. I was expecting more, especially from the Indian dishes. The lounge in Brussels is fine and there is 1 shower so you need to hurry if you want to get to it before the other passengers beat you there. They have a nice selection of pastries and even a few Belgian beers to enjoy. The staff were friendly. The lounge in Delhi was not so nice, I expected more for a home base in India. Food selections were poor. Be warned that the airline operates from gates that are very far from the terminal so expect a 15 minute walk to reach your gate in Delhi. I would not fly this airline again. The Asian and Middle Eastern carriers are far Superior in business class.

### "trip was better than my last"
Mumbai to Kolkata return It has been over a year since I last flew with Jet Airways, and this trip was better than my last trip. The aircraft was good, the meals were quite decent and the inflight service courteous even in economy.

### "most uncomfortable flight"
Flew Jet Airways mainly because of the competitive prices and timings they offer on Mumbai to Singapore return. This would probably be one of my most uncomfortable flights taken ever. Dated 737-800 aircraft, with very limited IFE options - you'd be lucky if your screen works without a hassle. Seats are extremely cramped and for a 5 hour 30 minute flight, I really wish they'd go back to operating A330's for this sector. This is unpleasant. Cabin crew were ok, quite disinterested. On the SIN-BOM sector, one crew snapped at another in front of everybody for a tiny little mistake she made, its something you do not do! Food is average, nowhere close to the old Jet Airways quality. Boarding and ground handling was alright. Overall the convenience of the timing and a non-stop flight is fine, but I do hope they give us a larger aircraft or better seating on this aircraft one day.

### "it was a good service"
Jet Airways provided good service over all on their domestic route from Kolkata to Mumbai. Check in was quick and the flight left on time. The meal served on the short flight was ok. Interestingly enough, the airliner parked at the international terminal to accommodate passenger transferring to an international flight. We climbed on a bus to the domestic terminal and our bags were there to greet us. Overall it was a good service.

### "seats comfortable enough"
After reading horrible reviews here me and my wife were pleasantly surprised with our flight on Jet Airways from SIN to DED via DEL. The meals were standard aircraft food, seats comfortable enough and cabin crew very attentive and approachable. Aircraft was reasonably clean too. Could do better by improving the cleanliness of toilets although this is not a fault of the airline but that of inconsiderate passengers who do not know how to use modern toilets. For the price we paid, we were happy on all four sectors.

### "useless customer service"
Booked a one way Jet Airways flight for me and my wife from Toronto to Brussels but made the colossal mistake of typing one letter of my wife's name wrong. Immediately tried to correct this but travel agent, Flight Network could not (or would not) do this. They suggested we go to airport early and hope we have no issues! As an alternative, buying a brand new ticket would solve this problem (now $780). Not thrilled with this so began contacting Jet Airways directly - have never in my life met such useless customer service, nobody gives you an answer, they don't reply to e-mails and generally speaking, they just didn't care. Eventually spoke to someone at head office in India whose only comment was "we don't do name changes" Decided after many sleepless nights to take our chances at the airport and thankfully, nobody noticed the error. If you check their website, they state "ensuring the highest standards of quality and service" - just hilarious.

### "gone completely downhill"
Absolute disaster - bought ticket easy enough through their website but they booked me on the wrong date (2 weeks too early.) I called them within 5 minutes of the booking and told them and was kept on hold (international call) for almost 40 minutes. After talking to a manager they said there was nothing they could do and it was my fault and "How could I put in the wrong date? Explained again and said any carrier would make the change (tons of seats available) if the pax called immediately and they said they would not do it. Typical call center incompetence - nobody knew anything. So I called my credit card company who happily cancelled the booking and refunded my money. Bought a ticket in 5 minutes on Indigo and then again on Air India. Jet Airways has gone completely downhill.

### "disastrous onboard service"
Jet Airways from Toronto to Brussels. Web checked in, and disastrous drop off luggage, no fast track at airport. A good Air Canada lounge to use in Toronto. The boarding service was messy, and disastrous onboard service all the way. I found food inedible, and also terrible IFE. The cabin staff were smiley. Food was yet disastrous and so were drinks. Toilets were not clean or always available, and a crying infant in Business class topped it all. Flight attendants tried to be nice. Bags not first out! Still wonder if my miles will not go missing.

### "seat was a little uncomfortable"
Pleasantly surprised given some of the reviews here. Had cause to call Customer Services a few times in the weeks prior to departure-both times my enquiries were dealt with promptly and  efficiently. Check in at LHR was equally quick, efficient and polite. The plane was boarded and departed well on time. Food was good by airline standards and drinks were generous. IFE possibly a little dated but perfectly adequate. The seat was a little uncomfortable but on an 8 hour flight most economy seats are. I even managed a wee sleep. In short Jet Airways got me on the plane, fed me, entertained me and got me to Delhi - and back - safely. For the price I couldn't have asked for more. Would definitely recommend and use again, especially if the prices are kept as competitively low compared to the completion.

### "no announcement"
I had booked for flying Jet Airways flight 468, Chennai to Mumbai, which was scheduled to flyout at 18.10 hours. When I reached the airport and took the boarding pass, we were told that it was on time. While at the lounge, it was rescheduled to 18.25 and later to 19.15 hours. Later, there was no announcement and the next flight which was to leave at 19.30 hours was called up, people started making enquiries about the earlier flight. What we were told was the flight 9W468, was on time, but got diverted to Delhi and many smart people who got wind of this, got themselves booked on the next flight, but the hapless guys like us in the lounge who were unaware did not do so. When queried repeatedly, they told us that both the flights will leave almost at the same time. When I went to the gate, I saw that the boarding had just commenced for our flight, whereas for the later one, the gate was closed as boarding had got completed. The trouble did not end there. After we boarded the flight, it was extremely cold and when we asked for blankets, the hostess told rudely that they have run out of stock and we have to manage. The head stewardess admitted that they carried only 12 blankets and as soon as it ran out, they could not accommodate others.

### "on-board service was very good"
Flew Jet Airways from BOM to BDQ on economy class. We stood in Check-in line for a very long time since passengers ahead of us were arguing with ground crew about being bumped from an overbooked flight. At check-in, we had to pay an exuberant sum of money for baggage fees. We had just arrived in Mumbai via Etihad Business Class and had four check-in bags with us. Despite the fact that Jet Airways and Etihad are strategic partners, Jet Airways didn't waive domestic baggage fees for international customer. The boarding area at Mumbai Airport is incredibly small and seating arrangement is limited. There is also no jet bridge, so you have to take a bus to the aircraft and then board via stairs. The on-board service was very good. Really liked the breakfast as well.

### "flight was horrible"
The check-in was nice as staff at Heathrow were helpful. The flight was horrible, with really small screens. My entertainment was reset 3 times and I had to wait for 1 hour to get it working. Staff were busy with something else and did not actually help me, even after my constant nagging. Really cramped. Will avoid.

### "Indigo has wider seats"
This is the 2nd time I flew on Jet Airways to London. This time in August 2015 the check in was bad due to really long lines, despite the presence of many more checkin counters at the new Mumbai airport terminal. The staff wasn't professional. The cabin crew gave us fake smiles like they are doing us some favor. The new layout of 3x4x3 made the flight really cramped. It felt more like a domestic flight with narrow seats and no footrests. There was no cup holder either. Indigo has wider seats. The cabin crew seemed to prefer being there for you at their own convenience. Food was not satisfactory. The trays, cups, cutlery etc were not that good as far as quality is concerned. The ambience was not good as there was no mood lighting and no music ever played. I managed to get 4 hours of not so good sleep, perhaps because I had an aisle seat. Despite being an aisle seat, it was uncomfortable. Toilets weren't maintained well. The soap dispenser ran out of soap. The aisles were quite narrow too.

### "very poor inflight experience"
The Jet Airways Boeing 737-900 seat pitch is really uncomfortable, and they used same high configuration for international flight as they use for domestic service in india. Cabin crew was not very attentive, and a very poor inflight experience.

### "I would not fly Jet Airways again"
I arrived at Bangkok Airport to find out my Jet Airways business class seat had been changed to economy and the seats I had chosen on the connecting legs were also not available. One point about Jet Airways explained to me by the manager at the airport is their customer service line in the US is an outsource call center and famous for making mistakes. I did talk to them many times to confirm my seats and none of what they confirmed was the case. So I was very disappointed. The plane was not full so I was able to get a seat in the aisle with no one in the middle seat. There were in seat movies on this leg but on my return flight from Dheli to Bangkok it was a different plane, with no in seat tv screens which made the flight long. The staff are good in the cabin and attended to everyone. Movie selection was limited and they had to reboot the system mid way on the flight. Food was good, they had vegetarian selection which was nice, a good beverage selection and staff handed out water bottles. Long lines for the toilet as there are only 2 toilets on this plane for economy. I would not fly Jet Airways again because of their customer service skills, trying to pass the buck on to other sources like blaming the outsource call center, and the fact that I never felt that they were coordinated on the 6 flights of theirs I took on this journey.

### "I would avoid Jet Airways business class"
My overall experience was not positive with Jet Airways, mostly their very poor customer service. Jet Airways in the US explained that the seat configuration is herringbone (which I prefer) but it turned out to be a regular seat pattern. I found this out after I had made my booking and then requested a particular seat that would allow me privacy as a single seat but when I checked in I did not get the seat, even though the call center confirmed I had the seat on 3 different conversations. The response from ground staff was that the call center is an outsource business and really does not know what is going on! The staff attended to your needs but you never felt that they were really trying to take care of you. Food was acceptable with a couple of menu options for vegetarians. Portions were small. The food from Brussels to Toronto was poor. Films were not current, about 5 months for the newest release and not a large selection compared to other Asian airlines. Seats were flat beds and hard. Lots of bedding was provided. I was not asked if I wanted pajamas or offered a refreshment kit but I noticed others received it. The Jet Airways lounge in Brussels was comfortable but old and dirty. There was a shower but you need to reserve it as soon as you arrive or you may not get a chance to use it as there is only 1. Food choices were limited. I would avoid Jet Airways in business class and stick with major airlines that know how to provide comfortable and attentive service in business class.

### "staff not responding to call buttons"
I recently flew with Jet Airways on 2 flights, from Singapore-Mumbai and Mumbai-London. Neither was particularly impressive. On the first flight the inflight entertainment was nonexistent - the movies would not work, neither would the TV shows. Several passengers sitting nearby had similar issues. The seats were extremely uncomfortable. Staff were friendly and food was good. On the 2nd flight things were worse. I found the cabin crew to be very rude - not sure if this was only to passengers in economy or to everyone. Bad attitude when boarding the plane, not responding to call buttons, very unimpressed. Again the seats were ridiculously uncomfortable even by economy standards. On my outward flights I'd travelled with Singapore Airlines and I wished I'd paid the extra to stay with them for the return flights. Again the food was good (more would have been good though, I have a hearty appetite), but again entertainment was not great. My screen worked this time but the sound quality was poor. Lesson learned : pay the extra for a better quality airline than Jet Airways.

### "poor product compared to Qatar Airways or Emirates"
I flew Jet Airways business class from Delhi to London. By the time boarding is announced in the lounge, the gates are almost closing. So it is a hassle to rush and board. Jet Airways is now on a cost cutting mode. They have stopped giving night suits and amenity kit. It was a day flight but surely one still can use the kit. When I wanted lotion I was told to go to the bathroom. People like to change into comfy clothes on a long flight. Indian food was very poor, and no yogurt or pickle was provided. For an Indian airline, their food is worse than on Air India. The crew does not bother to refill drinks. One has to ask and that is met with an annoyed look. Overall a poor product compared to Qatar Airways or Emirates.

### "old with poor inflight entertainment"
Jet Airways return flight from Dubai to Mumbai. The aircraft were old with poor in-flight entertainment systems. Both ways the TV screens wouldn’t work and their touch pads were worn out. This was really frustrating. It was just not us, but I could see another 15 passengers complaining about the same issue. This airline is not a budget airline and their prices are just 10% lower than an airline like Emirates, so I wonder why Management and technical department don’t rectify such minor issues. I wouldn’t travel again with Jet Airways.

### "customer service is the worst"
Delhi to New York via Brussels with Jet Airways. Food was okay, but not between Brussels and New York. When it comes to calling Jet Airways customer Service, or getting anything from their customer service, it is the worst. They do not pick up calls for at least 20 minutes. They would find excuses in not adding miles. Its funny they do not accept Passport as a Valid ID to add miles considering that all governments uses passport as a national id. They made us go outside the gate at Brussels which is a connecting flight. We had to do security checkin again. I feel that this connection is not a good connection to travel.

### "a long queue at the check-in"
Bangalore to Delhi with Jet Airways There was a long queue at the check-in counters due to the morning rush. Even though I had web checked-in, I had to wait in the normal queue for about 30 minutes to drop my bags. A separate counter for baggage drop would be appreciated. The rest of the journey went smooth, and cabin service was great.

### "plane looking like a spare bus"
A Kochi to Manchester flight (by Etihad Airways), where Jet Airways operated the Kochi to Abu Dhabi sector with a plane looking like a spare bus from a cheap operator. Poor seat cover, no IFE system, terrible air conditioning, no apologies. I wonder if it is regular for them? Having paid good money one doesn't want to start a near 19 hour journey, with 5 hours on ground in between, like this. Be very careful with these lot.

### "seats were like an old bus"
Mumbai to Abu Dhabi with Jet Airways. My wife and I were travelling to the Seychelles via Abu Dhabi with Etihad Airways, but Mumbai to Abu Dhabi was operated by Jet Airways. The Boeing 737 was small but very old, the entertainment system was not working and seats were like an old bus - very uncomfortable. I felt like I am flying on cheap flight on a domestic route. The food was also terrible and tasteless. Do not recommend to fly with Jet Airways on this route.

### Jet Airways customer review
I have used this company a few times, never had issues so far. Friendly staff and planes with more leg space than other airlines. Flight entertainment is not new and when you return it's probably not going to be changed with any with new movies. Food onboard is one of my favorites.

### Jet Airways customer review
Flew from Newark on an evening flight arriving into Brussels well ahead of time. Got 1 meal which was a dinner served about 1.5 hours after takeoff. Check-in was smooth and the staff was very helpful. Aircraft was extremely clean. Meals weren't too bad. BRU-DEL takeoff was in the morning and arrived in the night. Was served two meals which were lunch and dinner. Flight was excellent but had a 1 hour delay.

### Jet Airways customer review
Really pleasant early morning flight, shared lounge was OK but only wanted a coffee. Check in superb and crew responsive and pleasant. Food was tasty and for a short flight service could not be faulted. Plane looked new, seats were reasonably comfortable and bags off soon after arrival at the carousel.

### Jet Airways customer review
Check in had a glitch when bags were almost checked through to the final destination but was noticed by the porter assigned to us. Told at the lounge no time to enter 40 minutes ahead of take off and we could see the gate a few metres away. Flight itself was uneventful with a professional crew and nice tasting and well presented meals. On time arrival and bags were waiting. All you could want from a domestic flight really.

### Jet Airways customer review
LHR-HKG via BOM. Efficient check-in and boarding, both flights departed and landed on time. Breakfast was a bit grim but lunch/dinner and snacks on board were tasty and of good quality, also plentiful. Cabin crew were friendly and efficient throughout, a big improvement from my previous experiences with Jet. Seats comfy enough, especially the bulkhead seats. Luggage arrived very quickly at the other end, including oversized/fragile bags. No problem at all with the flights. Connection in BOM was a nightmare as usual. Lovely new terminal but same old shambolic organisation and confusion and overcrowding, caused by a combination of both airport/security staff and Jet Airways ground staff. Considering they are routinely the cheapest airline for flights between UK and HKG, Jet is great value for money.

### Jet Airways customer review
Flew with 9W on a mixture of aircraft and routes during the recent trip to India (SIN-BOM, BOM-ATQ via DEL, ATQ-MAA via DEL, MAA-CJB-MAA, and MAA-SIN). Punctuality was impressive even though the age of the aircraft operating the SIN-BOM sector left a lot to be desired. The tray holder kept popping off and the IFE was dysfunctional. Quality of meals on all sectors was decent and the service standards consistent. Whilst there's been a discernible overall improvement since the Etihad partnership, a revamp of the fleet seems imperative.

### Jet Airways customer review
Good flight BOM to BHO and return. Flights all on time. Food on these small sectors is an awful roll which Jet needs to change. Coffee on Jet has got to be the worst I have drunk. Staff and crew are polite and efficient and the flights were on time.

### Jet Airways customer review
Was rung at 1840 saying your flight is delayed and you won't make your connections. Get to the airport and see the duty manager. Problem - Bangalore Airport is about 1hr away, so asked the phone agent to persist and find out how to change. The thought of a night at Chennai didn't excite. Eventually said I'd been put on a SQ flight at 2335, be there 4hrs before so grabbed bags and dashed. At the airport some confusion and they checked me onto an earlier flight to Chennai, uneventful but I just knew the bag would be left. It was. Horrible wait in smelly, cramped airport lounge only slightly better than an airport that smells like a WC. 2am departure on time and told bag didn't make it. Business class not worth it for the flight. Old seats, no foot space, didn't use IFE as tried to sleep for 4hr flight. Pleasant crew but incompetent ground handling. Won't do this one again. Bangalore-Singapore direct is more sensible.

### Jet Airways customer review
Hadn't flown Jet for over a decade. Apprehensive after the reviews. This was the start of the India portion of a long business trip. Boarding easy, if a little rumble of passengers desperate to be first on. Sat on Tarmac for an hour as a sick person disembarked and security was rechecked, twice. Over an hour late for pushback. No water offered. Flight was smooth, polite staff. Exit row seat was a consolation to no business availability. But it doesn't recline, for 5 hours. Food was beautifully made, with the whole Indian veg/non-veg. Basic drink/refreshment. Limited but good IFE with small screens. Three hours in had a medical emergency on board. Well handled. Flew past Chennai to Mumbai and pulled up for ambulance. Despite sick passengers, aircrew made up time. Cabin crew were great. Needn't have worried. For all the incidents, well done.

### Jet Airways customer review
Short hop on older 737 with no IFE at dinner time. Left late. Didn't know what to expect. Mumbai domestic is fairly plain. Made to queue in an orderly fashion. Then queue again. Surprisingly good food onboard. Pleasant and efficient service although body odour of some staff was a little strong. Apart from the late departure, I've been pleasantly surprised.

### Jet Airways customer review
LHR-BOM BOM-MAA. The meal was poor. The quality of entertainment was not satisfactory. There was transit from Domestic airport to International in Mumbai. No proper direction from the ground staff and felt they were not concerned at all, in spite of the flight from London Heathrow with numerous transit passengers. The staff attitude was very poor. Both on my onward and return journey, the snack was bad and no tea was provided citing climate reasons. But, crew would selectively serve Hot coffee to some. Seat were normal and comfortable. The service was delayed by close to 1 hour and return flight was on-time. This is a low quality service airline.

### Jet Airways customer review
Both flights (DEL-CCU, CCU-DAC) departed on time and arrived early. The meals / snacks were reasonable and seats relatively comfortable for economy. It was a bit of shambles when we landed in Kolkata as the plane was going on to Port Blair so they then had to check each ticket (in the pouring rain) to make sure no one on the continuing flight was mistakenly getting off. Overall a pleasant experience.

### Jet Airways customer review
A330 in 2-4-2 configuration. Long queue for check-in with only 8 counters operational. No attempt to segregate single travelers with minimal luggage from others, which they do sometimes. Aircraft clean, comfortable seats. A snack after take off and breakfast before arrival - this was the terrible part. The snack labeled VLML (special meal) turned out to be the same baguette with extra spicy filling that everyone else got. The main meal was again spicy, greasy Indian style food. Crew were sympathetic but couldn't do much. Return was a B777 in 3-4-3 configuration - seating was cramped and uncomfortable. VLML meal loaded from HKG was decent and cabin service was good.

### Jet Airways customer review
I have been a loyal Jet Airways member for the past 8 years. Year after year I have seen their services slip. Inedible food, poor cabin crew, dirty aircraft and the list goes on. This particular journey was the worst till date. The seat and the leg area was not cleaned. When I called the cabin crew, she said she would clean it, however the aircraft was getting ready for departure and the crew asked me to have a seat in the filthy area.

### Jet Airways customer review
Delhi to Singapore return is a narrow body aircraft which is typically used in domestic sector in india. The space between two seats is so less that headrest of the front row seat hit me when reclined. Some of the seats don't straighten up properly. The entertainment system does not function properly (had to do without it on my return flight). The inflight food service is poor, staff missed passengers in their service and the passenger in front of me had to call the steward to get his meal. They seem to be short of staff.

### Jet Airways customer review
I flew this route to Delhi approximately two years ago and the service then was much better than what it has become now. Firstly this is a 4 hour flight and they do not have any inflight entertainment. Two years ago they had seat back to screens with quote a few movies. The food was also below average. The aircraft from Bangkok to Delhi was absolutely filthy. Some sticky liquid had probably been spilt all over the tray table. Jet Airways has dropped in its standard of service over time. I have flown many flights on low cost budget airlines in India which offer much better service than Jet. Would not travel again.

### Jet Airways customer review
This flight was sold by Etihad as a code share but operated by Jet Airways. The 737-800 was in good condition and the flight departed on time. Seat back video screens worked satisfactorily but choice of movies and shoes much more limited than the market leaders. Drinks run before dinner. Alcohol served but limited selection. The hot dinner was tasty but only indian veg and non veg options were offered in economy. Strangely no more drinks were offered during dinner. Coffee and tea came round later. The crew were rather robotic and did not go the extra mile. Comfortable seat although had an exit seat. The toilet cleanliness deteriorated rapidly during the flight and they were almost unusable by the end. Arrived on time at Abu Dhabi but slow to disembark and lengthy bus ride to terminal.

### Jet Airways customer review
Travelled from Delhi to Mumbai, 9W 354 departing Delhi at 7.45 pm. Flight delayed due to technical fault announced. However all passengers made to sit in aircraft by 8.15 pm. There was no AC working, captain informed that cooling would be better once airborne. After take off no effect. Captain says he would inform a technician to rectify it after landing in Mumbai. They knew in Delhi that the AC was not working, they allowed the flight to take off.

### Jet Airways customer review
29th May and 2nd June 2015 9W10-11 - Mumbai - Singapore and return. 9W10 - Day flight - Lunch was hardly adequate and within an hour we were hungry but still had about 3 hours to destination. The flight attendants were very nice but all they had to satiate our hunger were Mcvities single biscuits. Inflight entertainment was poor the monitors and touch sensors were hardly working. Need replacement urgently. Had headache and severe ear pain by the time we landed. 9W11 - Late evening flight. Flight was full started over an hour late although we were all seated inside the aircraft. Frequent announcements were made which were precise and informative. Very cramped flight and when the person ahead reclined his seat it was almost jutting into me. Dinner was not so good and inflight entertainment had the same items as in the 29th May flight. Although a number of programs are listed in the inflight magazine most of them are not loaded or incorrect programs loaded/linked. I requested for earplugs before landing which never arrived. Nor did the flight attendant bother to inform me of their non-availability. Had a good opinion of Jet with whom I have travelled before on domestic flights. This one left a bad experience on many fronts and a sore body by the time I landed. Seriously a total review of the seating comfort needs to be done at the earliest.

### Jet Airways customer review
I took four internal flights in India with Jet Airways during June and all of them were on time or early. Check in at the machines was a doddle and enabled printing of boarding passes for both outward and return journeys which saved time. My only minor grip is that the seating could have been better - it was rather cramped on full flights and the cabin attendants weren't the most friendly. However they got me from A to B punctually and safely.

### Jet Airways customer review
My first experience with this airline will certainly be the last. Firstly I found the cabin crew to be at best unhelpful to bordering on being rude. During an 8 hour flight from London to India was easily my worst experience with any airline. However it was not just the cabin crew who provided such a negative interaction but the ground crew were as equally unhelpful. At Mumbai airport following a personal bereavement the staff and supervisor were not only dismissive but showed a complete lack of customer service and empathy. I have travelled with multinational airlines and this is the first time I have ever had a reason to complain as all my previous experiences have been extremely positive.

### Jet Airways customer review
We have recently flown Business Class to Dubai as well as Bangkok from Mumbai and decided never to travel Jet to an Asian destination again. While their longer-haul aircraft and cabins are good their short-haul flights are an apology for Business fare travel with dated seats no leg rest no personal entertainment systems. Bangkok as well as Dubai airports having terrible depressing business lounges for any airlines besides their own national carriers. Have rated value for money as Fair below just cause we pre-booked these tickets at discounted rates.

### Jet Airways customer review
I fly YOW-RSW regularly throughout the winter months. Usually 4-5 return trips each winter and I always book Plus seats (1d). I have to say I enjoy the flight but they have to do something about the seat. Yes there is 2 inches more leg room but it's the same seat. No widest no more comfortable. No issues with flight attendants as I find WestJet employees usually very good.

### Jet Airways customer review
This is without doubt the worst airline I have flown with. I did arrive safely at my destination which is the important thing but the 8 hour flight from Heathrow to New Delhi was completely lacking in anything describable as customer service. Jet Airways is let down appallingly by its surly unhelpful and in some cases unpleasant staff. They seem unable to smile bark orders out (and I'm referring to tray collection and window blinds here!) and excel at providing bad service. Everything and every passenger seems to be a chore to them. The airline's ground staff (Jet Airways desk at Mumbai airport) are equally rude and unhelpful. My advice - avoid travelling with this airline at all costs! There's plenty of others to choose from who excel at providing great customer service so choose one of those instead.

### Jet Airways customer review
Can anyone answer a question. I flew WJ from Halifax to Edmonton non-stop my ticket was booked premium seating by my employer. I did get the free two bags and my seat was row 4. I was however offered to Purchase food from their onboard cafe menu. Because this was booked by my employer I wasn't sure about the meal and although I thought we were entitled to this I was a little embarrassed to ask so I declined to purchase food. I may be wrong but isn't the on board meal included in the premium seating. I am flying back home this week as well with a premium seating ticket my flight is over 6 hours with a short stop in Ottawa. Just one more thing - why do passengers have to pay to watch a movie. If the meal is included why would a flight attendant ask me to purchase it.

### Jet Airways customer review
I was flying from Vancouver to Fort St. John with my 3 year old son and our plane was delayed 8 hours. I was stressed about having to be stuck there that long with nowhere to nap or entertain my son. The agent booked us a room (on WestJet) for the day at the hotel airport where I was able to bath and nap him. They also gave us food vouchers for the whole day. A few days later I received an e-mail apology with 20% off our next flights. I must say this is the best customer service I have seen. They turned what could have been a horrible stressful day into a fun day at the airport for my son and stress free for me. I will fly WestJet anytime I can. I highly recommend.

### Jet Airways customer review
Flew LHR-BOM-BKK (9W117/9W060 on 25th/26th May in Economy. Usual service except that for LHR-BOM all four of the mid-cabin toilets were out-of-action on a full flight from shortly after take-off! Their B777-300s with the extra 10th-seat squeezed-in are also starting to look slightly-worn. As usual no seat-back IFE on the B737-900 BOM-BKK just the little drop-down screens. Transfer-security at BOM which used to be a real hassle in the old terminal was once again rapid and efficient with no queues!

### Jet Airways customer review
Mumbai to Singapore and back from Singapore to Mumbai 24th April-12th May. The seats were terrible so much less legroom - we were almost cramped. On the return flight there were a few arguments amongst passengers when they were trying to recline their seats. My experience was so bad that I will never travel on Jet and never recommend.

I recently flew Kochi - Dubai - Kochi. I had a very interesting experience on the return leg. During lunch service I asked for a Beer. I was served a warm flat can of beer that was lousy. I waited patiently until the stewardess came around for the 2nd round and requested a vodka. The reply given to me was "No. I cant serve you a Vodka because you had earlier asked for a Beer". I told them that the beer was warm and flat to which the solution offered was "I will serve it with Ice". When asked why this stupid rule the answer was "This is company policy Sir". I refused their beer. Thank you Jet Airways for the lousy flights you operate with no entertainment cramped seats et al this is really the icing on the cake. Lousy attitude.

Flew from Dublin to St. John's and then to Halifax on May 11th. Flight 2 hours late out of Dublin but I don't think this inconvenienced many travelers. We had a 4 hour scheduled stopover in St. John's so it was better to spend 2 hours of this in Dublin. Airline was good in notifying us of delay in departing well in advance (inbound aircraft was late). Full 737 with average flight attendants and in flight entertainment. No food is offered on this flight other than a small amount from a buy-on-board menu. No big deal if you know this in advance as I did. Have a wonderful Irish breakfast at the Dublin airport before leaving and you'll be fine as the flight to St. John's is only 4 hours and 20 minutes. Good water and soft drink/coffee runs and a fast and convenient way across the Atlantic.

YYZ-CCC and return. April/22/15- May/2/15. We fly out twice a year for vacation and have positive experiences flying WestJet. Going to Cayo Coco was on a 737-700 and on return was 737-800. Both flights had working seatback TV's the staff were pleasant and the planes were clean. We will continue to fly with this airline.

We travelled in April 2015 from London to Delhi (connection to Amritsar) and Mumbai to London (connection from Goa). The seats were fine food marvellous entertainment OK cabin crew not too bad. The only thing I can complain about was the info we got at Heathrow from the check-in representative who told us that we would not have to collect our luggage at Delhi before boarding Jet Airways internal flight to Amritsar which turned out to be wrong. We did have to collect it and then check in again. If we had not done we would have been in trouble.

Flew Business Class Bangkok-Mumbai-Paris CDG R/T. The flight from BKK to BOM was very average on an old 737. Eight business class seats that barely reclined no foot rest no in-seat entertainment system just one very small video screen on each side of the aisle that dropped down from the ceiling and showed one movie. Food OK service good and friendly. Would not recommend Jet Airways for this segment in business class for a 5 hour flight - no value for price. BOM to CDG was on a modern A330 with herringbone flat bed business class seats great 100 channel personal entertainment system with a very large video screen massage function in the seat very private configuration power and USB outlets nice duvet for sleeping food and service very good. However our flight was 2 1/2 hours late taking off due to air traffic congestion in Mumbai. Because of this we missed a connecting flight in Paris and had to stay overnight. It took the ground staff 2 hours to sort out our new flight the next morning iand arrange for our airport hotel in Paris (Sofitel - they paid) but we were not able to retrieve our luggage so no fresh cloths the next day. Our return flights had ticketing/computer problems which caused delays with our check-in and none of the special meals we ordered through their website were ever delivered for any of our flights. Jet Airways is really hit or miss and I would not fly them again unless no other choice available.

YWG-YYC-PSP-YWG March 28th and April 5th. Price was reasonable given it was Spring Break. Check-in at Winnipeg was smooth with the self-serve kiosks reasonable wait for security and boarding was smooth (priority boarding due to exit row seat worth the extra price) as were departure and arrival in Calgary. Waited more than the announced 20 minutes for baggage to arrive at transfer carousel but customs was smooth. Despite many young families security was reasonable. Had time to relax at pay-in lounge. Renovations at boarding gate but hold room added extra space. Boarding was efficient with many children on this flight departed and arrived on time in Palm Springs. Baggage was within 20 minutes. Check-in at Palm Springs was efficient and handled well. Rode the Disney Plane back to Winnipeg a nice touch with interior decor. Departure and arrival on time and worth the extra for direct flight. Customs in Winnipeg was smooth and wait for baggage was longer than announced 20 minutes. On all flights snack and drink were served with water runs IFE functional with a number of selections on each plane and the cabin crew were friendly polite and efficient. Seats slightly stiff which became uncomfortable after roughly two hours. Overall a good experience and will book with WestJet again.

My flight was from Toronto to Punta Cana (Dominican Republic) in Mar 2015. The very first negative experience was at the check in counter WestJet people meet you at the front of the line and push you to use a machine (before entering the line) where you must do all the work instead of WestJet agents. We had to scan our passports check in print tags weigh baggage as well tag our own bags. After all that was completed we had to go in a long line up and wait for someone to check our boarding passes and baggage tags and do something in their computer. After all that they made us put our bags on the baggage belt send them away. Why such a high price if they are making passengers do all the work? Boarding experience was not much better it was so disorganized and long due to excessive amount of carry on bags. People were bringing on huge bags. Inflight crew were ok but they were annoyed with the whole situation with carry on baggage. Soon as everything was sorted out we left the gate and took off. Inflight service was unreal seats super tight no movies or TV and no food. I am not sure why people fly WestJet?

### Jet Airways customer review
Flight 1221 FLL-YYZ April 16. Poor customer service is the name of this airline. The flight attendants were rude and treated us without much respect. If you ask them a question or if you ask them for a service they give you a look as if they have been insulted. When paying for a drink the selection of liqueur is extremely poor. Their website is of substandard quality and lacks features of many other airline websites. For example when checking in online from the US it won't allow you to send your boarding pass to your mobile phone to check in with. It won't allow you to put your pass ID for TSA pre-check so you won't be able to use the TSA pre-check lanes at security check in. When asked them why they don't offer these features now standard on all other North American airlines the answer was a simple "we just don't". On the plane the seats are extremely old and worn out. Many of the little TVs on the back of the seats are broken and don't work.

London - Mumbai - Goa in Business Class. The London-Mumbai business class section was sold out. However the staff were very attentive and professional. Breakfast and dinner were excellent with a good selection on the menu. I highly recommend the Indian food! The seats were very comfortable and I slept well. I had a 6 hour wait at the Mumbai airport. I took my time to admire some of the art at the incredibly beautiful international terminal. The transfer from the international terminal to the domestic terminal was easier than in past years. I was disappointed t learn that Jet Airways does not have a business class lounge at the domestic airport so my wait was not as comfortable as I would have liked. The service on the Mumbai-Goa flight was simply superb! We were in the air for just over half an hour and were served a full breakfast. I will certainly fly Jet Airways business class again.

London-Amritsar (18 March) return flight Delhi-London (14 April). If you are worried that transfer time at Delhi Airport which is about two hours may not be sufficient to go through immigration collect your baggage and then catch the onward Amritsar flight don't. You only need to collect your baggage. You don't have to re-check in for Amritsar flight at Delhi. Your baggage is checked in for Amritsar at London airport and you are given the Amritsar as well as Delhi boarding passes. At Delhi airport you collect your baggage go through the Green channel and head for Domestic transfer which is barely five minutes walk. At the domestic transfer your passport and boarding pass are checked. On entering domestic transfer you place your baggage on the conveyor belt and head for domestic security. The entire process - immigration collecting your baggage and catching Amritsar flight - takes no more than forty to forty five minutes. Moreover Jet Airways ground staffs at the baggage collection belt are there to guide you to the domestic transfer. However I have two complaints against Jet Airways. The first is that their in-flight service is simply appalling. The in-flight crew do bare minimum. They simply disappear after serving the meal. If you need anything you will have to run after them. There is however a good variety on the meal but not on the drink menu. You are unlikely to get a service with a smile on the Jet Airways - its in-flight crew in my views are not properly trained. My second complaint is its bad time-keeping. My Delhi-London flight was 1 hour 30 minutes late not because of any technical reason but because Jet Airways could not leave without picking up passengers from its Kathmandu-Delhi flight. If you are thinking of booking London-Amritsar flight your best option in my views is still Air India not Jet Airways.

### Jet Airways customer review
Recently travelled to and from Hawaii out of Vancouver. These routes use Westjet's newest version of the B737 yet they are the most uncomfortable seat that I have ever sat in. Absolutely bare minimum support ultra thin and have no built-in entertainment system. Obviously the need to cram that extra row of seats into the aircraft is more important than customer comfort. On our return from Kona to Vancouver the plane seemed to have a very quick turnaround and after only 90 minutes into the flight all 3 toilets became inoperable and were overflowing. It was obvious that no servicing had taken place following the flight out and a full flight was forced to endure a further 4 ½ hours without using the onboard facilities. This we felt was disgusting and irresponsible.

We flew from Brussels to New York last week and I must say we were a bit scared after reading some negative comments on this site. But what a pleasant flight it was. Great staff good food good seats great comfort and individual entertainment (movies music games). Indeed as we flew in economy we did not get a fresh towel when boarding we only got 1 glass of wine but hey that's economy. I would certainly fly with Jet Airways again!

Flew out March 11 Heathrow to Delhi. Had 4 internal flights over the next 3 weeks and then flew Mumbai to Heathrow on March 31. Everything was excellent food drinks and all flights were on time. Crew were all excellent. Jet business class is as good as Virgin Upper Class. Will fly with them again.

### Jet Airways customer review
My second time travelling Jet and I must say I am utterly displeased. The first time I went from Mumbai to Abu Dhabi to catch a connecting flight there and I must say that it wasn't anything to remember. The seats were okay and the food was fine. It is very low class in front of its partner Etihad. But the second time around I was very disappointed. We were travelling from Mumbai to Bangkok and the first thing that we noticed on the plane was that there was no entertainment system! I was shocked and the final blow came when my mother asked for a blanket which are usually placed on our seats in all international flights and do not have to be asked for the attendant said that they had run out of blankets. I think Jet overbooked the plane and did not have enough resources. The seats were good and the food wasn't bad but the above couldn't be compensated.

We booked our flight with Wizz Air because it was the most affordable option to get from point A to point B. That said we definitely got what we paid for – long waits (for seemingly no reason) out-of-control lines with no rules being enforced for the “first come first served” boarding process and the airline staff themselves (maybe contracted – couldn't tell) even allowed people from the back of the line to jump ahead of others who had been waiting for 30+ minutes to board. Due to this my husband and I were unable to sit next to each other during the flight – and we were finishing up our honeymoon destinations. If you're looking for no frills long lines and no rule enforcement Wizz Air is the way to go.

Went to Kuaii Hawaii 2 weeks ago through Vancouver. Had a bad headwind from Vancouver so we were late. I can understand this. My complaint is - If there is a more unpleasant seat to sit in in the world I don't know where it is. Not for the legroom I paid extra for the exit seat but the seat bottom is like sitting on a wooden park bench for hours at a time. Surely with today's technology WestJet can come up with something a little better than this.

Been flying with westjet for work purposes for years. Flew from Calgary to Toronto last Tuesday. Was sleeping woke up coughing and needed a drink of water. Waited ten mins for attendants asked for water waited 15 minutes she walked by again and I told her I really needed something to drink waited another ten mins. Third time I waited five more mins. Almost four mins later another attendant who was serving water behind me gave me a drink. Spent a lot of money with Westjet over the years.

We were a party of 4 flew from London Heathrow to Delhi on the 11 March 2015. The check in was seamless and the guy behind the desk couldn't have been more helpful or accommodating. The seats were great - plenty of room and the airplane was a fairly new Boeing 777. The staff were generally very good but the stewards were more accommodating than the stewardesses - why I don't know. The flight was on time and it was a good all round experience.

I booked a plus seat paid an extra $400 for flight to treat myself. This is a joke says you can order off menu for food. Choice dried out bun or dried out bun. On return trip stewardess was so rude to myself and other guest those who drink (it was included in plus seats) were scared to ask for one. I was cold the whole trip but thought I would get a lecture if I asked for a blanket. She proceeded to give me a lecture on the way off the plane for where I stored my purse. She saw me getting it in and out for 5 hours but waited until she had an audience to go at me. Hope I never have to fly this airline again.

WS3415 March 19 to Thunder Bay. We arrived home at 4 am today. Our flight was late as they said they waited for a group of 19. Do you realize how many were on plane who had made arrangements for pick up. Then we get to park and fly and machine wouldn't take ticket. Phoned for help and gentleman couldn't get it after 6 tries. In Thunder Bay granddaughter asked for earlier flight as grandson was sick. Attendant agreed but had to get it signed and this one couldn't subtract 2 from 3 as one was having to stay back. Granddaughter in Thunder Bay is disappointed as she says we wont come back.

### Jet Airways customer review
London-Cochin-London 16/02 and 1 internal rtn flight Cochin-Mumbai-Cochin 24/02. No issues at all with the internal flight - left on time and excellent crew. International flight both outbound and inbound was well below what we have become used to with Jet. We were sat at the back in the 2 seat config this time giving me a little extra room to stretch out 1 leg where the 3rd seat would have been. Seat pretty comfy. Staff were very low quality! On way out as boarding was occurring an argument broke out between two passengers - 4 crew stood around like spare parts whilst the passengers argument got more and more heated. Rather than take control of the situation to ensure comfort of all passengers they just stood there looking very lost. Totally and utterly useless! Service through the outbound flight was perfunctory at best and you got the impression any passenger awake they viewed as an inconvenience rather than someone contributing to their wages. The look I had when asking for a coffee mid flight said it all. Food was pretty good on outbound and return flight. On the return flight the staff were marginally better but not a lot. Again you got the impression we were an inconvenience simply being on the flight! Requests for more coffee or snacks was met with the look of "oh if you must! They need to allow the volume to go higher to block out ambient background cabin noise! I wasn't using their own headsets having learnt before they are tinny ultra quiet and liable to fall apart but my own set and even with the volume on mine set to high with volume on entertainment unit set to high you could still hear much of the noise on the aircraft well other than the PA announcements which came through at a deafening level! In total contrast the staff on the internal flight were the polar opposite friendly welcoming humorous and did their level best to ensure a great flight and for them nothing was too much trouble. This is how Jet was on all their flights previously and this was quality of service combined with stunning value. The value Jet offers is very good on ticketing prices the inflight entertainment is pretty good and the food better than some - but their staff are really becoming budget Ryanair type staff. I'll still fly Jet on our next trip to India but if the service is the same or worse then I'd rather pay more for a ticket to get full value and quality.

Wonderful trip from Toronto to Brussels Brussels to Delhi. For economy the food was great and tasty. They provided chicken filled pastries which were nice in between the main meals and lots to drink. Beer whiskey coke. The crew was very nice and generous. Tickets are a bit pricey at times but it's worth it. The newer A330-300's are very nice and are new/modern. Will fly with them again!

Jet Airways are simply not in the big league. Without a change of culture training and people they never will be. Flew Singapore Delhi and return in economy. Staff can be good if they feel like it but after take off from Changi they lost all interest. Delhi to Singapore was forgettable. Food is poor service is basic seat comfort poor entertainment very average. Overall avoid unless necessary.

Fine for a short haul. Flew Kochi to Chennai (1 hour 25 minutes) with no delays or problems. Tickets for this leg were dirt cheap too. For simple domestic flights within India this seems like a good way to go (we also took IndiGo which was fine and Air India which was a mess).

### Jet Airways customer review
YVR-OGG - A brand new Boeing 737 plane with a spacious interior look/feel. The staff were professional and courteous and the overall flight experience and passengers mood was calm. The legroom was great due to WestJet putting in new slim seats but these were a bit hard and uncomfortable on your posterior. The other negative aspect was the complete lack of in-flight entertainment system! The reason given was that WestJet is rolling-out a new entertainment system where you can use your smartphones/tablets but this wasn't ready yet. They did however rent tablets with pre-loaded movies which seemed were quickly snapped up and looks like an extra way for them to make cash. It was frustrating that there wasn't even the moving map being displayed on flip-down screens (which didn't appear to be installed on that plane). Luckily I brought a book and magazine to keep me distracted for the 5h30 flight to Hawaii.

### Jet Airways customer review
Thoroughly enjoyed our flights from London Ont to Calgary and on to Kelown plane clean much more comfortable than some airlines we have flown long flights on. Staff friendly helpful and great sense of humour. Will fly Westjet whenever we can.

### Jet Airways customer review
Unfortunately the only options for Canadians wishing to go to Hawaii are to stop in a US city and suffer through poor connections and lengthy trips or to use Air Canada and Westjet. For an 8 hour flight using even the premium seats are uncomfortable. The entertainment is non-existent unless you buy a tablet for 17$-which works well if you buy it. For a family of five you are nickle and dimed to death-think 250$ each way for luggage add 100$ for food. Staff are at best evasive and at worst frankly ignore you. Two water offers for a 7 hour flight is lame. The state of Canadian air travel is pathetic and WestJet is the poster boy for extra costs and lacklustre service.

I have traveled Bangkok - London via Mumbai or Delhi several times with Jet with my 11 year old daughter or alone. Bangkok-Mumbai sector seems to be where they send their old planes with seats falling to bits. They often feel overcrowded due to Indian passengers bringing on those huge striped bags bulging with stuff which are about 4 times the 'carry-on' size and don't fit anywhere..but fortunately this is only a short flight. From Mumbai or Delhi to London the planes are always new and pretty well served by the crews. I've had exceptionally good service and pretty poor service on Jet. But the ticket prices are always very good value so I keep coming back. I find the food is generally OK identifiable and edible. And that's about all. The crew don't mind getting extra food and drinks in my experience. Seats are small cramped and uncomfortable for anything over 5 hours. I often wander to the back door area to get the blood in my legs running again and I have found the crew - with the exception of a few rude guys - understanding and obliging. Entertainment on Jet is as most people say not very entertaining. There are a few sitcoms and movies you've seen. I read my kindle and my daughter is locked into her laptop so this is not a problem for us.

### Jet Airways customer review
Flight was delayed flying from Toronto to Vegas. Inflight entertainment screen was broken. Flight 1116 seat 14b. Our return was delayed for 2 hours due to maintenance. We were flying with our 1 yr old and we timed our kid to sleep on most part of our journey. We ended up being stuck in the airport for 4 hours and didn't arrive back in Toronto until 11.30pm. These delays screwed up our plan and created inconvenience for us. I would strongly not recommend this airline.

### Jet Airways customer review
Horrendous return journey from Delhi - over 3 hours on tarmac waiting for an engine fault to be repaired after a flight delay of over an hour. The cabin has the narrowest aisles possible and maximum number of seats. Difficult to move legs or stand up - Capitalism gone mad. All of this after an early morning flight from Nepal resulting in over 24 hours journeying. Never again.

WS2289 from SJD (San Jose del Cabo) to YYC (Calgary) on 19 February 2015. Never let them seat you in row 24! It is smaller than normal no window seats do no recline and are located next to the toilet! On a 4.5 hour flight you have to tolerate bowel movements approximately three hundred times with the accompanying smells when the door opens. A hateful experience to end our holiday.

### Jet Airways customer review
My Jet Airways 9W11 flight from Singapore to Mumbai on 1 Mar 2015 was a regrettable experience. It appeared that they used an aircraft traditionally used on shorter domestic routes on this sector. So leg space (space between rows) on the 5 hour flight was extremely cramped. What really made the flight unacceptable was that they turned off the aircon midway during the flight. It was only after the cabin became unbearable warm passengers were roused from their sleep and a passenger complained the aircon was switched on back - but barely so. The cabin remained uncomfortable. As others note cabin crew were curt - bordering on rude. Jet is now my least preferred airline.

On my way from Montreal to Halifax and Halifax to Montreal I was on crutches due to a knee injury. Staff took very good care of me and made sure I was helped and taken care of at all times. They got me the closest seats to the front and then aisle to make it easier and they got me a wheelchair to get me around the airports on the way back. I was always a fan of WestJet now it's definitely my favorite and according to those around me on this plane I'm not the only one.

### Jet Airways customer review
Booked an Etihad flight from Abu Dhabi to Delhi and landed on a Jet Airways flight. No Business class priority while Boarding or at security. No flat beds only reclining seats (on a night flight). Polite and friendly staff but poor Food and refreshments old cabin and broken facilities (reading light). No inflight entertainment system. On Arrival baggage had been offloaded to make way for freight and only turned up 48 hours later. I had to go to the Airport to collect it no delivery. Conclusion: will never fly Jet Airways again!

### Jet Airways customer review
Westjet may be fine for a very short flight. But to Hawaii forget it. Always late. Terrible service. Very uncomfortable. The staff are grumpy and spend most of their time in the galley eating and gossiping. Very disappointing.

### Jet Airways customer review
I have never met a group of cabin crew so unwilling to help passengers. I though I was unlucky on my flight from London to Mumbai but the crew on the return trip were possibly worse. Clearly passengers are an inconvenience that should just go to sleep and not bother the crew. I was refused a coffee as we were an hour from landing (even though they still hadn't finished clearing from breakfast so it should have been a simple ask). Another major annoyance were the tannoy announcements all through the night telling us we were entering turbulence so should fasten our seatbelts. Most humane airlines mention at the start of a night flight that passengers should keep their belt visible so that they don't have to wake us. There were only 15 movies on offer of which only 2 or 3 are new releases. I won't go into details on the food I handed it back and got extra bread instead (though the guy was reluctant to even provide this). Hopefully never again.

### Jet Airways customer review
Unfortunately Jet Airways appears to have caught the Air India disease and is now offering quite a 'below par' service. The cabin crew are not attentive and a smile is seen as a bonus the whole thing seems to be a cattle truck these days. Our flight was delayed (these things happen) but there is little in the way of welcome when boarding and the crew clearly don't want to be there just simply going their motions. The headphones were broken both outbound and inbound tea and coffee unavailable inbound soft drinks well what can I say self service with a disinterested crew. Inflight was very disappointing to say the least some of the lowest quality I have come across in my travels. Drinks were simply rushed through and on 2 occasions had the cup and/or tray taken from my wife even though she was still eating! Not once but 2 times the reason was simple they wanted to rush through and get the job done for their benefit and not the customer. Overall the crew were unprofessional and left numerous blinds down during landing and were even walking around the cabin with the seat belt signs on! I doubt that conforms with their operations practices. This was a good airline but now seems to behave as if they're doing the customer a big favour.

### Jet Airways customer review
BKK-DEL in Business Class. The worst flight experience we have had in many years and I was literally speechless. My wife and I was traveling with our 6 month old baby and upon boarding the aircraft in DEL we were miserably greeted by the not so interested jet airways air stewards and were not even looked at when trying to settle into our seats. There was no space in the overheads and the crew could see we were struggling but none of them lent a helping hand - totally unacceptable in any class of travel. The seats in business class are awful and something from 20 years ago with virtually zero recline. Food was served in large portions and was just ok. The aircraft is small (737) and there are only 12 business class seats in the formation of 2-2. Just a very awful experience all the way through and we tried to call to get a refund for out return but this was not possible. Avoid this airline and go with Thai or even Air India if travelling this route.

December 29 2014 three adult members of my family flew Economy from Toronto to Bangalore with stops in Brussels and Delhi and then onto Kochi. We flew back on January 9 2015 the same route. Flying 15.5 hours from Toronto to Delhi and back was a torture primarily due to: 1) Worn out seats with hardly any cushion 2) no hot water in toilets 3) filthy floor in toilets 4) toilet tissue running out on two flights with no one paying attention 5) poor quality of food and worst of all 6) waiting nearly two hours in Toronto upon our return for the luggage to arrive. More than half of the flight staff was courteous. We took altogether 8 flights with Jet Airways internationally and within India and none departed on time. At least on two International flights the seats were so stuck trying to get them to recline was a challenge. Although the entertainment selection was pretty good the headphones given out had gone through hardly any quality control; one of them was dead and another with its cable coming off. During the stop over in Brussels both time the passengers got out stood in long queue simply to go through a security check by extremely rude airport staff with no time to freshen up read: washing our face with warm water! It seemed no one controlled the temperature in the planes during flight at times it got too cold and then too warm. Over all we decided unanimously never to fly Jet Airways again.

Flew in from Mumbai to Dubai. So essentially a short flight (3hrs). Crew were polite and sincere. Food was fresh and flavorful. Aircraft was of an older pedigree and seats were average. Entertainment system had options but Probably not enough for a long distance flight. Headphones weren't of a great quality (bring your own). Overall I was happy since food and the crew were great. Was good value for money as well. I wouldn't hesitate to fly them again.

I want to commend Jet Airways for their service on a recent flight. A group of 5 of us were travelling from Delhi Flights between Heathrow / Deli - Mumbai / Heathrow. Whole 10 hour flight one very small bottle of water offered with a meal. Food Issue - staff passed by without offering drinks. Had to ask for tea / coffee with the meal that was offered. Poor quality service all round.

Flew Mumbai to Bhopal in December. Flight out on Christmas Eve and the airport was busy. Had done a web check in and staying in the web check in line for our bag drop off. Rude jet airways staff told us it was not for web check in but for a delayed Delhi flight only. We were not served and had to move to another line. Following that flight was fine and staff were polite. Food onboard was awful. Dry snack like roll. Rather buy food on board than have terrible free food. Return check in at Bhopal was great.

### Jet Airways customer review
Westjet was a very pleasant experience until very recently. The airline started charging for carry-on bags which ultimately has everyone scrambling to find available overhead bin space to stuff their luggage. Longest and most painful boarding I've ever seen - leading to most flights being delayed (delayed over 30+ minutes every time I fly with them). I can't blame this on the crew which keeps a smile on even though they are clearly annoyed with becoming baggage handlers instead of actually providing customer service and focusing on safety. I have no problem with Westjet offering a fee-for-service low-cost model however the prices should be reflective of that. Currently they are literally on par with Porter/Air Canada but with awful in-flight personal entertainment system and an ageing fleet. I would recommend flying Westjet only if it is significantly the cheapest option that you have.

### Jet Airways customer review
YYC to YVR - Cancelled multiple flights on 02/16/2015 with no explanation. Then 600 people flooded customer service to rebook so everyone was stuck in that line up for multiple hours while WestJet only put 4 people behind the kiosks to help. After multiple hours with no updates being given out to the lines people standing in them - the desk offered $15 food voucher and a flight the next day at 11am - clearly not looking at my itinerary as my return flight left YVR that morning at 10am - Competency level = 0. Call center not helpful - managed to rebook me only 8 hours later than original flight so I had to cancel entirely due to an event I was hosting in YVR w/ over 60 participants. Highly suggest not flying WJ for various reasons.

### Jet Airways customer review
Flew Tampa - Toronto in early February. I have flown WestJet regularly and can honestly report that I have never had anything but positive experiences. I normally fly the 'plus' class so the extra space and f&b service is always welcome and commonly I have a free row or at the very least an empty middle seat. Flight crew always warm and friendly. On this particular flight the Captain made a pre-departure announcement at the front of the cabin a nice touch. No satellite TV while in the continental US but the free feature films are more than adequate. With the poor experience many are having with Air Canada and in particular Rouge WestJet is well positioned to be the default go to Canadian product although admittedly I will often use US airlines based out of Buffalo for logistics and pricing advantages.

Flew YEG-YLW and YEG-YYZ. For a discount airlines you get what you pay for. The food is mediocre and same with the entertainment. However I have never had any issues with this airline. The flight crew were amazing and very formal yet casual they try to be professional yet fun at the same time. All in all I'd recommend this airline they are very accommodating.

I want to commend Jet Airways for their service on a recent flight. A group of 5 of us were travelling from Delhi to Kochi via Bangalore. Our flight was late arriving in Bangalore (landing at the time our connecting flight was due to depart). We were unloaded onto the tarmac (not at a gate). The ground staff immediately directed us to a waiting special bus organised to move the 5 of us to the connecting flight. We jumped on the bus and then a few moments later the ground staff came up with our luggage. Within 10 minutes of landing at Bangalore we were on the connecting flight (with our luggage!) and taxiing for take off. It was simply outstanding service and I congratulate Jet Airways!

My husband and I travelled to Cancun on January 3 2015 to January 13 2015 we were treated very well! A wheelchair was provided to and from the aircraft we were given special care which was greatly appreciated!

Flew Westjet a couple of times last year: YYZ-YEG and YYZ-YVR (return flights). I selected the Plus section over the regular economy and the modest extra cost was worth it for the additional value. The seat pitch is better than the back of the plane and all the usual nickel and dime extras are free (checked bags seat selection food). By the time you add up all the extras you would be hit with you can actually come out ahead. Throw in priority boarding and you get a much better experience than regular economy. I had occasion to compare this service with AC Rouge Premium YYZ-MCO and I have to say that Rouge was far better in terms of meals and to some extent service. The cost premium for Rouge however was far higher than the Westjet Plus so I guess you get what you pay for. For longer flights within Canada Westjet Plus will be my preferred option especially when compared to AC's J class which is prohibitively expensive.

LHR to BKK via Mumbai return. Good experience on all legs. Staff seemed slightly more attentive on outward trip but differences were minor. All flights on time lie flats bed comfortable food good and enjoyed the wine selection. IFE did not carry a particularly large selection of latest movies (unless Bollywood) and overall options of classics not great. No seat entertainment on Mumbai to Bangkok leg and seating slightly dated although comfortable. Good value for business class compared with other airlines and only a slight inconvenience going via India. Also arrival at LHR quickest ever and through terminal with bags in just over 10 minutes. Would certainly use again without hesitation.

Jan 12-19 YVR-CUN-YVR. Paid a little extra for emergency row seating well worth the extra few dollars. I travel a lot and I cannot remember having had better fight attendants.

### Jet Airways customer review
Took a total of six round trips with Westjet last year between Calgary and Abbotsford Vancouver and Ottawa. For an airline that promotes itself as the cheap and cheerful alternative to Air Canada it's no longer much of either anymore. Morning flights usually managed to arrive on time but afternoon flights were uniformly late. Cabin and ground service varied from enthusiastic to completely disinterested and disengaged. In-flight entertainment ranged from non-existent to broken. Fares were comparable to AC and the only reason I chose Westjet was because their flight times suited my particular schedules. It seems Westjet is trading on the good will it engendered in their early years. They seem to have run out of steam and are now content to wallow in mediocrity. Better fares and better service used to be their hallmark but there are no longer any reasons to choose them over Air Canada.

YWG-YYZ-CCC-YYZ-YWG booked on WestJet Vacations. Check-in was smooth boarding efficient at all airports. Any delays at Pearson and Cayo Coco were within reason. Temperature was comfortable given all locations travelled. Staff was friendly and professional and added to the experience. Snack and drink were good on all legs. As a larger person I found leg room shoulder room and personal space sufficient even with the seat in front of me reclined. Seats were comfortable and IFE was available on all flights except YYZ-CCC as it was a new plane geared towards wifi and charging units for tablets or other devices. As a side note I was told this about the new fleet when I flew in March but I understand these things take time to be implemented properly. I flew WestJet over the past two years over the competition and make it a point to book with them and participate in their rewards program as I feel WestJet provides a better experience overall. I look forward to my next trip at the end of March!

Was travelling to Amsterdam from Cochin on 3rd Jan 2015. One leg of the flight was with Jet Airways. The flight was delayed due to fog and the KLM connecting flight left. There was no Jet airways representative at the airport to resolve our travel problems. The travel desk required Jet airways to authorize the rebooking since they caused the delay. The local representative arrived after 6 hours. The arrangements were so poor at Abu Dhabi airport that there were hundreds of passengers who had missed the flight due to Jet airways from various destinations were left without any help for many hours. I managed to get my tickets sorted after being in a queue for 8 hours. I have never had such a bad experience in 15 years of flying. They should not be flying international routes as the quality of backup is very poor and no one at Abu Dhabi was taking any responsibility of sorting the passengers problems for many hours.

Phoenix to Toronto and back for Christmas. Fabulous! The schedule was great and the staff are above reproach Yes the "entertainment" is poor (I'm not paying to watch a movie!) but having read the reviews I knew that and brought a book. I expect I will fly with them again. I usually use Air Canada since they're the only other airline that flies that route non-stop but they are not worth the extra cost in my opinion.

CJB to CCU via MAA and BOM late December 2014. The schedule was changed at least half a dozen times during the course of the year. CJB to MAA was on an ATR72 that included a complimentary meal as part of the rebranding exercise. MAA to BOM and BOM to CCU operated by B737 variants with the second leg departing almost 75 minutes late but landing only 30 minutes behind schedule. Emergency row seats made it a pleasant journey despite the negligible delay. Jet Airways continues to be reliable within India.

YYZ-GCM-YYZ Dec 21-Jan 4. Premium Economy. Westjet's flight to GCM is an easy way to get from Toronto to a beautiful Caribbean destination in not much more time than it takes to fly to Florida. GCM airport is bursting at the seams this time of year Westjet's flight arrives just after several U.S. arrivals so you are at the end of the customs line going in and it leaves just after these flights have reloaded so the departure lounge is full when you go back through security. But getting to the airport early to check in 2 hours before flight time and then taking lots of time at the open air restaurant on the second floor before hitting the now shorter security line after the U.S. bound pax have moved through works OK. I was originally sceptical about Westjet's premium economy service but now use it frequently on longer flights. Basically you pay what you would have paid for the type of service we used to get back when there was still some pleasure to be had inflight. The average passenger now gets a choice between the fully cost driven back of the plane service or something more comfortable at a price level many vacation passengers can reasonably afford something not possible if it is only Business or Economy with nothing in between. One final comment is necessary about travel to holiday destinations at peak times of the year. I like an aisle seat my wife likes a window seat nobody likes the middle. So I book D she books F and we take a chance on who will be in E as someone will certainly be on a busy flight. Usually not a problem but who should race into the plane just as the door was shutting but the dreaded 30 something male holiday oaf who spends his last day on the island or the mountain or wherever following his extreme sport passion getting to airport just in time to catch the flight but not in time to have a shower change his shirt or give himself a wash. We got him along with his desire to tell us about his great day. I had to move to E to shield my wife from this character Even the best made travel plans are no match for the some of the thoughtless dolts out and about in vacation land.

We flew from St. John's to Toronto on January 6th and from there on to Tampa. Both flights were very comfortable and the flight crew were friendly and efficient. The Captain was able to get airborne in St. John's in very strong winds with minimal turbulence. Our problem occurred in Toronto with the transfer of our luggage to the connecting flight to Tampa. The conveyer system that brings the luggage to the transfer site was broken and all the connecting luggage had to be moved manually. There was a long wait due to the fact that only two porters had been assigned to this task. They were diligent but obviously stressed by the demands. We were able to catch our flight (it was delayed by WestJet) and much thanks to the lady working in the luggage transfer area who did quite the job of multi-tasking. I acknowledge this is not a direct WestJet problem but a problem for Pearson International. It does not help that we were told this problem has existed for weeks. Surely Pearson can repair a conveyer belt in rapid order. If not please add more porters.

Brussels to New Delhi on 31.12.2014. The crew not good. Whenever I tried to call the crew for help they just turned off the signal and never came. As I travelled with two children I needed it wasn't possible to always go to the galley. Many passengers were facing the same problem. I had a good experience with them during my domestic flights. This is first time I travelled with them outside of India and wouldn't consider it again.

I have already commented on my recent return flights to Kolkata. First class to London-Mumbai-London and Mumbai- Kolkata-Mumbai all by Jet. The service I received in flight and on the ground was excellent. Having travelled worldwide for many years I am able to say that Jet Airways is the best airline that I have used. I have no hesitation in recommending it's use.

Mangalore (IXE) to Mumbai (BOM) flight 9W432 15:10 hours Wednesday 31 December 2014. I travelled with my parents. The check-in process was uneventful and the ground staff was very amiable. Boarding was quite chaotic. Though it was announced that boarding would be sequential this was completely ignored. There were multiple queues converging into one and the ground staff had to literally plead to people to form a single queue. The greeting by the crew was pleasant and it was not long before all were seated and the plane started taxiing. 20 minutes into the journey and the cabin crew wheeled in the food trolleys. Being a late noon flight we were served a warm roll (choice of paneer or chicken) a chocolate a tamarind sweet and a small bottle of water. I opted for the chicken roll which was tasty but quite dry. The service was very irregular and uneven. My aisle co-passenger received his food tray 5 minutes before mine. Within 10 minutes the crew returned to collect the trays. I was still eating my chicken roll and so the cabin crew member asked me to keep the chocolate and water and return the tray to him. Talk about a mad rush! Then they started serving tea and coffee again very randomly. My row was conveniently missed out. When I later asked for tea they politely refused saying that it was time for landing. In all the cabin crew seemed quite inexperienced. Here's hoping for a better in-flight experience the next time I fly with Jet.

### Jet Airways customer review
WestJet has successfully made it to just another airline destroying all of the credibility they once had. Overpriced add-on charges galore smallest carry on size luggage allowance in North America many delayed flights fuel surcharge still after price of oil has fallen 50% a terrible rewards system including tiers now and terrible unreliable in flight entertainment. They keep wanting to fly further and further and the further they fly the worse the service and comfort for passengers get. So all of this means they are making more and more money on their bottom line so buy their stock for now but buy your seat on another airline.

### Jet Airways customer review
Another great Westjet trip direct to Cancun from Calgary and a return flight as well two weeks later. Staff were friendly and professional on both flights. We were in the Plus seats and enjoyed the extra legroom sandwiches and proximity to washrooms. Did not like the hard seats less and less padding every time. The movie selection was poor the same 4-5 movies repeated on both flights.

### Jet Airways customer review
I flew YYZ-YVR on 22 December 2014. Slight delay departing Toronto as cabin crew did not show up on time. As this was one of WestJet's newer Boeing 737-800 there were no personal TV screens on the back of the seats. Instead WestJet rented Samsung Galaxy tablets for $5 + tax to anyone seeking inflight entertainment. The Tablets and the headphones that came with it were horrible - I was unable to hear what was happening in the movie. In order to properly view the movie one had to hold the tablet in front of one's eyes for 3 hours - my hands became quite tired after a while. The selections of available movies and TV shows were extremely limited and dismal. No hot meals available for purchase - only a choice of ham/cheese croissant or turkey sandwich for $7 + tax each. Flight crew took over 2 hours to serve beverages and sell sandwiches. Flying WestJet was an atrocious nightmare for me - I get the same level of service I would flying Ryanair Easyjet or another budget airline but I pay 3-4 times what the budget airlines charge. Utterly shameful!

YYZ-CUN-YYZ on a (NEW) 737-800. Clean comfy seats. The plane was cold though (my feet froze). They have no TV seatbacks but you can rent a tablet for $5. (if you have a credit card). Just another way to make more money. NOT impressed. The staff was pleasant. Plane left on time going to Cancun. The return was 30 minutes late due to crowded/disorganized airport. I will still fly WJ but would like to be on an older plane that has TVs.

YYZ-YEG. Full flight left on time and arrived 20 minutes early due to light headwinds. Courteous staff on ground and in air. Basic transportation with no frills. Unlike previous WestJet experiences nothing to complain about.

### Jet Airways customer review
We travel WestJet often from Vancouver to Toronto and then Barbados. Lately we have a major complaint with booking our flights. There is no indication whether the flight is direct or has stops. If the price is reduced because there is a stopover fine but let us know. It will then be our choice to decide if the reduced price is more important than our time. An extra hour added to an already long trip may not seem like much but to very tired customers who were not informed before booking the tickets it is very annoying. We like WestJet and it is convenient in Terminal 3 in Toronto for the overnight stop at the hotel but we seriously looking at the competition for our next trip. We make this trip a minimum of three times a year.

YYZ-YUL-YYL day return on 737-600 both ways. Very pleasant; on time flights to Montreal and back. Did not pre- book exit row but was able to reserve by checking in right at +24 hours for both flights. First time on WestJet and service was very much a la Southwest Airlines - friendly FAs although limited announcements from the flight deck. Will definitely consider in future as an alternative airline to Air Canada for short-haul domestic/US flights. IFE was okay with live TV available but the setup is now definitely dated with small screens and old armchair controls. If booking Emerg. Exit row 10 on the 737-600 do try to get the ABC side of the aircraft as the DEF side has no overhead bin space available due to emergency equipment.

### Jet Airways customer review
Flew from YVR to Maui. I've always made the choice to travel with Westjet when fares have been comparable with AC. In this case it was the wrong choice. The inflight entertainment for a 6 hour flight was a limited selection of movies on a tablet you need to pay extra for. For kids there was really only one film they would be interested in and even that my kids got bored of. I'm sure there are executives at Westjet patting themselves on the back for the resounding success of the tablet service but really it's just a sign of desperation from their once loyal customers to find anything to do on a 6 hour flight. The other option they give you is a seat back pocket filled with rag magazines. We also made the effort to take 2 checked bags for a family of 4 but now with their check bag fee they're incentivizing us to each carry as much as we can a carry on. The only positive part of our flight was that they were on time both ways. With the line of service between AC and WJ being more blurred the folks running WJ are sadly sending their customers to seek other travel alternatives.

My husband and I flew WestJet from Toronto to FLL on Thursday December 4. We were upgraded to plus seats with lots of leg room and complimentary refreshments. The flight was comfortable and on time. The return flight on Tuesday December 9 was also on time. Flight attendants were polite efficient and very engaging. This was our first WestJet flight and we would definitely fly with them again.

The last year of flying not one flight has not had a delay. The last one I landed in Vancouver and my connecting flight to Victoria was still on the ground at the terminal. All connecting passengers were instructed to go to gate B # and I was handed a ticket for the next flight 3 hours later. That flight was half full and it waited for 25 minutes for an additional 5 people! The flight from Edmonton was delayed 1.5 hours with no explanation but when the plane arrived the bridge to unload passengers was frozen and could not be used. This frozen bridge was out front and centre from Westjet blaming Edmonton Airport Authority that this was the cause of the connecting flights being missed.

I flew with Jet for the first time last week - Paris to Mumbai - as part of a booking with Air France. Never heard of them so looked them up and found this site with some uncomplimentary comments. My expectations were set low but having flown Business Class with KLM AF BA Thai and others I think this is the best one. Wonderful service great food comfortable seat. Could improve by providing a glass of Champagne before take-off and better range of entertainment but everything else excellent and reasonably priced. Perhaps add premium economy seating?

YYZ-YWG-YYZ WestJet is known for its easy going/joking atmosphere. But these things do not replace punctuality and reliability. Flight to YWG packed tense making the crew's jocularity annoying. The desk clerk told us that she was "saving us money" by charging us 56 dollars to check our bag. YWG back to YYZ was late to depart and late to arrive We waited some considerable time to dock at YYZ as West Jet had no staff to do it. The cabin was stiflingly hot and a passenger was using his cell phone while in the air. Of course we were quite late in getting luggage and our bags looked ten years older when they finally arrived. Fewer jokes and better service is what we wanted.

My daughter and I have just returned from a trip to New York flying through Toronto. Flight to New York from Toronto cancelled half hour before departure. Took forever to be rebooked but have to say one of the attendants at the desk was great. Returning home - get to LaGuardia - our flight to Toronto has been cancelled - takes forever to be rebooked for flight leaving three hours later. Flight delayed - no explanation given. Means our earlier flight home to Edmonton has also been rebooked. Get to Toronto - 2200hr flight has been delayed - finally get into the air after midnight. Ridiculous - no one cares - no explanations. So disappointed in WestJet. Service has declined greatly.

I continue to be impressed by this airline. I travelled with them last year for my vacation to and from Tampa Florida. I chose them again this year from Ottawa to Fort Lauderdale direct/non stop. The convenience of clearing US customs in Ottawa is worth it's weight in cash. I refuse to anymore to stress myself out by doing the hysterical rush through Toronto or Montreal to pick up baggage clear US customs and redeposit baggage and then get to connecting gate. The airlines never give you enough time to do that kind of aerobics. I did that last year for the last time. I was so happy this year to find a direct to Fort Lauderdale the day before my cruise and I booked a Plus seat for barely 100.00 more than the flex fare. That was also worth it for me. Most of all WestJet staff are remarkable. Always upbeat and friendly. WestJet remains my airline of choice from Ottawa.

FLL-YYZ Nov 25. Flight about 35 minutes late departing but not a big deal. Inbound aircraft was late arriving. Staff pleasant. Usual marginal IFE but it's not a long flight. Decent price. Leather seats starting to look a bit tired. Overall not a bad product but not as good as it used to be.

I flew the Mumbai to London sector on jet in First Class. I booked in business class but they overbooked my flight to Mumbai so I got upgraded. The first class suite on the 777 is pretty good although not all good as the suites in emirates Singapore airlines Etihad or American airlines. But overall good. The seat goes to a full 180 degree bed. Very comfortable. The staff is very helpful and have a high service standard. The food tasted good and fresh unlike some airlines first class. Overall its a good ad comfortable first class. Its not as good as others but it is also cheaper and definitely value for money.

I flew from Singapore to London Heathrow via Mumbai. The SIN-BOM sector used to be operated by the airbus A330 which was good since it was value for money and it was a bigger and more comfortable plane. Adding to a reason why you would chose jet over sq. (mainly for the money). But now they use the Boeing 737 which is a relatively small aircraft and very cramped. It was very uncomfortable. The food was ok although unnecessarily flavorfull. The TV had a good selection of movies however extremely inconvenient as the touch screen was very slow and required lots of pressure to select a movie. Overall it was a average flight. However I was very disappointed as I paid for a business class ticket for all my flights (all the way to London and back) but it was oversold so I was put in Economy. With no refunds but oh well its only a 5 hour flight. Luckily my flight from Mumbai to London was still business class. In fact they upgraded me to First class for compensation. But I did want to review the 737 business class product. Jet really needs to make their seats in the 737 more comfortable.

Prince George to Vancouver on Flight WS3282 no issues at all. Second part flight from Vancouver to Las Vegas WS1788. A major delay and staff member onboard was unfriendly with a poor attitude. Third part Las Vegas to Vancouver WS1789. Flight crew on that flight were unfriendly and seemed annoyed when asked questions. We had originally booked and paid more to connect in Vancouver to Flight WS3293 with a 1h 20 min connection so naturally we felt a little rushed but felt this was ample time to connect flights. Upon arriving at the gate it took forever to get all the passengers off. We had asked for a cart to speed things up from the plane but were denied and told to speak with the Westjet desk outside of Customs. We rushed to Customs and were put through very quickly by CBSA. Because of the Customs rules we had to wait for our luggage which took well over 25 minutes to collect. We went to the Westjet connection desk we were told we had been re-booked for a later flight at 2130hrs. When we spoke with a Westjet attendant she couldn't figure out why we were re-booked in the first place without our knowledge as everything landed on time. Flight back to Prince George was fine flight wise. Like the flight down and back no entertainment or offer of entertainment or even a mention of no entertainment.

Flew Vancouver to Honolulu recently on a B737-800 without TV's! Seats were uncomfortable and the lack of TV's on a 6 hour flight is surprising. Westjet now will rent you a tablet if enough are available which I suppose is the next trend for the airlines to get more money out of the customers. Westjet seem to have lost their way and have become like the competition something they vowed would never happen. Time to return to the service-oriented company you were. Would be nice if they enforced the carry on rules.

I recently flew to Las Vegas from Calgary and back by Westjet. Flights were very late in both directions. There was no TVs on either flight. I pre-ordered food for the flight for myself and the person I was travelling with. When the flight attendants came they wanted to know if I wanted to buy anything. I told them I already did and had a copy of the receipt on my phone. The flight attendants were then running around looking for the food. The food was not on the flight. Two attendants told us to pick something else in exchange for when I bought. We picked and the attendant then tried to get me to pay for it again. On their website for pre-ordering food you can contact them by e-mail if there was a problem. I did that oer a week and a half ago and no one replied. I usually fly Air Canada but Westjet advertised a better flight time. Since we were so late the Air Canada flight would have been about the same time and I would not have had to sit in the airport for late flights in both directions.

I returned to Calgary from Phoenix on flight 1495 on November 1. The flight was over an hour late to depart that night a later flight departed to Calgary. In my opinion Westjet combined the 2 flights. The crew did not provide an explanation about the delay. The last 4 times flying with Westjet the flight has been delayed. Time to find another airline that can keep schedules.

If you want a flight with the smallest most uncomfortable seat Westjet is for you. I flew 4 hrs on a Westjet flight in a seat that that had little to no cushion left. My neighbors weren't big people but both encroached on my middle seat quite a bit. The cabin was unbearably hot and the air vents barely put out the slightest puff of air. If I have a choice in flights I will never step foot on a Westjet flight again.

Flew to Vegas on WJ1790 and 1791. The seats were made for smaller size people. The entertainment system was not that impressive. The satellite TV cut out the minute the plane crossed into the US. The inflight service was okay and I was impressed with the fact that the inflight crew didn't sing their campy theme song. I probably wouldn't take them again.

### Jet Airways customer review
Singapore-Delhi 9W017. Not sure where to start our most horrible experience up in the air. This wasn't due to any one-off disappointing event that biased the review but an overall awful treatment one is subjected to once they are locked in the cage for 6 hours. Seats: I am not sure if this airline is even complying with the DGCA regulations for how much space needs to be provided to the passengers. Almost everywhere you could hear passengers complaining of congestion. On top of that seats aren't comfortable. Our international flight was followed by a domestic one (on a different airline) which had much more room than an international flight by Jet airways. Food and Beverages: Food was tasteless. Indian food served on my previous leg (with Qantas) was far better than an Indian airlines serving the same cuisine. My wife didn't even eat it. As for the wine only suggestion I have for you is not to order it. The staff do not understand wines much but that can be overlooked given this was least of a concern on that flight. Ambience: Temperature setting did add to the discomfort it was too warm for me to feel comfortable in the pigeon-hole. This wasn't a 1 hr. short hop flight but a long 6 hr. which can even be hard to bear for a whiskey drunk passenger (pun intended). Advice to Qantas would be to reconsider their code share partnership as one doesn't pay a premium (to Qantas) to fly this bird cage. Connection to India will be a tough call given Air India isn't great either but at least they have new planes.

Booked flights to Kathmandu via Delhi as did my niece - the outbound journey was a nightmare. We are both registered disabled with mobility problems - at Heathrow check-in we were promised 3 seats in order for us to stretch our legs. On both flights we were given 1 seat each rows apart with hardly any leg room. The seatbelt light was kept on most of the 1st long-haul flight so we weren't able to stand or use the toilet for hours at a time. The trip back was a dream the cabin crews were so attentive and on the Delhi to London leg we were both given 4 seats at the back so we could lie down. My advice to anyone with a disability would be to email customer services prior to booking detailing your needs. To anyone else I'd say Jet Airways isn't too bad considering the reasonable price of flights if you're a fussy eater and don't like spicy food take a packed lunch and take a cushion as the seats aren't very comfy.

LHR-BOM and BOM-BKK on 9W119/9W062 on 8th/9th October. Usual ice cream before arrival in BOM always comes as a welcome surprise but despite the 9-hour flight being only half-full cabin crew failed to bring round any drinks apart from the main drink/meal-service passengers were expected to go and fetch their own from the galley. Is Jet now a self-service airline ? Perhaps the cabin-crew might tell us they won't be serving any extra drinks and to come and get our own in future? Gate-allocation for BOM-BKK was changed at least twice from 85A (written on boarding-pass) to 85C (on flight-departure screens) to 85B (eventually found after sitting waiting at the wrong gate for 30 mins) it was a shambles which can only cause passengers worry or even cause them to miss boarding. If this happens again perhaps Jet might actually announce it over the speakers or send staff to alert passengers still waiting at the previously-indicated gates?

As soon as plane landed in Mumbai and still moving fast seat belts were opened and passengers started pulling bags out of the overhead lockers. Staff's reaction was late and not effective. Then pulling shoving and pushing to get out of airplane first window seat passengers elbowing their way past aisle seat passengers chaos reigned. Never again Jet Airways!

### Jet Airways customer review
We flew on one of the first flights offered by WestJet to Dublin. The flight from Halifax to St.John's was not bad but was very basic with hard seats and no legroom. We thought that we would certainly upgrade to a larger plane for the cross Atlantic flight but we shocked when we got back on to the same plane. The fact that we had to re-book our seats for the second leg of the flight certainly led to the impression that we would not be getting back into the dinky seats that we had just left. It was the most miserable overseas flight I have ever had and there was no way either of us could get comfortable. Our video screens did not work and the staff only shrugged. On the return flight we upgraded to the Plus seats at a cost of 65 Euros each ticket. More legroom softer (but still narrow) seats and free but dry sandwiches. Free drinks not worth it since all we wanted was tea and juice. The video screens worked but I had purchased my own earbuds earlier in order to avoid the overpriced ones offered on the plane. A slight improvement but not what you would want in an overseas flight. At least we weren't in pain when we landed unlike the outbound journey. This was our first venture with WestJet. If I have anything to do with it it will be our last. I shall gladly pay a higher price for more comfortable flight. When will airlines realize that the flight itself is a major part of a holiday experience?

Flew into Canada and then returned to the US on Westjet. Both flights were delayed which caused us to miss our shuttle connection on arrival and had to wait three hours at the airport for the next one. I was expecting a standard international type flight and was astounded to find that in seat entertainment had to be paid for and that we were given a teensy packet of sesame sticks and drink only. Considering the high cost of the flights something more should have been standard. Each passenger is forced to watch never ending advertisements on the seat screen if you do not pay for entertainment. Given the delay it would have been good for customer relations to allow free entertainment. I will not choose or recommend Westjet to anyone.

Never flew WestJet but will again. Our flight from Quebec to Toronto to Ft. Myers Florida was great. Staff were friendly seats comfortable and plane was clean.

A friend and I had to go to Kozhikode in April 2014 for my brother's wedding. We came from Dubai and had to take the 11.35 flight from Mumbai to Kozhikode on 8 April 2014. The function was at 18:30 the same evening. We approached the check-in counter well in advance at 9:45 and made to wait for about 20 minutes without being told why. We're then told the flight is overbooked and were asked to wait until 11:00. At 11:00 told that we cannot board the flight because it is overbooked. Overbooking flights is understandable. Most airlines do it. However with Jet Airways we were given a bad alternative considering our situation "compensation" of INR 3000 and told to take the 13:25 flight to Kochi and a 5 hour drive to Kozhikode from there. Not the best option for 2 girls who aren't familiar with the city. And guess what we face the inconvenience and we pay and arrange for all this. We were told that they would approach passengers to find out if anyone is willing to give up their seats. As it turns out this was not true because we had another friend on the same flight who mentioned this situation to passengers who were indeed willing to give up their seats. We were told that we would be assisted by Jet Airways staff at the Kochi airport with the taxi bookings. Didn't happen. While overbooking flights is normal the way Jet Airways handled this situation is unacceptable. At the end of it we had the impression that they did not take us seriously at the Mumbai airport. Very bad service at the Mumbai airport and non-existent service at Kochi airport. Unless I have absolutely no choice I would never choose this airline again.

We went on a one-week vacation to beautiful Samana. Upon arrival to the Ottawa Airport we couldn't check in using my husbands passport due to WestJet making a mistake on his name. A very nice representative helped us at Ottawa airport to check in using my passport. On the flight from Toronto to Samana I ended up in the middle seat besides a drunken passenger who just shut the window blind down and spent the entire trip sleeping and invading my personal space. Those planes are small so having to fight off your little space with another passenger is draining. My husband sitting on the alley chair had half his elbow bumped several times by one of the flight attendants. The plane was smelly but at least it wasn't visibly dirty this time. In-flight food: Their free offerings were the poorest I've had the displeasure of experiencing: tiny glasses of water/soft drink/coffee and just two 14 grams bags of cookies or sesame sticks for a 4 hours flight. I understand this was supposed to be a value flight but it wasn't the least expensive in the bunch when compared with Air Canada offerings. All the above mentioned would have been forgiven and forgotten had it not been for the nightmarish experience we had on our flight back. As stated we were among the first to arrive at Samana airport once there we were given two seats together (window and middle): all nice until we got on the flight. The seats were not reclining and we had not been informed. Once the people in front of us reclined we realized that it was impossible for us to do the same. My husband called the flight attendant thinking there was a way of reclining but she just said it was not possible in a rushed manner as if we were a nuisance. For four hours we had to sit uncomfortably with our knees being constantly banged by the hyper kids sitting in front of us and without any possibility of rest. I do believe that if the airline is going to take away a passengers right to a reclining chair/cabin space they should at least offer some kind of compensation be it in the way of a pillow for their sore-necks or a food voucher. To make things worse the cabin on the flight back to Toronto was extremely dirty. The smell could be catalogued more as a stench. The cherry on top was that our connection to Ottawa was delayed for 30 minutes or more due to WestJet having a flight from Cancun being delayed also so we ended up missing our bus connection at the airport.

Took first Westjet flights at end of August and early September 2014 and from many previous reviews expected the worst. First sector was on a new Boeing 737-800 from Toronto to Cayo Coco in Cuba. There was ample room for the shortish flight service was good and crew were good humoured. Bought wine on board and not over priced for airline. Flight left and landed on time. One week later made return flight this time on Boeing 737 - 700 which was obviously an older plane judging by interior. Again no problem good crew and flight to |Toronto was punctual. For a no frills airline we had no problems with them.

(YVR-YYC: Vancouver to Calgary Boeing 737-700/800) I fly this route for business at least once a month and for me WestJet has slowly started to go down hill within the last 8 months. I have found the customer service WestJet had in the beginning is not there anymore. I usually take the 10am morning flight out of Vancouver and have had no issues in the past. My last flight with them was on September 3rd to the 5th and I was very disappointed. The flight was delayed for more then 2 hours (it happens when you fly a lot no big deal) but my problem was that they didn't keep anyone notified on the status of the flight. On the way back it was even worse. My flight back to Vancouver was supposed to depart around 7:50 but we got delayed for a half hour which turned into 3 hours because of "mechanical" issues. Once again no WestJet staff were there to answer any questions or give us any info on the flights status. We didn't end up departing until ten to midnight. Too many times this has happened the last few months. I can't believe I'm saying this but I think I am going to start using Air Canada and fly on the less cramped Embraer 175.

My sister took the 10.10pm WJ412 flight on Aug 26 from YVR and her flight was delayed 35 mins. Next day my other sister and I took WJ412 at 10.10pm from YVR and again the flight was delayed half an hour. All three of us returned from YEG on Aug 31 on the 4.05pm WJ109 flight - delayed (again) - over 45 mins! We will never fly Westjet again. Part of the delay on Aug 31 was that someone was sitting in our seats - same seat# on Boarding Pass - turns out they had been on the previous flight and no-one bothered to check that they had the next (5pm) connecting flight to YVR and should have got off the plane! They didn't speak much English so it took 15 mins just to get them (4 people) off.

On Tuesday Sept 2 2014 I took the early WestJet flight to Vancouver for work. The plane was very empty but my row Row 4 was full. Once the plane was up in the air and the seat belt signed turned off I moved forward one to row - Row 3 which is a plus row and was completely empty - all six seats. I didn't think there was any chance of picking up more passenger planning to sit in these seats unless they were waiting for us on a cloud somewhere. The Flight Attendant told me that although the row was completely empty I couldn't sit there and needed to find a vacant row at the rear of the plane. I realize there are rules and they need to be enforced but I also think there are times to apply the rules and times to realize there really is no point.

I traveled Jet Airways economy with my husband from Kuwait to Mumbai. We had only two pieces of checked in baggage weighing totally 17 kgs. The flight was very cramped. No foot rest. Keeping the legs down with no support was very uncomfortable. There was no legroom the front seat passenger reclined his seat and it almost hit my face. More bad news awaited us at Mumbai airport. We waited for our luggage only one piece arrived. After waiting for almost 45 minutes we saw that the message displayed last bag. There were many people still waiting but none of our baggage came. When we went to the Jet airways counter they simply said that our luggage had been offloaded due to the plane being overloaded. No compensation offered. We had no option but to give the details of our baggage that was still stuck at Kuwait airport. After all this we had to keep calling customer relations number that was provided regarding our baggage only to be told time and again that it was still in Kuwait and they had no idea when the baggage would arrive.

### Jet Airways customer review
Every week from Victoria to Calgary sick of full flights when they leave late there is no explanation its always a mad rush to get on because they never adhere to rules of boarding by row's. They also never adhere to baggage size anyone can take any size bag and just take up all the room by putting it sideways in the overhead. Fed up seeing the long faces of the staff with the occasional false smile not all their fault because the company is always trying to squeeze every cent of profit. Have travelled with Air Canada on same route they are even worse. Look forward to the day when another company enters the route. The small seats and no leg room are another annoyance looking forward to when the other competition gets in on this route all it takes is another company who are not trying to squeeze quite as much profit not a big ask.

Flight 121 on August 16th. London to Delhi then a domestic flight. Wasn't pleased at all. Entertainment selection was very poor but that didn't concern me much. Seats were okay. Toilets were not as clean and not at all fresh from the very beginning of the flight. Attitude of the crew were as if they wished they didn't have to serve the passengers. Not even once any of them said "welcome" or smiled to my "thank you" which I said out of habit every time any of them served me. Food was tasteless. Coffee was served cold both times. Trays was cleared much later after passengers were done eating. Some had to get out of their seat to go to the washroom and had to go through some "acrobatic" moves to get out of the seat holding up their food tray. Some already fall a sleep before the crew cleared the trays. At breakfast we were served only with a piece of cake and a small serving of fruits and cold coffee. It looked to me there was an empty space on the tray to serve breakfast item but nothing came. I strongly suspect that either they "forgot" to serve it or they were too late to serve the entree so skipped it all together. The time between dinner and breakfast was long on a 8 hours 30 minutes flight. No other snacks / drinks were offered in between. Crew totally ignored the call button and my loud enough "excuse me" more than twice. Horrible terrible customer service. The crew were a disgrace. I am dreading my 9 hours 35 minutes return flight from Mumbai to London on Sunday 1:40am. If I can help it depending on my schedule I might not fly Jet Airways again.

We were in Honolulu when hurricane Iselle arrived so our flight was cancelled due to high winds. I discovered the cancellation by checking online and made subsequent arrangements for a later flight. WJ arranged for an unscheduled earlier flight home so I rebooked on that one. Aside from the usual airport confusion and lack of clear direction we got on our flight ok. I guess the attendant crew were annoyed at having to work they were obviously unhappy and let it show in their cranky demeanor while they performed their "service".

### Jet Airways customer review
I had a horrible flight from Hamilton to Calgary I was seated beside a women who had to have weighed at least 350-400 lbs. She took her seat and half of mine she also refused to allow the arm rest to be put down. I flew all the way squashed into the corner of my seat I could not move. I discreetly asked to be moved to another seat however none were available. At no time did the attendants acknowledge that I was being forcefully wedged into the other armrest even when I was unable to accept a cup of tea as I could not use my arms.

### Jet Airways customer review
Really disappointed on my recent trip Edmonton to Las Vegas! There were no television screens in the seat backs nor any tablets available to rent. No entertainment was provided whatsoever. Apparently Westjet is moving to this business model of making tablets available to rent for $5 each but only on flights of 3 hr + 20 min or longer. Edmonton to Las Vegas is 3 hr. Passengers weren't informed of this condition until 10 minutes prior to boarding! At the very least Westjet should have posted notice of this "discount service" flight online prior to our booking and reduced the price accordingly. Even the smiling joking flight attendants couldn't make up for Westjet's poor judgement. If and when portable tablets are made available for rent here again is another nickle-and-dime scheme from a once reputable airline. New discount airlines can't come soon enough because that's the level of service that we received at Westjet's full-service prices.

### Jet Airways customer review
It was a gruelling long flight from Vancouver to Toronto flight was full and of course no TV movies or music whatsoever. The excuse was its a new aircraft and could not accommodate the system but it was okay to buy the mini screen for your seat at $5 a pop. This should all be included. Price gouging again from WestJet and super- sizing. The staff were friendly bordering on condescending when we all asked to take our seats for most of the flight. 5 hrs is a long time when your fed drinks and food and then told to take a seat since you were not allowed to use the restroom.

### Jet Airways customer review
JFK-YYC return. Check in was very frustrating as the system would not allow me to check in via phone online or on the mobile app thus I wasn't able to select a seat until I got to the airport. Even arriving 2 hours early reps told me only middle seats were left - trouble for me as I'm a 6'3" guy. They cheerfully told me I could "upgrade" to a Plus middle seat for $42. This didn't seem any bigger or more legroom than normal but at least food (which was tasty) was free. Otherwise trip to YYC was in a clean well maintained B737-700 and crew was friendly. Return check-in online worked fine paid $42 to sit in 1F by the bulkhead as I thought it would be a lot more legroom. My mistake. A horrible seat. Crew on this leg were into making lots of jokes on the PA but when it came to service I found them a bit detached. Overall I took this flight because it was direct to Calgary but at almost $800 all in for the ticket and upgrades I'd hardly call it a low-cost carrier. Having satellite TV on the IFE helped though so I guess I'd fly them again for much much cheaper.

### Jet Airways customer review
Calgary to Vancouver. The staff were overly familiar and I didn't feel they approached their job with the seriousness it warrants. I didn't feel that in the event of an emergency that we were in competent hands. Plane was a Boeing 737 and because of the way the seats are built you only get an airline standard under seat stowage if you get a window seat. If you aren't one of the first on the plane you may not find stowage in the overhead bins either. I also found the seats were lacking in leg room and they seemed to be too short and didn't provide enough support under the legs. By the end of the 90 minute flight my legs were cramping. Inflight entertainment system was satellite TV and PPV movies. Complementary non alcoholic bevs and alcohol and food available for purchase.

### Jet Airways customer review
I write this review from YQR one of the smaller airports in Canada. I further write this as one who travels frequently for both work and personal on this occasion with my husband and 2 children. We arrived at the cut off time for a 5.50 am flight. We were channelled into a line up for manual check-in. Note: for some reason I didn't receive the usual check-in notice 24 hours in advance to do online. I tried to do so but it wasn't allowing. We wait in line for manual check-in with one attendant. She continued to help one family for 20 mins (from the time we arrived). They appeared to be moving their lives from A to B. If we were earlier given the circumstance we still would have been notably late for check-in. No other attendant came over to help check people in. Meanwhile several people missed their flight to Calgary. Remember this is Regina SK. Finally our turn I learn that between 11-13 people per flight are randomly selected for manual check in and unable to do e-check-in. Odds are that 1 in our family of 4 was randomly selected which resulted in our inability to e-check-in. OK we accept missing the flight with the script from the attendant "there is nothing we can do. We later find out that a person who was quite far behind us was accommodated and put on the flight. We had breakfast with the family as we wait 4 hours in Regina to catch a different flight. Long story short: rude service upon initial arrival at airport short staffed at manual check-in no responsiveness from walker by attendants to help our family shuffle along while others appeared to be moved along others behind us accommodated. We received the text book verbiage from the attendant and was one of the more phoney/unauthentic explanations I've received. Disappointed beyond words and will do everything to not fly with WestJet. They apparently pride themselves on customer service. This was everything but customer service.

### Jet Airways customer review
Never flying WestJest again. Made it from Toronto to Vancouver fine but connecting flight to Victoria was cancelled due to 'maintenance' issues. WestJet refused to rebook us on an Air Canada flight and worse were out of hotel vouchers in Vancouver so gave us the non-option of flying to Calgary to stay in a hotel for approximately 6 hrs of sleep or leave us on our own to find our own accommodations. Not impressed.

### Jet Airways customer review
Was very worried about travelling with Jet after reading the reviews but was pleasantly surprised. Staff were pleasant food was good plane toilets clean in fact we had four very pleasant flights from London to Mumbai then Mumbai to Sri Lanka and back. Jet was cheaper than the other airlines and proved to be good value for money. All that we want is a pleasant safe journey. I can understand that if you want a choice of food and extra large seats then Jet may not be the airline for you but I would definitely say don't worry about all that you read give them a try and make up your own mind.

DEL-KTM. I have always used Jet Airways whenever possible to adjust in my flight legs. I find their service to be better than other Indian carriers (or international carriers for that matter). Their selection of IFE is huge and diverse. The aircraft is newer than most European/American carriers and thus have more advanced features like larger screens easy navigation/selection etc. The food selection is also nice and include a combination of both regional and international meal options. Finally the group and air crew service attitude and willingness to help stands out. They are courteous and have a good deal of professionals makes you feel you're in good hands. I would fly Jet whenever possible!

Flew LHR-DEL July 2014. Service was awful. Toilets were dirty. Food served was stale and badly presented. Staff were very apologetic but could do nothing and blamed their caterers. When we landed I wanted to complain but the ground staff said there was nothing they could do. Gave me an email address to write to. I duly wrote to them and nothing since not even an acknowledgement. Never again will I fly this airline.

I have been travelling on Westjet for many years now and the definite drop in service reliability and quality is astounding. My last four flights have been delayed with no reasonable explanation as to why (No I am not exaggerating). Yesterday my flight out of Victoria was delayed. When I asked the agent at the counter in Victoria why my last three flights were delayed she was very sarcastic and said I guess you are just unlucky” and turned to chat with another agent! To me that was just an example of Westjets decline in customer service. Imagine my surprise when my connecting flight in Vancouver was also delayed. But it gets better once on the aircraft my seat was full of crumbs the tray was stained with coffee (I paid the 30 dollars for the plus seat) and the entertainment system did not work.

Have been travelling Jet Airways business class London-Mumbai frequently since 2005. This year I have been very disappointed. Dirty toilets with non-functional soap-dispensers toasted sandwich snack served cold! Delay in clearing trays to entrap one down seemingly forever poor announcements in the airport lounge area apathetic cabin crew unilaterally working headphones and the last-straw - allocated seats being occupied by "upgraded" economy class customers.

I was quite sceptical about flying Jet Airways after reading all the negative reviews so I was pleasantly surprised on both legs of my flight Singapore-Delhi-Singapore. The plane was clean seats comfortable food very good and inflight entertainment excellent. The staff were attentive and were there when needed. If this is the standard then I will definitely fly with Jet Airways again.

SIN-Chennai on 19 July 2014 on 9W21. Flying an international route of Jet after 4 years. Flight was on time. Aged aircraft that should not have been flown on an overseas route. Seats cushions were so thin that it felt like sitting on a metal seat. Leg room was totally inadequate for a 4 hour flight. Wonder if seat pitch was just 29". Food was reasonably good but standard of service seems to have gone down in the last 4 years. Jet should definitely fly newer planes with better interiors and seat pitch on international routes.

### Jet Airways customer review
Travelled on Jet from Heathrow to Delhi 3 months back. To be honest I don't know the difference between this airline and the poor standards of Air India. The seats were rock hard and cramped and I had to put a pillow underneath. So uncomfortable. Food was very bland and nothing special. Service was slow. The only good thing were the young pretty girls of Jet Airways.

### Jet Airways customer review
We've been flying Jet Airways for a number of years both international and domestic (India) routes. Staff is friendly and helpful and seem pleased to be of assistance they are certainly not surly like some airline attendants. It is small touches that makes flights on Jet Airways satisfying. Hand lotions in the economy class bathrooms toilets equipped with bidets an extensive selection of vegetarian menus (oriental Jain Hindu vegan etc) art-house and hard-to-find movies on the entertainment system. If Jet Airways was part of Star Alliance it would be one of my first choices.

Flight 146 Victoria to Toronto. Arrived at the airport 35 minutes before my flight. I was told by the customer agent that I had missed the "closure" time of the flight (didn't know it was 45 minutes) and he put me in a separate line to be re-accommodated. All very polite and no problem. My line was getting bigger. I counted 12 people then 17! Eventually I was re-booked via Calgary. My concern is that I found the cut-off times deep in Westjets website. Please make this info more visible or even on the Ticket.

Traveled with them Brussels-Newark-Brussels. Online check-in was not possible service at the check in desk was OK but by the time we boarded one of our seats was broken and did not recline. The flight attendants did nothing to make up for this. After the return flight some luggage was lost and after calling the office at Brussels airport for 2 days I received an email address from them. It has been 2 months and I am still waiting for a reply. I am appalled by the lack of quality in their customer service.

I booked with Delta to go to Vancouver from NYC and back. Was rerouted to Westjet both trips and was more than happy with Westjet service. Admittedly in-flight entertainment system left a lot to be desired but in reality who really enjoys watching movies on tiny screens? The main thing to me is that all 4 legs of the trip were on time the seats were comfortable - okay at only 5 foot tall I don't really need a lot of leg room - the staff were courteous and pleasant and the luggage was delivered intact and speedily. Considering these were short-haul trips Westjet is as good as other airline and even better at keeping to schedules. Another plus is the helpfulness of the ground staff - they were so friendly and approachable. All in all a good experience.

### Jet Airways customer review
Booked a WestJet Vacations package from Toronto to LaGuardia (New York) and paid extra to leave earlier in the day (12.25) on July 2 so we would have more time in NYC. After sitting on the runway for more than 1.5 hours they informed us that no flights were landing in NYC due to Hurricane Arthur we were returned to the gate and told to ask the attendant to move us to another flight. Since the attendant had no idea what was going on she told us to go to the main gate where we waited in line for an hour only to be told that the flight was delayed until 18.40. Later in the afternoon they told us that the flight was delayed further to 20.10. 3 flights worth of passengers were held in the waiting area and no one was offered water or a food voucher. Our flight was finally cancelled at 21.00 and without any shame WestJet handed out business cards with a number to call to rearrange our flights. The line was busy for at least an hour so we left the airport and were left to find our own accommodation for the evening in Toronto. We called WestJet Vacations and were offered the same flight the next day and with the only compensation being that they would arrange to have my friend and I in adjacent seats without a charge. The flight the next day was delayed one hour and there was no TV service available. WestJet made no such effort to do the same. On the return flight we were delayed 1 hour and 5 minutes and again there was no TV service until mid- flight. No recommendation is given based on the non-chalant and casual way that WestJet handled the entire delay on both legs and the colossal mix up with the hotel reservations.

### Jet Airways customer review
Flying from Newcastle to Malaga - great flight. Return journey - paid 59 euros as 4 kilos over on cases (did not buy anything extra that weighed that). Pilot informed us we had missed our slot so we had to wait another 30 minutes. He then informed us that there was no air conditioning another 30 minutes wait - some passengers did receive water from staff but not all - thought we were travelling with Ryanair.

### Jet Airways customer review
I would first mention that I have been a fairly frequent customer of Jet Airways over the last 7 years and generally find the company to be welcoming and efficient. This morning I flew JetKonnect 9W 2348 from LEH to Delhi. JetKonnect appears to be a low-cost arm of Jet Airways though in my opinion it does not seem to be very clearly differentiated from the main company in its marketing. I paid a very high fare for a one-hour flight sector in India. Despite having checked-in on-line the previous day and arriving at the airport 2 hours before the scheduled departure time with a printed boarding pass I had to queue for more than 45 minutes in a poorly managed utterly chaotic check-in area. There was no separate bag drop for already checked-in passengers. On eventually reaching the check-in desk I was told that I was 7 kilos over the 15kg checked-baggage allowance and had to pay an additional INR2000 in excess baggage charges. However I was 1kg under the 7kg cabin baggage allowance. I was invited to transfer 1kg of items from my checked luggage to my cabin baggage in order to save myself 1kg (INR300) excess baggage charge! This was hardly appropriate in the hectic environment and it seemed a nonsense not to combine the checked-baggage and cabin-baggage weight allowance. After all what difference does it make whether the total baggage allowance is carried as cabin or hold baggage? Given the very high fare charged by JetKonnect the hold-baggage allowance of 15kg seemed unreasonably low compared to industry standard of 20kg or 23kg. I was transiting to an international flight on another airline at Delhi airport and my hold-baggage was under-allowance for that flight. In order to complete the excess baggage payment I had to negotiate my way back through the security check-point to the terminal entrance where the Jet Airways ticket desk was located and then repeat the lengthy entry security check to return to the check-in desk. After dropping my checked baggage I proceeded to a long queue at the boarding gate. On eventually reaching the boarding point I was told to go back to a hold-baggage sorting area to identify my bag before it was loaded onto the aircraft. This unusual procedure had not been advised by the check-in agent and I saw numerous other passengers being turned back like myself to complete this task which had not been explained to them. It was therefore no surprise that the departure of the flight was delayed because of hopelessly inefficient ground handling. The flight itself was entirely uneventful but the experience at LEH airport was truly dreadful and judging by the comments of other customers my experience was not isolated.

I pre-ordered my snack ahead of flight and online the snack with cheese cold cuts olives apricots and very thin bread slices did not resemble what was online. I was not happy. The flight attendants did not come around with coffee or tea after we ate and they certainly had time to do so! Not impressed with this flight on #674 departing Calgary at 5.15 pm and headed to Toronto last Thursday. Sure hope the trip home is better.

We flew WJ for the first time in May 2014. I had booked a round-trip between Montreal and Fort Lauderdale. Our Plus seats 2 E/F for the first leg and 3 A/B on the way back. On the way to FLL the entertainment system in our row did not work at all. We did not make an issue of this because neither one of us were going to use it. At 6’3 the seats offer enough room for me to not cramp up but a standard emergency exit offers more. There is no extra shoulder room in these seats. The attendants were and the food/drink was fine. The flight was uneventful. On the way back to Montreal our entertainment system did not initially work and I upset this time because I wanted to watch a movie. I was offered the option to move seats but the system came on and all was well after that. Everything else was the same as the other flight. Given the choice between economy on any or WJ plus I will take the plus for the $40 upcharge.

I flew from Chicago to London (United) and London to Mumbai followed by another trip from Mumbai to Hong Kong and return all the way back. It was my first experience with the airline and was a little nervous as the reviews were not that great. But surprisingly my flights were almost on-time. The food was delicious and satisfying. Alcohol was available whenever needed (a big plus point). The seat was comfortable. The only negative throughout the itinerary was at London Heathrow where there was some chaos but that too was not the airline's fault at all. Things to improve can be probably: the staff could be a little more visible when needed and use of better headphones to go with the great entertainment system. I have traveled on the Mumbai-London route a lot and Jet Airways is definitely up there.

### Jet Airways customer review
I flew YYZ-BRU-YYZ in May and this was my second trip on Jet Airways. I have flown to Europe on KLM BA and Air France so I am comparing my experience with these airlines rather than other Asia carriers. Price - The price to Brussels on Jet Airways was about 20% cheaper than the Business Class fares on the carriers mentioned above that would have met my itinerary requirements. I usually book 2-3 months in advance and keep an eye out for seat sales etc. Lounge - At Pearson Jet Airways is in Terminal 1 and shares the lounge with Air Canada. In Brussels they have their own lounge which caters more to the Indian taste. (Not that I mind I enjoyed chicken wasabi sandwiches). Priority Services - The priority boarding has improved since my last trip in November especially on the Brussels site. I had no trouble accessing the gate agent and boarding the plane. InFlight - The inflight service is very well done the meals tasty a good selection of entertainment and fully flat sears for sleeping with sheets and comforter. Comparison to other carriers - I would say that other than price each one of the other carriers I have flown are better in one respect but not the others. Jet Airways is number 2 in all the categories for me which makes it an all around good experience and is why as long as they are the same price or cheaper I will fly them over the other choices. (BA has the best seat but the worst food the worst airport to transit ok service - Air France has the best food but I don't like the seats KLM usually has the best service but the worst seats).

9W 75 HKG-BOM: They really need to do something about their cabin crew. They had 4 crew serving Economy. The crew were plainly incompetent and not interested. No smiles no greeting no warmth. They were badly groomed. They couldn't bother to serve my VLML meal even though it was listed in their manifest until I had to insist that they search for it. They never came by with a tray of drinks/water for the second time on a 5+ hr flight. They could not be bothered do the pre-flight checks and during take-off and landing. On the plus side the A330-200 cabin was clean leg room was OK not great. Flight was on time and piloting was good.

9W 10 BOM-SIN. First the good news - check-in was quick flight was on time. Next the bad part - they really ought to stop flying a 737-800 for 6 hours on this route. Seats were cramped entertainment was poor and the cabin crew though friendly were pathetic. They did not have the VLML meal that I had pre-ordered and confirmed with them twice before the flight. They forgot to serve the bread with the meal and one lady came by sheepishly with it after people had finished eating. Clearly their cabin crew training standards are dubious so is their catering.

My wife and I traveled from YYC to YYZ on a trip to house hunt and visit friends. First issue was the flight out we had a 20 minute delay due to issues with the plane of course I'm glad they noticed the fuel leak before taking off but at least they could have done something to keep the over heated boring wait a little more enjoyable like hand out free headsets. I'm sure the $1200 for the return flight should cover a $3 (Cost price) headset also on the first flight the TV was jacked and flickering so watching any channel was a waste of time. Flight was "Sold out" so I could not change seats. Second issue was on the return flight. Is it ok for a father to encourage their child to scream and shout? I along with everyone in the 6 row radius heard these screaming kids after explaining to the father I don't want to hear your stories I just want a quiet flight back to YYC. I spoke to the stewardess and she just laughed and explained that she couldn't do anything. This was so bad and I had been told by friends who flew WestJet that there not good but I like to judge myself - judgement made.

9W 121 London to Delhi. Flight was scheduled to depart at 8.45 pm on June 30th but took off at 6pm on July 1. I travelled on the Delhi-London-Delhi sector and was shocked at the poor service provided by Jet Airways. The flight was over booked and late. Then finally we all boarded (there was no signage for where to board for the economy class passengers) amidst some confusion. The Captain then announced that there was a technical error and it would soon be fixed. This continued for over four hours until we were finally deplaned at 1 am. In this interim we were served dinner. The crew was not available or responding to any call bells for water etc. They just kept ignoring all passengers even the elderly and those with children. After we were deplaned the nightmare continued. It took two hours for the ground staff to arrange hotel accommodation and in the interim they refused to tell us which hotels etc. We were expected to empathise with them! Clearly they were unprepared and had not thought ahead to plan for such a situation. We lost a night and a full working day as well. Terrible experience and the worst was the attitude of Jet Airways.

We took our first flight with WestJet this year from Toronto to Vancouver and back. On the way to Vancouver we had plus seats. Well that was ok for me as I'm not a very big person however it was not much of a *plus* for my husband who is not as small as I am. However on our return trip we arrived at the airport and found our trip had been cancelled. The reason "due to a fire drill at the hotel our crew was at they did not acquire the proper amount of sleep". Keep in mind our flight out of Vancouver was for 3.50pm. They were unable to put us on any other flight and set us to fly out of Vancouver at 10.45pm and not arriving in Toronto until 6.07am the following day. We were given two vouchers from WestJet for $30 each to make up for the inconvenience of our journey. We will never fly WestJet again.

Victoria-Toronto-Halifax (21/5/2014) and return (27/5/2014). About eight hours overall travel time each way all four legs with B737-700 aircraft. Flights on time luggage delivered promptly cheerful and hard-working FAs throughout making several water runs. The only negative aspect of WestJet is the lame unprofessional attempt to inject humour into the in-flight announcements. AV doesn't offer much but that doesn't matter because I always bring my own reading material. Didn't purchase on-board food items. (As most Canadians do for domestic flights I bought things from a sandwich counter near the departure gate just before boarding.) I used to take transcontinental trips of this kind with Air Canada but more and more AC flights are being downgraded to the AC Rouge division. With WestJet you don't run that risk and WestJet's fares are no higher.

Flew YOW to YYZ on 1st July my first flight on WestJet. Wild takeoff seems we hit 35000 feet in half the normal time. Small snack but it was a 40 min flight and I wasn't expecting anything. The two flight attendants were a bit childish in their demeanour but otherwise friendly and professional. Nothing here to stop me flying WestJet again on my next visit to Canada.

Flew with Jet Airways this week Brussels to Newark. Although we had a good experience five years ago on the same leg their service has substantially deteriorated over time. Rude unresponsive flight attendants who could not care less about passengers poor to indecent meal quality chaotic seat allocation (we were a family of 4 and we were scattered all across the A330 online check in the day before departure did not let us reserve seats saying "no seating available"). Unhelpful staff at Brussels airport. To sum it up extremely disappointed. Would not fly Jet Airways again and would certainly not recommend.

I boarded the Jet flight from Delhi to Heathrow at 1pm. The take off was scheduled for 1.45 but we were informed that there would be a short delay due to a technical glitch. The delay stretched on and we sat on the tarmac until close to 2.45 with no further information. Some lucky passengers got drinks (many did not) and no food was served. Then we were informed that the technical glitch would take several hours and that we would be deplaned. It took another half hour to get us off the plane and then complete chaos reigned. There were no instructions on what to do next or where to go. There were 2-3 Jet ground staff members surrounded by knots of increasingly angry passengers demanding guidance. The Jet ground staff appeared totally clueless on how to handle the situation. One staff member said we would get new boarding passes (not clear where) while another said that the Delhi based folks should go home and come back at 11 for a 2.15 flight. There were many passengers who were from outside Delhi or who were tourists/visitors who had checked out of their hotels - they were told that hotels would be arranged. There was no protocol no clear communication - utter chaos. It went on this way all the way to the airport exit - when I left at 5PM there were still several passengers (including elderly folks) waiting for a coach to take them to a nearby hotel. I have noticed a sharp fall in the service quality at Jet - the staff used to be friendly and competent about 10 years ago but have become brusque dismissive and unpleasant besides increasingly incompetent in recent years. Awful experience.

17th June 2014 at 16.50 flight WS533 Halifax to Hamilton. Flew from Halifax NS to Hamilton on the 17th June and pilot was able to land in the storm where a Tornado hit Barrie earlier. He had to abort the first try and it was very scary. Commendation to the pilot and crew very professional all passengers breathed a sigh of relief and clapped when we got down in one piece. Would recommend this airline.

Pearson - LaGuardia: Waited 7 hours at LaGuardia after first flight was cancelled with absolutely no information from Westjet. The staff (frustrated with customers) turn the TV off and walked away from the gate. It would have been nice to have been given information about something like the AA and other flights at the other gates in the area. The staff were also very unfriendly anytime approached.

Recently traveled YWG-LAS via YYC. Flights left on time and overall flight was ok. I have to say the joking manner in which the flight attendants have is something to be desired. Why can't they just act professionally and be friendly? I was seated in the Plus section extra leg room is nice free liquor and snacks but seat width or pitch is no more. I traveled the last leg in a standard seat and I must say it's not too pleasant. Overall was satisfied but would take the competition over WJ any day.

Sitting in YVR waiting for flight 245 to YYC. Flight has been delayed for over 2 hours due to "technical difficulties" with the plane. So how did they apologize for the inconvenience? A $10 meal voucher. There are at least 2 other Westjet flights departing for Calgary before our rescheduled flight time however the airline is refusing to transfer any of the passengers to other flights because "it would take too much time to re-tag luggage". Westjet used to be a fabulous airline years ago however their quality of service in-flight entertainment and in-flight comfort have declined considerably. Air Canada is much better.

### Jet Airways customer review
Six flights. Bangkok to Mumbai to Kolkata to Bagdogra returned two weeks later. I had first booked a direct flight from Bangkok to Kolkata but two weeks later Jet Airways made a schedule change and simply emailed me to tell me that the Bangkok - Kolkata flights were cancelled with no information about where I stand in regards refunds and rebooking. However I phoned a phone number here in New Zealand and the consultant worked hard to come up with a suitable alternative for me which meant longer flights and less sleep but ensured that I got to where I needed to be and charged me no extra. I got the feeling that running on time was very important to the airline one leg was 10 minutes late and it was made clear to us that it was due to a late inbound aircraft due to congested air traffic (ie: not Jet Airways' fault). They hurried us through boarding so that time could be made up. Food and staff were fine check-in staff very helpful and friendly. Ironically at the slightest bump in the sky seat-belt sign was on and we were told to remain in our seats yet prior to take-off staff didn't come and check seat-belts and also a passenger two seats over from me was busy talking on her phone during take-off and staff didn't address this even though the safety briefing had been very clear. There was no in-flight entertainment on the planes I took and the seats didn't recline but good service otherwise.

HNL to YVR flight # 1865 departing 10.18 pm June 5th. I hurt my leg and could hardly walk. I had trouble bending my leg. When checking in I asked if there were any empty seats. I was told there were 9. I asked if I could please be seated in a row with an empty seat so I could be in less pain I was told yes and got my boarding pass. When I got to my seat I found my row full and I was crammed in where I could not use my cane and I was in pain. I asked the stewardess if she could help find me a better place to sit. She told me that although there were empty seats throughout the plane there was nothing she could do for me. I spent the next 6 hours in agony. This is the first time I had ever requested this kind of consideration and I am extremely upset that no effort was made to help me. This flight crew seemed tired and in a hurry to have the flight over with. I have been a frequent flyer with Westjet I am going to find another carrier. I do not think I will fly with Westjet again.

I was supposed to fly on flight 9W117 from LHR to HYD via Mumbai. The flight was cancelled due to technical problems with the aircraft. Such things are entirely understandable. But right from the way this information was delivered to the way the 300+ dislodged passengers were handled was simply appalling. Those with kids and the elderly were not looked after well. Those who kicked up a lot of fuss were given seats in the next flight. After waiting for 4 hrs on a queue I have been re-routed with BA and I will be attending the conference two days late with having to request a reschedule of my talk. My bag was not given back to me! The treatment I have received so far by the BA staff is simply excellent. Never again Jet Airways!

Flew Vancouver-Edmonton and return. Flights left on time or within 15 minutes of scheduled departure time. Flight attendants were pleasant. Seats were comfortable enough for 1.5 hour flight although they could be better. Did not appreciate the need to pay to watch movies. Bring your own earphones to access the inflight entertainment. Return trip from Edmonton-Vancouver was in Economy plus. The extra inches of legroom are worth it and one gets complimentary alcoholic beverages and snacks. Westjet is good but cannot compare with the 5 star Asian airlines or even the 4 star European carriers.

Calgary to Montreal return trip - My wife and I paid extra for their new Plus class seats. While the extra legroom and priority boarding was good the seats were no wider and you were still cheek to cheek with other passengers. Out of Calgary some yahoos thought it was party time which didn't let up for the whole flight. Out of Montreal someone else with no regard for others put his seat back as soon as he got on the plane and left it there the entire flight. The staff always try their best but the Plus seats leave a lot to be desired as well as some of the passengers. The drinks were free but if you don't drink you may not get the full value of this seating.

### Jet Airways customer review
Round-trip from Toronto to New Delhi via Brussels in May 2014. The plane was on time but the flight attendants were rude. They never smiled or wanted to exchange pleasantries. The seats were cramped and tight. I was traveling with my husband and our journey to New Delhi was completed without much hassle. On our way back to Toronto we were seated in two different seats and was told at the counter that the flights were full and they wouldn't change our seats. On boarding the same rude flight attendants greeted us. The only time we saw them smiling was when we were leaving the plane. On boarding we noticed that it was not only us who were seated separately almost all the couples had the same issue fortunately we were able to exchange seats. This was the same problem on the flight from Brussels to Toronto. The food we received was of substandard quality when compared to other airlines. The fruit tray they served for breakfast had mould on the fruit. The inflight entertainment system had very few movies we listened to our iPod instead. Ground staff at New Delhi Airport were rude and not helpful. They need considerable improvements in organizing their seats and other basic things like training flight attendants to international standards.

We flew Jet Airways doing a round trip Toronto-Brussels. We were a family of 9 (3 generations) and this was our 1st experience with this airline. We were pleasantly surprised after reading such negative reviews. Flight attendants were helpful and courteous seats were adequate food was fine and our flights were on time and we arrived safely. I do not know what people expect our needs were met it was an overall pleasant experience.

### Jet Airways customer review
The lack of inflight entertainment is rather a joke. 3 flights within a week 1 flight none of the TV's worked and then 2 flights and no TV's. There are advertisements for tablets for rental but "oh they forgot to load them this morning" is the excuse given each time. I specifically prefer Westjet for the TV's in the back of the seats but seems they are taking these away to force you to purchase tablets. For years I felt they were the best and would only fly Westjet but I guess its time to begin shopping around.

I flew whilst 30 weeks pregnant with my husband and 2.5 year old toddler from Mumbai to London. The cabin crew were rude - I requested an additional pillow - not available apparently! 2 of the toilets on the flight were out of order but I saw cabin crew using it! Food quantity was pathetic - we had pre-ordered hindu non veg meal - told it was not available when mentioned we had pre-ordered they finally turned up with it. The quality of children's meal was awful. Jet Airways cabin crew made the whole journey unpleasant!

I flew Trivandrum-Abu Dhabi-Kuwait on 24th May. Other than the seats being slightly cramped I found the whole experience a pleasant one. The stop over in Abu Dhabi was a little haywire and needs to be tightened up. The flight arrived earlier than the scheduled time of arrival. The entertainment and food was pretty good as well. So overall I'd give it a 7 out of 10.

I recently did a flight from Singapore through Delhi to London. The first leg was not all pleasant. The actual flight was smooth but the service was very disappointing. It was as though the passengers were an irritation particularly to the male crew members. My in-flight entertainment system didn't work at all but when I asked about this shoulders were shrugged. I asked for an extra bread roll having just seen a bag of spare ones being carried to the galley to be told it was not possible. My half a cup of coffee was perfunctorily poured with a grunt. Happily the second leg was much better although the seats seemed badly padded and were not comfortable when compared to other airlines. Staff certainly did not seem to be happy in their work but were at least polite. If Jet Airways want to be seen as a world class airline they need to be more consistent and realise that their business relies on satisfied customers. I have taken other Jet journeys over the last five years and had better experiences but this last one means that I shall think seriously before using them again.

I fly the JED-BOM route often on business class. The flight is usually fine without issues. But my question is this: since Jet Airways has the highest ticket prices why can't they afford to hire an airport lounge at Jeddah? Do they really have to use a a quarter photocopied page as a voucher for executive travelers to get a meal at the common cafeteria?

I used Jet Airways to go to Singapore for a conference in May 2014. I was disabled this particular trip with a dislocated knee. I was flying Business class and had already placed a special assistance request at the time of booking the ticket. i was also a Jet airways frequent flyer. My experience was so bad / awful that I never want to travel this airline ever again. There was no assistance provided. The wheelchair took forever to come at the Delhi airport. The person pushing the wheelchair left me in the lounge and disappeared. When final call started being announced my father had to push my wheelchair and carry the hand luggage to the flight. On flight and at check in when we asked them if a message had been sent to Singapore for a wheelchair to be available at the landing station but the staff was rude and unhelpful. On flight they were even worse! On the way back the staff at check in at Singapore said they could not get me a wheelchair and scoffed at me and my crutches and told me to walk. The immigration security officer saw me and asked me why I was not being assisted - he not only took me through immigration himself but arranged a Singapore Airport Authority person to get a wheelchair in 2 minutes and assist me.

Inseat screens with poor quality and cannot be switched off. Two rounds of drinks and food for purchase. Crew appearance lacks professionalism. No farewell as crew already stuck with their heads between the seat rows cleaning the seat pockets. Checked Baggage arrived within time the belt and was free of charge.

Great airline stewards and stewardesses. Good food but the flight from Chennai to Singapore was nothing short of appalling in terms of aircraft condition. I was in Seat 2A and the edge of side of the seat was broken and patched with industrial tape! When the passenger pushed his seat to a recline position (and these are not flat beds) he knocked back my food tray and my video. It also made coming out of my seat to visit the toilet very tough. Such a good airline flying international and its business class seats are rubbish and patched with tape!

Beware the Q400 turbo prop! Although they were touted as being for low demand small market use you will get stuck on them on main routes. If you pay for a Plus fare you get ripped off as there are no plus fares seats on these planes. Everyone gets the same hard as rock tight and vibrating seats with lots of noise! And you get to enjoy all that discomfort for longer because they are slow! If it is winter the Plus fare gives you the extra joy of being the first people to board and then freeze your butt off because these planes board from the runway. So you are sitting near the door with the cold wind whipping in.

Flew from Hong Kong to Kathmandu via Mumbai. The flight to Mumbai was decent but on the way back I was a little taken aback by the service. There were flight attendants shouting at people and when I asked for water I was told very rudely to wait. Mumbai airport was an utter nightmare with men and women searched and separated upon landing not to mention the mosquitoes which were everywhere. I would highly recommend flying via Delhi which we did on the return and it was a more pleasurable experience. Seats were large enough otherwise and food was alright. Would not recommend unless you have a very cheap ticket.

My flight was from POS to YYZ (round trip). I must say I will recommend this airline. My fights to and from were smooth and no problems were experienced. The staff were beyond helpful also their interaction with the passengers onboard was excellent! The check in counter staff are also more than pleasant! The inflight entertainment is perfect as their are individual screens where there are about 5 different channels all showing different movies! This is brilliant as you can choose which movie you prefer and when its done you can just switch to another channel for another movie (my flight was about 5.5 hours!). One thing I was disappointed in was the snacks even though they were served twice it was such a small quantity! Despite that I give WestJet the thumbs up!

Flight from YYZ to YQB was re-directed back to YYZ with only vague explanation about poor conditions (no mention about this prior to leaving Toronto first time we were told was 15 minutes before our expected arrival time in Quebec). I can completely understand that poor weather conditions are not Westjet's fault. However during the same period of time 2 Air Canada flights successfully landed at YQB (one from YUL and another from YYZ) with yet another leaving YYZ for YQB at the time as our plane arrived back in Toronto. Instead of refuelling and heading back to YQB flight was cancelled and we were left to fly the following day delaying arrival by 14 hours for a 1 hour flight. It is clear Westjet does not have the capacity to deal with extenuating circumstances leaving their customers out of luck.

Chennai to London via Mumbai. My flight from Mumbai was scheduled to take off at 1.40am IST and land in London at 6.45am GMT. I had planned another flight from London to Stuttgart at 8.45am GMT (2 hours later) keeping in mind check out immigration and check in time. The flight from Mumbai took off 4 hours later at 5.40 in the morning. Now I have been on flights that have been delayed and it is no new experience for me. What was new for me though was the way in which the whole issue was dealt with. The first officer announced 10 minutes before scheduled departure that the flight was being delayed 15 minutes due to maintenance checks. Almost 30 minutes later the Captain came on and said that there were delays and due to a technical check we would be delayed by a further 30 minutes. Almost an hour later we were told that there are even further delays and through out the entire time span the passengers were left absolutely clueless. Never ever before have I been on a flight where the ETA on the flight information screen was only shared with passengers on the Inflight Entertainment 30 minutes before landing. This is the first and the last time that I will fly Jet Airways.

YYZ-BRU in economy. Plane was on time facilities were ok staff were hard to find outside service times. The absolute worst thing about the experience were the other passengers. They all seemed to be high-maintenance passengers: really elderly people and many bawling and screaming infants. The children did not stop screaming all the way to and from Brussels. I would have expected this on a low cost charter airline but this took me by surprise. Of course the staff did little or nothing to help keep things calm you just had to grin and bear it or spend the $500 for an upgrade to Premiere class.

I just booked a trip from Winnipeg to Las Vegas. The departure and return times are ridiculous that is if you want a direct flight. The departure time is at 21.50 while the return time is at 00.30. Not wanting to return at that time I arranged to switch times and take a later flight in return only to discover that any later flights required a stop over which adds hours onto your travel time. Meanwhile there are more than one direct flight to other cities. Calgary springs to mind where there is one trip at 08.00 and the next around 10.00 or 11.00. A few years ago when I returned from Mexico again having to stop in Calgary many of our companions were immediately able to get on connecting flights while those going to Winnipeg had to wait until the next day which added to our costs. I am beginning to think WestJet has something against Winnipeg because after having to pay $266 for a return flight at a more reasonable time with now a stop in Calgary I am not liking WestJet so much.

Flew Calgary-Kamloops return. Paid full price to ride in a tiny airplane called a Q400. It arrived late left late and parked way out on the tarmac in -20c with a wind. No room for Canadians wearing winter clothes nor their luggage. Just booked Westjet to Vegas return - they did not allow the booking agent to seat my wife and I together we were in middle seats different rows. I made this booking a month ago - to change seats is $90. Air Canada does allow spouses booking at the same time to sit together no charge. Westjet has lost its way. My expectations of better service are gone.

9W119 LHR-BOM 5th April. Flight was on time cabin crew attentive. Downsides were that the seats on the Boeing 777 weren't the most comfortable in the world and the food wasn't fantastic either. It took 1.5 hours for our baggage to come through at Mumbai so even though we arrived an hour early at about 22.30 we didn't leave until midnight. 9W618 CCU-BOM 21st April. Almost exactly the same although the food was better. 9W118 BOM-LHR 21st April. Flight was delayed by over an hour because the wind changed and they had to dump 13 tonnes of cargo (thankfully not the luggage). It was very turbulent almost all the way and the cabin crew had to sit down quite a lot but they still managed to get round the cabin 4 times to serve drinks and food. Inflight entertainment was a little sparse but it kept me entertained for 8 hours so can't complain.

We recently flew Jet BC from Mumbai to Newark through Brussels. Plane was in decent repair and comfortable. Good AVOD. Nice blanket and duvet. Impoverished amenities kit and only offered on 1st leg. FAs were well groomed and attentive. Limited selection but decent champagne/wines. But Jet served the worst food (choosing non veg) I have ever received on an airline. It bordered on inedible. One meal had an empty plate on it! They will not be internationally competitive with this cuisine especially on the Brussels-Mumbai leg. Buffet in Brussels lounge was primarily Indian cuisine.

I certainly wouldn't fly with this airline again. I had possibly the worst flight experience in all my years of travelling. Non existent fight attendants resulting in a large party of young travellers helping themselves to vast quantities of booze. As a result I ended up without a seat and the crew kept fobbing me off saying they were trying to sort it. I was left standing for 2.5 hours. Absolutely unacceptable. Never will they get my business again.

London - Mumbai - Goa in Business. We were very pleasantly surprised by the quality. Attentive Cabin Staff comfortable lie flat seats/beds. Small but excellent choice of wine and champagne. Dinner was of a very good standard and very well presented. Staff made up the beds and the topper was a nice touch on the overnight flight. Transfer at Mumbai to the Domestic Terminal is a pain but is not Jet Airways fault. The 45 minute flight from Mumbai to Goa was fine too. With a soft drink and a snack meal served. Return flight were very good also and all were virtually on time within a few minutes Before landing the Stewardess came round the Cabin and thanked each passenger for travelling with Jet. A nice personal touch. Jet Staff had taken all the Business Class passengers hold baggage off the carousel and kindly put it into a roped off area in front of the baggage carousel. Must say the time from plane to exit at LHR was one of the shortest ever experienced! Certainly would travel with Jet again. Excellent value service and I say with some regret rather better than many recent flights with BA.

### Jet Airways customer review
I like this airline would choose it in future and would recommend to others. Only issue is the leg from Mumbai to Goa which is often delayed and seems unorganised but fly business class and like that I can accrue airmiles via jet privilege club membership.

BOM-LHR on 30 March 2014 flight was not so pleasant. Flight departed Mumbai at lunchtime 1pm however lunch was served 2 hours later by which time everyone is starving and hungry. 1 hour into the flight 1 drink and packet of peanuts. Lunch was ok though portion size was very small. During the flight there were 3 rounds of drinks 1 serving per round rest of the time the air hostesses were never around. The final meal was a measly croissant as the main dish. Still not enough for an average human. All in all a starving flight and I arrived hungry. Inflight system was mediocre and leg room is just adequate. In case you want to have a comfortable flight Jet airways is not the flight its definitely not going to be mine.

Traveled on a Westjet flight back from Antigua on March 30 2014. Once again I was seated next to a passenger that clearly did not fit into their seat. 5 hours of leaning towards the opposite side of my seat as most of the person body is still pressed up against me. I am really tired of this and I feel the airline needs to do something to change how their seats are or how they sell their seats. It may not be fair to the oversized passenger but what about me. The person who paid for a seat but can't sit in it!

### Jet Airways customer review
My husband flies 4 times a month from Edmonton to Vancouver and Westjet is always late so he always chooses AC but now we are moving and the only direct option is Westjet. Today was his first flight with this airline in ages and it's already 45 minutes late. I'm really hoping a new carrier comes in locally.

We traveled from YYZ to SXM on Feb 23/14 and as usual the crew did an excellent job. Smooth flight and on time both ways. Keep up the great service and please start flying YYZ to anywhere in the EU. We'll take it from there.

Managed to wangle a free upgrade from Business to First on a BOM to LHR flight. For the money it would have cost had I been paying it seemed pretty fair (it's pretty cheap versus other carriers). Got the red carpet treatment off my incoming Jet domestic flight as I was met by Jet ground staff and ushered into my own car for the journey to the International terminal whilst the latter is a huge improvement on its predecessor the way transfers work between the two terminals remains a bit barmy borne out by the fact that my car took the public roads! The First Class lounge is pleasant enough but generally continues the Indian tradition of largely mediocre airport lounges. On board the "hardware" is pretty impressive - flat beds enclosed suites and the like although I didn't find the seat/bed as comfortable as I would have hoped given its generous proportions. Food remains a bit of a weak point dinner seemed to be the same as you got in Business. Staff friendly but didn't leave much of an impression to be honest. Entertainment pretty decent.

### Jet Airways customer review
Took a return flight from Toronto to Mumbai via Brussels. Positive: In all 4 sectors the flights were generally on time. Only minor delays. Negative: 1) Cramped seats 2) Non-working ear-phones in two sectors 3) Indifferent attitude of in-flight crew towards passengers 4) Poor or non existent movie options in major Indian regional languages 5) Sloppy in-flight service. 6) Can not input your frequent flyer # in manage your booking. 7) Website is not very user friendly 8) Complaints are not looked into properly. I would not fly again.

I have traveled Westjet since it first started flying in 2006. I have always been proud to fly this Calgary based Airline in Canada. I fly frequently 5-6 times a year and it was on a flight from Calgary-Toronto that I was bumped into Plus Seats which was great. However on my return flight from Ottawa a week later I was back in economy seating as I had purchased economy for both inbound and outbound but when I sat down I had to squeeze myself into the seat. This has never been a problem before and I was sitting at the bulkhead on the 737-6 so I requested to move from a flight attendant. I am 6'4" so flights have always been a little tight but this was like nothing I have experienced. The flight attendant accommodated my request to the seats in front of the exit row that don't recline. Same problem when the person in front of me put their seat back. I again requested to move into and the only seats available were in the exit row mid-cabin which was empty but I was told I couldn't sit there as they were Plus Fare seats. I was shocked! I can't help being tall and had I known I would have purchased a plus fare in Ottawa. The flight attendant did not allow me to sit anywhere else and it was by far the worst flight I have been on. I contacted Westjet with my disappointment and received a standard auto-generated letter back. If you are over 6ft tall and/or have legs longer than 32inches BUY PLUS FARE. I however will be flying another Canadian Airline (AC) from now on as their seat pitch is what Westjet's used to be in economy and are no extra charge. Big mistake.

### Jet Airways customer review
I am not a frequent flyer but do fly 2/3 times a year I always use WestJet. On a recent flight back from Toronto I upgraded my seat to the first row when I got up to leave the aircraft looking back at the seats behind me i noticed a bunch of people that had adjustable head supports on their seats. When I checked mine it also had this. Every flight they spend time talking about all the safety features how about letting people know about the comfort features like adjustable head rest's and foot rests under the seat in front and how to select entertainment. That would make WestJet stand out even more in customer service.

### Jet Airways customer review
The staff were great and the overall cleanliness of the plane good. The flights were on time but the coach seats not have no leg room as they have reduced it to add economy plus seating. Not sure if this was the right move for this airline not comfortable at all. Meal offering on board very limited and channel/movies limited.

### Jet Airways customer review
Goa to Mumbai - when checking our bags we were told we need to pay for an excess weight of 9 kg. Upon checking in Mumbai for our continuing international flight we found out that we did not have any excess weight! We recommend checking with another agent if you are asked to pay for excess weight. No food on this short flight we did get a voucher for a light meal - it was a small box full with junk food inedible. They do offer wraps vegetarian or chicken for purchase on the plane very average quality.

Return flight March 12th flight 1119 from Las Vegas to Toronto. Then supposed to be on Flight 358 from Toronto to Ottawa at 8am but ended up on a 2pm flight to Ottawa instead. Terrible experience. Our first flight was delayed 2.5 hours so before we even left we knew we'd miss our connection. The rep told us not to book the next flight as they would hold the plane for us as there were many in the same boat. They didn't. We got stuck waiting another 5 hours even though there were many other carriers with flights they could have put us on. We were told to go to customer service to be first in line for standby. We did and they told us to check back every 15 minutes. We did. There ended up being 2 spots on an earlier flight that they gave to someone who happened to just walk up to the gate. When we asked why we didn't get those seats we were told nobody told them we were waiting. We were told lie after lie by 4 different reps. Will not fly WestJet again!

Outbound to Palm Springs from Calgary was #1468 on Feb 26/14 and return from Palm Springs to Calgary on March 11/14 was flight #1469. My parents just got back from Palm Springs and they as well as myself were so impressed with WestJet! My father who required a wheelchair had help from the moment the plane landed right to when their luggage arrived. The flight attendant wheeled him through to customs the baggage area helped them with their luggage and even brought it out to the concourse area. My parents would not be able to travel on their own without this kind of help.

Jaipur to Mumbai Feb 13 2014 on JetKonnect 9W-K-7178 and Jet Airways 9W-403 from Mumbai to Kochin. I was worried about taking a flight in India but was pleasantly surprised. The JetKonnect flight we took from Jaipur to Mumbai was pleasant. They charged us an over baggage fee and were really strict with the weight. Only inflight complaint was that the seats barely had any padding and were visibly marked and dirty. They looked like they were recycled from the 80's.

### Jet Airways customer review
Outbound to Las Vegas March 7th and return to Toronto March 10. The only complaint I can think of is the rude passengers who recline their seats! They should really think about how much space you are taking away from the person behind you! It makes it difficult for them to eat or work on their computer. Had one delay and it wasn't WestJets fault. My husband and I choose to pay $300 more for our trip in February just to get WestJet as our airline and would do it again! For the people who don't get the wagon with the drinks as often as you like there is a button up where the lights are just press it and I'm sure the staff would be more than happy to serve. I will be continuing to use this service!

### Jet Airways customer review
Goa to Mumbai economy. We were upgraded to Premiere as there was a double booking for our seats. Short flight so meal service began immediately after cruising. The pursers were selectively asking passengers for meal choices. Those left were told no non -veg options only a veg option left. I refused and he asked me if I wanted fruit or dessert I declined and asked for tea. After every passenger was served their meals and their coffee tea service in trays one of the crew dumped a cup of tea on my tray. Considering I had asked for one item I would have expected a tea tray offered at the same time as the other service. Anyway I really do not expect much from the arrogant and indifferent crew having had bad experiences in the past with Jet we only fly them on short flights.

London to Amritsar via Delhi and Delhi to London Economy. We (2) found the flights better than we expected them to be but there are opportunities for improvement. Our seats were reasonably comfortable all flights were on time long haul had VOD to keep us entertained but the film choice was a little restricted and old and there seemed to be no resume viewing option (i.e. continue from where you left off). Food was reasonable the cabin crew on our aisle on the way out were incompetent (those on the adjacent isle knew what they were doing). The meal on the night flight on the way out arrived 2 hours after we took off which was far too late. My major complaint would be that all the cabin crew (bar one) disappeared once the meal had been served and did not appear again until the next meal. No one came around offering water and the toilets were not serviced. Despite all of this of the cheap budget airlines flying to Delhi (and return) they are not the worst.

### Jet Airways customer review
We flew London to Delhi then internally Udaipur to Mumbai Mumbai to Goa Goa to Mumbai then back from Mumbai to London. Overall good. Which amazed us as two years ago we flew London to Delhi and back and swore never to use Jet again as the flight home was the worst we've ever had anywhere in the world. This time the flight from London to Delhi was very good nice plane good crew average food. Internal flights were also good. The flight back - well it was an older plane a bit tatty inside the floors hadn't been cleaned properly between flights the food was terrible the seats sagged but it landed ahead of schedule and the cabin crew were great. So 4 flights out of 5 were very good and if they put on a new plane and better food on the last leg they'd have scored a very good overall.

Toronto Person flight 2742 to Liberia Costa Rica. Flight delayed over an hour. Return Liberia Costa Rica flight 2743 to Toronto first thing in the morning I log on to WestJet website to check the flight status flight not found. Went to the airport and told that flight 2743 is now flight 4343. We board the plane and flight attendants inform everyone we are going to Mexico. WestJet changed the flight number from 2743 to 4343 but they did not import the passengers’ data from 2743 into 4343. Now you have passengers who paid for seat selection and Plus services and they are not getting what they paid for. I need an aisle seat for a medical issue and I need to get up a move around. Instead of getting an aisle seat I found myself in the middle seat.

We traveled on 6th-7th March 2014 from HYD-AUH-DMM (9W 550 and 9W 526) and we had a horrible experience. We are senior citizens and have lots of air travel experience but this one was the worst so far! There was no water in the toilets! The flight from HYD to AUH arrived and landed but it took more than an hour before we could get off the plane! Apparently Jet seems to have the least priority by air traffic control. Me and my wife had to sit near a stinking toilet for the 526 flight. They closed all toilets. Imagine having no access to toilets in mid air! Will never fly Jet again.

Recently my wife and I flew from Calgary to Honolulu with a change of planes in Vancouver. The flight from Calgary to Vancouver took the usual one hour or so. However our flight from Vancouver to Honolulu took an hour longer than I had experienced on past flights. I find it very annoying that despite the excess charges levied on us unfortunate travellers for baggage seat selection and no decent food we are forced to sit in uncomfortable conditions for another hour while the airline reduces speed to save on fuel!

Flew from Montreal to Turks and Caicos. Tickets for this 4 hour RT flight were $1350 but the service was like we booked a cut-rate airline. On the flight out they kept us on the runway from 11.30-2.30 while dealing with fuel line issue and during this time served us 2 very small cookies. They then flew us to Toronto to get to a plane that could fly farther and served en route only alcohol or water. The flight was full of starving kids who had been on the plane for 4 hours but we were told no food or other drink because flight to Toronto "too short. We were in seats in front of the exit row which did not recline and we were not warned about this. For the flight back we could not check-in online because they wanted to charge us extra for our seats on the way out even though our seat selection said zero dollars when we chose it. On the flight itself in-flight entertainment broken meals were cold sandwiches and by the third row they were out of all sandwiches except turkey. On arrival in Montreal there was no attendant to connect that plane to the gate so the pilot had to call for one. Ten minutes later we saw him scampering up the ladder to the gate. Then they let us off but no one had opened the door from the gate hallway to the airport so another 10 minutes there. Then about 20 bags came out then a 20 minutes delay with nothing then the rest of the bags.

### Jet Airways customer review
WestJet online booking system allows seat selection and charges for that ($21 usually). On several occasions in recent past my seat was changed from when I purchased it (and paid seat selection fee) to when I checked in. Went mysteriously from an aisle seat to a middle or window. No notice or explanation; found out when checking in and re-selected at that time. On one occasion had to pay $45 more for plus seat because no others were available. Check your seat assignment. Entertainment system poor and they've started putting on about 10 minutes worth of advertisements that you have to watch at beginning of flight and there are constant announcements during flight that interrupt the shows. Flight staff are friendly and helpful.

### Jet Airways customer review
Overall the service was extremely poor. Air hostesses behaved as though they are doing passengers a favour did not attend to passengers in time. While travelling from UK to Goa there were no toilet rolls in the toilet. While returning back there was no hand wash. Although meals were included but were not provided in fact they stated I had to pay for my meal from Goa to Bombay. Requested a cup of tea it never arrived.

Flew Pune-Delhi-London. Constant changes to schedule meant that I had less than an hour to transfer in Delhi instead of three which is not enough to get through the Indian airport rubber stamping fiesta. Was not informed of this via email or phone only found out when I checked my booking 3 weeks before departure. Had to change the date since the Pune-Delhi flight I was going to take was cancelled and they refused to book me on another airline for my original date. Flight crew are unfriendly food is inedible (pink rice with brown sauce from the look of it). The seat in front of you reclines right into your face inflight entertainment has long and repeated ads. Fly any other airline to and from India if you can.

April 2013 my husband and I went to Mexico. On our way home we had an early flight leaving from Cancun airport. Because of mechanical difficulties our plane was delayed hour after hour during this time period WestJet gave us all food vouchers! Finally our fight was canceled and would be rescheduled for the next morning. It was a little concerning at first. WestJet took such good care of us they had shuttle buses take us to the Marriott in Cancun paid for the hotel supper and breakfast. I recommend WestJet.

My onward connection from Delhi to Amritsar was delayed by approx 5 hours. The staff in the airport were not proactive. They were not explaining the problems and we had to keep going to the desk to ask on if there were further delays (started as 3 hours delayed and then was subsequently moved out by 30 min increments). On the way back the Amritsar to Delhi flight was delayed by 20 mins and passport control in Delhi is poor cumbersome and slow (only 3 staff for 6 counters). The Jet Airways staff were randomly pushing some passengers up the queue to the annoyance of other Jet Airways passengers on the same flight and Air India passengers too. In the end I had to run to gate for boarding due to incompetence.

Delhi to South Africa via Mumbai. Flight from Delhi to Mumbai was horrible even though it was business class. It didn't have entertainment and the food wasn't great.

One way Vancouver - Calgary trip and I paid for "plus seating". When asked to pre-board the line in Vancouver was huge and I couldn't seem to get the gate agents to care much. Even though I was seat number 2 in "plus seating" there was no room for my half-filled "fits in the tester box" bag and they let people on with massive pieces of luggage. So much so that I counted at least 30 pieces of luggage that had to be checked in at the gate. This caused a 20 minute delay even though it could have easily been avoided earlier. The flight attendant was tired and gruff. The flight itself was OK but the entertainment system is poor - half the channels don't work and the screens are tiny. Plus seats" have more leg room but are still narrow. Once we disembarked I wait another 20 minutes for "checked baggage". 40 minutes late for a 1.25 hour business flight is not adequate.

9W 120 - London to Delhi. We took a total of 5 flights with Jet. All flights had one thing in common and that was the cabin crew who were the unfriendliest and least professional crew I have encountered in over 30 years of flying. They made no safety checks before we left Heathrow (children were sitting on parents laps with no safety harness) did not smile and threw food and drink at you.. Seats were tiny in fairness to Jet our flights arrived largely on time and safely. The fares were cheap but I would have paid more to get a better service.

I will not book with WestJet again. I fly about two times a year and always book WestJet due to their "customer service". The last two times I have booked with WestJet I've been disappointed. Going from YEG airport to Las Vegas and on the way home the TV's were not working. That is one of the major reason we pay extra to book with WestJet. Makes the flight a lot easier lets face it no one enjoys flying. The next flight I booked with WestJet my departure was at 7.30am I arrived to the airport at 6.10 and they would not let me board. I missed my flight even though I was 1hr and 20 mins early. The lady that was dealing with my flight had no compassion and when I asked her if there was anything WestJet could do she simply said no and it would cost another $80 to re-book with a different flight. Most of the times the plans aren't on time and we just have to deal with it. I was just very disappointed with the way WestJet treated me and do not believe they are worth the cost of their flights.

30 January 2013 flight 9W10 from Mumbai to Singapore (Business Class). Technical problems with plane resulted in an hour delay. Repairs were attempted while on runway and after again trying to depart plane was moved to another part of runway close to airport building. We were parked there for 6 hours. During that time absolute mayhem took place. For the first few hours there were no communication and it became clear this airline has no contingency plan and should not be flying. As business class passengers we received no support and passengers were physically prevented from leaving the plane though we were about 25 metres away from an airbridge. Half the plane without connections were put on another plane to Singapore and we were kept detained on the plane for another few hours. Eventually a Customer Service Manager appeared. We were then told it would take 3 days before we could fly due to tickets not being available. After insisting on tickets it took another hour before we were offered economy class tickets which were rejected. After another hour we were offered premium class tickets to Bangkok and then Melbourne. The flight was 2 am and we were offered a hotel room which I had to share with a stranger. I was very relieved to get on Thai Airlines from Bangkok. As for Jet Airways I will never fly with them again!

26th Jan 2014 I travelled from Mumbai to Dubai and 30th Jan 2014 from Dubai to Mumbai. On both the sectors I experienced the following: No beverage serving etiquette. I ordered a tomato juice and the airhostess simply dumped a glass without any ice. Ice was offered on request but she did not offer me coaster salt and pepper stirrer or a paper napkin. I asked for some Savory Bites with my Juice and she offered me on demand. I immediately called the senior crew member and he responded that he is helpless as airline is not supplying adequate stock and hence they only provide such basic things on request only. He also indicated that due to inadequate crew on board he is aware of many such lapses. Same serving process I observed with the fellow passengers. Tray table was bent and there was no possibility to keep any beverages or food on the tray. Main food was absolutely awful fruits and salad were also stale. Most of the crew were unfriendly and tired. Toilets were dirty. Only one type of cheapest hand tissue papers was stacked. Narrow seats and uncomfortable leg room. Audio and Video system was not working.

Our skis arrived on the oversize belt in 15 minutes then our bags arrived a half an hour later. Very aggravating.

Returning from Cancun Jan 28 2014 to Toronto. Waited in Airport for 11.30 am flight but for some unknown reason Westjet decided to give our plane to another group flying to Ottwawa. This left us stranded with a new departure time of 10.00 pm that night. Turns out that this flight did not leave until 4.30 am the next morning. Some passengers would even wait longer as their connection flight would not correspond with the 4.30 am flight and were not allowed to go. Our plane should never have been given to another group the Ottawa group should have had to wait for another plane. I was travelling with a group of 16 people which was booked through Westjet Vacations. A Westjet Rep in Cancun Airport managed to get all 16 of us on the next flight at 4.40 pm to Toronto. The reps in Toronto when we landed rushed us through customs and held the plane to Thunder Bay for us.

I flew for the first time with Jet Airways premiere class and was very happy with the entire trip. There were 6 sectors with the round trip and every single sector the flight was on time or early. The food was very nice and service excellent. The Delhi - Brussels and Brussels - Toronto were excellent. Ground staff at Delhi were not helpful at all as immigration wouldn't allow passengers into the Gates any earlier than 4 hrs before the flight as a transit passenger I was stuck in the middle.

Flew Edmonton to Comox Jan 17. Pilot made 2 attempts to land in Comox but had to abort so went back to Edmonton. The pilot provided very little info except to make announcement that we were returning to Edmonton. As a passenger this was very confusing. The only info from flight attendants was that we could make alternate arrangements once we were back in Edmonton. Once we got back to Edmonton the passengers waited in one line for almost one hour not moving then all directed to the check-in area where we waited almost 2 more hours with very little progress. I finally called Westjet and made alternate plans to fly to Vancouver late that night.

January 2014 London to New Delhi with return from Mumbai. Design of seats meant that legroom was perhaps more acceptable than many airlines provide in economy. Flights were on time. That is the good bit. On the other side of the coin the flight crew were unfriendly. They did what they had to but with no sense of enjoying their jobs. No assistance given to those who needed help with luggage. They just stood and watched whilst other passengers helped out. Very strange and in contrast to the general attitude we encountered during a delightful holiday in India. Poorest food on a long haul flight since Delta served up something inedible about 15 years ago. Entertainment way behind the competition. We will certainly return to India but it won't be on Jet Airways.

KWI-BOM-SIN-BNE return. KWI-BOM - ordinary Boeing 737. No PTVs. Polite Flight Attendants (they have to cater to all kinds in the KWI-BOM sector). Avoided use of washrooms due to co-travellers. Food uneventful. BOM-SIN Airbus and much better flight in terms of seats/ newness of aircraft. Service was good. Food was uneventful - nothing to complain about. PTVs were good and my children enjoyed the programmes. SIN- BNE / BNE-SIN was code share with Qantas - so no comments. SIN-BOM - same as outgoing service. BOM-KWI - still a Boeing but with PTVs. Flight attendants were very good. I do have one complaint and this is not a small one. As mentioned before I avoid use of toilets during flights from and to the Middle East for obvious reasons. However the flight had not even taken off and I went to the toilet and found not even a single toilet seat cover. The male flight attendant immediately and promptly cleaned it for me. In other words no complaints with regards to the flight attendants - but the airline really must provide these basic things on a flight! In all good value for money.

9W567: Dammam to Delhi 9/1/2014. Scheduled departure 23.55 actual departure 05.00 10/1/2014. Uninformed of delay pre-flight advanced information would have saved waiting sitting in an uncomfortable waiting area. Consequent to the delay I missed my Delhi-Lucknow connection flight 9W2244 10/1/2014 departure time 09.05. Arrival at the Jet Airways ticket office I was to witness to sheer mayhem total lack of any organisation. The ticket office manager was oblivious to the mayhem. 13/1/2014 9W348 Lucknow to Mumbai. This flight was also 2 hours late again unannounced. 22/1/2014 flight 9W564 Mumbai-Dammam 19.30 though initially announced as being delayed to 20.45 departed at 21.05. When we were called for departure we did not expect a tour of the airport. On arriving at the aircraft we were kept waiting in the bus. The flight was uncomfortable due to the seating arrangement being primarily for the Asian human body frame not a Westerners human frame cramped and uncomfortable to say the least.

Pretty good trip with Jet LHR to Bangalore via Mumbai return. Domestic flights were perfectly competent international legs on a B777-300 were on a par with BA and Thai business class products. Seats good proper flat bed and very nice to have the crew make up the seat into a bed with a padded topper. On board ents a little sparse compared to other airlines but sufficient for a 10 hour flight. Skyteam lounge at LHR pretty good lounges in India consistently lousy. Food decent enough. All in all it did what it said on the tin (all the flights were bang on time) and I'd be very happy to try them again in business.

I recently arrived back home after being in Thailand for 4 weeks flying LHR-BOM-BKK on my outbound flight and BKK-DEL-LHR for my inbound. The London flights were fantastic with great cabin interior entertainment food and service could not fault them! The Mumbai to Bangkok flight was good but not the same as my Bangkok - Delhi flight on my return. The aircraft type (Boeing 737-800) were the same however the Bangkok to Delhi flight has personal touch screen entertainment and a better meal selection the Mumbai to Bangkok had drop down screens and not the best of meal selections. However apart from that flights were all on time service and comfort were great value for money.

All I can say is that the experience was second to none. Staff were excellent courteous and helpful and the flights were fine both ways - Toronto-Calgary return. We are traveling with Westjet again in 2 weeks to the Mayan Riviera and are actually looking forward to it.

Flew the SIN-BOM return flight and took two different types of flights. For going took Jet Airways 9W 09 on the 737-800. Flight was for the same price as the one hour earlier 9W 11 on the A330 for the same SIN-BOM flight and yet the PTV was barely working. It kept on switching on and off. The passenger beside me could barely use hers with the very poor touch screen. Content was minimum and not what I expected from India's premium airline. Food was good but we weren't even served the usual tea/coffee. Seats were uncomfortable. Coming back flew the A330 On 9W 12 BOM-SIN. PTV was MUCH better this time round and seats were a much bigger improvement over the 738 flight but food wasn't as good. FA's were pleasant and helpful on both flights. While definitely India's best premium airline when compared to Air India it still doesn't live up to the much higher standards of Kingfisher Airlines when I flew it on the same sector few years ago which was on an A320 but the experience of KF was still definitely 5* and better. If SQ and 9W have the same pricing on the SIN-India routes would recommend no doubt SQ. If prices are very different for both with SQ being much (500SGD?) more expensive then Jet does still give a pleasant flight for the sector. Got an amazing deal on Jet for this sector this time though.

Flew to Hawaii. Going there was fine there were weather delays but everything was handled perfectly. Coming back another story. In 5 years the process has not changed no kiosk confusing check in as counters are shared with other airlines. My flight was late getting into Vancouver. We all had to line up to get reassigned to other flights. They seemed completely bewildered and disorganized. There were 4 counters for check in. There was a gentleman who was asking people where they were going and several of us found ourselves in the wrong line. Check in was slow and tedious. Waited in line for over 1.5 hours to be asked to stand to the side. For some reason I was not already rebooked on another flight. The co-ordinator did give me food vouchers so added points for that. The flight attendants on all flights were excellent so points for that. The check in counter at HI took off points as they seemed confused. Bottom line - I will not use WJ to fly to Hawaii again any time soon.

Dec 31st 2013 me and my family went on a vacation trip to Aruba thinking it would be a very relaxing time and it was until the return to Toronto. Because of weather conditions the plane that was scheduled to go to Aruba to pick up and bring back the passengers from flight 2699 never arrived Tuesday Jan 7th 2014. After an entire day trying to call and get an answer from the airline finally with got to speak with somebody from Westjet who only said that there would not be a rescue flight later that week but passengers had to wait until Tuesday Jan 14th 2014 to get our fight back home but they were not responsible for any expenses until that day. In my case we had to take a flight Aruba-Curacao and Curacao-Trinidad and Trinidad-Toronto with all the expenses it caused in airplane tickets meals and hotel. Please be very careful if buying tickets from this company.

Vancouver to Saskatoon via Calgary on Dec 22 2013 during the Christmas travel season. Due to the ice storm in Eastern Canada all flights were delayed not anyone's fault. Flights were pleasant and comfortable and staff eager to assist. Upon arrival in Saskatoon very delayed at 3am we discovered my partner's suitcase was broken when it came off the plane. Expecting a hassle we went to the Westjet baggage counter. The agent was superb offered a choice of a $75 voucher for future travel or a "bag-swap". In the short time from the airport to where we were staying there was an email apologizing for our inconvenience! Super service. Will recommend Westjet!

When it comes to airlines ultimately whether they are any good or not really depends upon how they act when things go bad. In the past things have gone wrong with Air Canada and I've had to fight to get a hotel and a seat on an upcoming flight in reasonable time. My flight on 3rd January from Toronto to St. John's was cancelled because of a terrible snow storm in Newfoundland. Within 30 minutes I was in a hotel with meal vouchers. On the 4th the plane was cancelled again and the same thing happened no questions asked we were all shipped off again. On the 5th WestJet had put on 2 extra planes to deal with the backlog WS 4150 and WS 4175 leaving at 7am and 8am respectively. I was on the latter plane which was a little delayed because the attendants had just come off the inbound Halifax flight. Nonetheless it was all in good humour and no one had any cause for complaint. WestJet had gone beyond what anyone could ask for to get us all home. Air Canada flights were cancelled at the same time and some of those waiting to travel have been told they can't go until Wednesday. They may well argue it's not economically possible to put on an extra plane but if WestJet can do it the flag carrier can. I read a lot of reviews here about how a plane was a bit late the seats not that comfy and the food of a not great standard. All that actually occurred on my flight but these are small things in the main. An airline needs to be judged on looking after the best needs and Westjet delivered. Will use again and look forward to it!

### Jet Airways customer review
Passengers travelling business class are looking for four things in my opinion: First peace and quiet. Jet Airways flight 9W 0118 on 31 December 2013 from Mumbai to London had two kids in the section who did not have a seat of their own and shared seating with 4 adults spread through out the cabin during the entire duration of the flight. The kids screamed the place down and ran amok throughout the cabin. I could not sleep at all on a nearly 10 hour flight. Second. The lounge experience. Lousy is the best description I can come up with. Both outward flight from London and Return flight from Mumbai lounges were shared and were poor at best. Third entertainment. My seat 11A had a non functioning screen! It was locked in a position in which nothing could be viewed. The cabin crew apologised but obviously could do nothing about it. Meal choices. Very limited. And finally cabin comfort. The cabin is laid out in herring bone fashion the fold flat bed does not accommodate a 1.85 meter man. the décor is old fashioned in beige and brown. Shame on you Jet. Old planes indifferent service and clearly unaware that there is competition on this leg. You really do not expect me to be on board your aircraft again.

### Jet Airways customer review
The food is terrible. We thought the price was good but you have to pay for everything (reserve a seat meal movies etc). Finally it's not so cheap. They are not well organized and they made us wait for a family (for an extra hour) - when we make sure to be on time. Inside the plane is dirty. It was our first experience with Westjet and I will never choose this company again. The TVs were not working coming back: with kids the flight was long!

We flew from Cancun to Toronto. You can choose self-check in at the airport or web check-in 24 hours before departure. There was a 20-min delay for boarding for unknown reason otherwise it was a smooth ride without incident. The staff were great during the flight. They came around twice with free drinks pretzels or cookies and sandwiches for purchase. Inflight entertainment was ok with 4 movies and satellite TV with quite a few channels once in Canadian air space (for about half an hour or so for our flight).

Singapore to Delhi 19th December 2013 9.30am but departed 10.45am. Check in was very slow and disorganised Between standard economy and web check in. The staff were more interested in charging customers for being overweight by 2kg. Inflight cabin crew had a not bothered attitude and had to ask for water. The service level was like a budget airline. We left late and then had to wait for 30 min upon landing at Delhi for a gate.

The service offered by Jet Airways is very disappointing I was taking a domestic flight from Bengaluru to Kolkata on 18 December 2013. When I checked-in I was told my luggage had exceeded the limit of 15kg. While I understand that such limits are imposed on domestic flights but for someone who is on a long business trip in India who has been allowed up to 20kg or 30kg on international flights how do the authorities expect us to shed off excess weight when flying from one city to the next within India? I was asked to pay for the exceeded amount at a Jet Airways counter. When I went to the counter the service was extremely slow. The counter staff were more interested in attending to the sale of tickets. Onboard there is lack of discipline by staff. People were still talking on their phone after the announcement was made not to do so. This is the second time I have flown on Jet Airways. Their lack of interest in the well being of the passengers is worrying. I will never fly Jet Airways again if I can help it.

DEL-BOM-DEL by 302/312. Both flights bang on time despite foggy conditions in Delhi. Meals adequate staff friendly. Overall a satisfying experience and would definitely recommend.

### Jet Airways customer review
Flew LHR-BOM-HKG in August and then returned on same route just before Christmas. LHR-BOM was less than 30% full resulting in a great quiet flight. Departed on time and arrived early. Bulkhead seat with lots of legroom friendly crew who even offered hot towels on departure to economy passengers because business class was so empty. In flight entertainment relatively extensive and food was okay - offered a curry meal plus a hot chicken wrap later on. Drinks were offered several times. Seat was comfortable and overall a great flight. BOM-HKG night flight was packed full. Had a seat near the back with pretty bad legroom. Served ice cream upon departure and breakfast (which was vile) before landing. Return flight a few months later to BOM was 100% full. Bulkhead seat again so leg room no problem. Entertainment and food were still pretty good and crew were as friendly as ever on Jet. The cabin was absolutely freezing though. Final flight BOM-LHR was pretty poor. Seats and entertainment still good crew still friendly. But absolutely no drinks or food offered for the first 8 hours! Breakfast eventually served but I passed having experienced the horrors of breakfast on Jet a couple of months ago. Biggest problem is Mumbai airport - the transfer process is confusing and unorganised and the airport itself is horrible. Not really Jet's fault though I guess. For the price I paid I would recommend Jet and fly with them again if they remained significantly cheaper than others on this route.

Hyderabad - Delhi - Patna a couple of days ago. Journey from Hyderabad - Delhi was fine without any issues. At Delhi airport we were informed that the 10.40 am flight would be delayed and would depart at 12.00 pm. At around 11.45 am the cancellation of the flight is announced apparently due to dense fog at Patna airport. At this point there was no Jet Konnect representative at the gate. We were directed to another gate where one representative was dealing with requests from passengers of two cancelled flights. From there we were taken to the baggage collection area and were asked if we would be interested in taking a refund or travel to Ranchi instead. We chose to travel to Ranchi. They took my boarding pass from Delhi - Patna and said that they would be giving me a Delhi - Ranchi pass. When my name was announced I see that I was handed my old Hyderabad - Delhi pass. On reaching Ranchi (4 hours after our scheduled arrival in Patna) we asked if we would get any monetary assistance for further travel to our original intended destination. These requests were shot down immediately. We had a terrible experience and won't be flying with Jet Airways again.

We flew from Brussels-Mumbai-Kolkata on 4th Nov back on 11th December 2013. Appreciated the assistance at check- in in Kolkata on 11th Dec when our flight from Kolkata-Mumbai was canceled without notice. Staff were very helpful in finding a solution and guided us to IndoAir in order to catch our flight Mumbai-Brussels. On the Mumbai- Brussels flight (seats 20D/E) the staff was very friendly helpful and polite. A diabetic meal (was ordered beforehand) that was not on board.

I fly Jet return about once a month Heathrow - Delhi - Dhaka mostly. Food is always the same (hasn't changed in 3 years) films only change every 3 months (maybe) and they are the same selection outbound and inbound. Service is average. There is zero recognition of Gold or Platinum international members loyalty (except for use of very poor below standard lounge at Delhi).

### Jet Airways customer review
I was dreading the flight from Heathrow to Mumbai to Bangkok - I'd downloaded films to my laptop and bought sandwiches in preparation for the terrible food and lack of entertainment I anticipated after reading reviews. I was so surprised how excellent the flight was! Comfortable great inflight entertainment great food (apart from the dessert) lovely service drinks whenever we wanted. For such a budget price I think it's great. On the fight from Mumbai to Bangkok we even got to lie across 3 seats to sleep. Would highly recommend for the price.

BRU-BOM on 9th of November. Pretty surprised of the high standards and professionalism of Jet Airways. Food was very tasteful well presented and plenty. On top of that we were served by an extremely friendly crew. Return flight DEL-BRU the 1st December was completely the opposite though. Before takeoff menus were distributed and you had to give your choice. I hardly had the chance to look at the menu when the rude stewardess said I had to make my choice. Once my choice made she grabbed the menu out of my hands and took it back. Food was the most terrible I ever had on a flight. The refreshment was tiny and extremely spicy and was served as good as cold. Breakfast even was worse with a few slices of tasteless unripe fruit smashed on a plate followed by a cold omelette and 2 hard cold greasy discs that were expected to be hash brown potatoes! Just as with the refreshment served earlier presentation was inexistent and looked like everything was just smashed on the plate. I told the stewardess this was the worst meal I ever had on a plane. She apologized and offered me cereals instead this was business class! The only positive point were the flat bed seats.

### Jet Airways customer review
I always hear people complain about how bad Jet's service is but this flight from BOM-BKK-BOM had a perfect on time performance for the two way trip. Food was decent nothing to special for a four hour flight and since we flew on a 737-900 jet there was common TVs throughout the flight so entertainment was hardly any but surprisingly they showed good movies on the flight. So overall experience was alright and I would recommend this airline.

### Jet Airways customer review
Flying from Bangkok to Delhi Jet Airways offers a business class on their B737 which could not even be compared to an Economy Deluxe Class in other airlines: old seats with reduced pitch lousy entertainment system (tiny overhead screens image so dark it cannot be seen) no toiletries food very average crew indifferent disappears after serving breakfast does not come back if more coffee is needed water is not offered during flight a miserable experience all in all but you can learn from experiences and so I will never fly Jet Airways again. If this is India's best airline I cannot imagine how other airlines fare.

We were very disappointed with the way Jet Connect handled our Flight cancelation and reschedule on Nov 5th. We had a flight out of Delhi FLT # 9W7125 at 8.35. We received no phone call of our flight being canceled and arrived at the airport 2 hours before. Apparently they called some passengers but not all. We then heard it was canceled after we waited in line. The best they could do was put us on a 2.30 flight. The 2.30 flight came and went no flight took off. They could not tell us anything except that it was delayed 1 hour. Then it was delayed again nobody could tell us the truth. The truth being the city the flight was originating from was delayed due to weather and had not taken off yet. Why not just tell us that and try to book us on another flight. There was much chaos at the airport and the passengers were in an uproar. Nobody was giving them answers. Finally the plane arrived and we eventually took off at 6.30. This is 10hours after our original flight we arrived at our final destination at 2am! To top if off they actually wanted to charge us for meals on the plane after waiting that long. I see this as the worst customer service ever.

Never fly Heathrow to Hyderabad connecting in Mumbai - it is too tight a connection. Flew with my 12 year old daughter after baggage reclaim two security checks check in again and baggage scans we were put on a coach to transfer to Mumbai domestic. With 25 minutes left for Mumbai Hyderabad flight I struggled to find the gates no one knew and there was no Jet staff to help. Finally waited at yet another security queue (no one paged) to arrive at wrong gate where they said I had missed the flight and should go to counters outside who would put me on a flight in next two hours - it was an absolute fish market. They said all flights were full I should buy a ticket for next day morning and make my own stay arrangements. it took me standing 6 hours of perseverence at the counter pleading without any food and with my 12 year old in tears. They initially put me on a waiting list and firmed finally with half an hour to go for the flight to Hyderabad which was a Jet Konnect no frills flight where I bought sandwiches and coffee for dinner. Not worth the hassle I want to give up my Jet Privilege membership and never fly Jet again.

My flight from Dubai to Delhi was bad in more than one way the seats were torn glass holders broken restroom dustbins pasted with tapes and no in-flight entertainment. My return flight from Delhi to Dubai was in equally shabby condition (I think it was the same plane). What was worse is that they ran out of juice in the mid of first serving. I wanted to fill out a customer feedback form but I wasn't served one.

Traveled from Dubai to Mumbai on 31st October 2013. Past experiences were very good but this time it was very bad experience as far as entertainment food and beverages are concerned. Asked Air-hostess to replace defective headset and told she would come back with replacement which never happened. Secondly Drinks served only once asked for another drink and was flatly refused. Asked for something for munching with drinks was told its finished and the most surprising part is after completion of all services when I opted to go for wash room was amazed to see team leader eating the snacks that I was told is finished. Food of average quality. Looks like the standard has reached the lowest level.

Traveled from Mumbai to London in 2005 using Jet airways. It was an excellent experience. This time again travelled from London to Mumbai and return via Delhi in September 2013. Horrible experience as far as food and beverages are concerned. Drinks served only once. Food of average quality. Looks like the standard has reached the lowest level and now Jet Airways can be compared to Air India. Had recently taken a flight through Emirates which was wonderful. Will not fly Jet anymore.

No proper food was served to the child for a journey of nearly 10 hours long.

Gold member - yes premier class - yes web check in - yes. 10 minutes delayed coming from terminal 5 to terminal 4 - already checked in but not allowed to board with more than 45 minutes to spare. Unprofessional in handling passengers and unprofessional in dealing with complaints. Got myself another full ticket on Air India as that was the only option available 2 hrs later. I fly every month and being a gold member this was not what I expected.

BKK-BOM-LHR-BOM-BKK mid-Sep and back early-Oct full/near-full on all 4 sectors but luckily the much-more- comfortable older-style 3-3-3 layout B777-300 between BOM and LHR. Food and service acceptable but LHR-BOM and BOM-BKK ran 30-mins late plus 1-hour delay at BKK-Immigration meant I was tight for time to make my onward domestic-connection. De-planing in BOM was also very slow for those of us sitting down the back how much longer until the terminal building-work is completed? Security-check in BOM on-return took an hour and that was with Jet-staff pulling us out of the queue since our onward-flight was closing!

BOM-BKK on B737 and SIN-BOM on A330. Check in was smooth and allotted requested seats. Aircraft's were clean however the A330 showed signs of ageing. Cabin crew did their jobs well and quite welcoming. Legroom limited on the B737. Adequate selection of drinks. Food served on BOM-BKK was below average while it was good on SIN-BOM. IFE selection ok considering the flights' duration. Flights were on time.

BOM-LHR 12th Sep. Jet's boarding process is probably the most orderly and efficient I have experienced. If only other airlines supported their front-line staff so that they could make sure that the aircraft was filled from the rear and time was not wasted waiting behind someone in Row 10 who took his or her time settling in. The service was good and the food excellent particularly the vegetarian option. The seat could be more comfortable: has some efficiency expert removed inches of foam to make the aircraft lighter. This could be Jet's weakest link. The baggage was on the carousel as soon as I cleared immigration which is another pointer to Jet's attention to detail and understanding of process. My only problem was that some "helpful" handlers had removed bags from the carousel and stacked them in a line on the far side without letting people know. I wasted about 40 minutes until this a handler mentioned this stack. I recognise that the baggage from a large aeroplane like a 777 could clog a carousel but better clearer visual indicators should be considered when handlers have to clear a carousel. Alternatively today's It should allow baggage to be delivered in synch with the people clearing immigration. Nevertheless I enjoyed the flight and will choose Jet again.

LHR to MAA via BOM and return. Check in at LHR I was the first to check in I told check in staff to add 'Fragile' tags to my bags! She forgot. Quite an aged aircraft the sockets are US ports same on the return leg. Flight departed on time and once airborne I was waiting for refreshments told you wont be served alcohol until you ask for it explicitly. After snacks were served flight attendants vanished! Was very hungry when they started serving lunch slowly with a round of drinks and then vanished again. Later a sandwich was offered spent most of the flight hungry. Aircraft was very cold and they ran out of additional blankets no effort was made to reduce the cooling. Staff were neutral the same facial expression throughout the flight. Luckily my bags were safe on arrival. BOM to MAA flight was good. New flight good food and on time arrival. Value for Money but no customer service.

Return journey to Amritsar via Delhi in economy class. First leg from LHR-DEL-ATQ was not impressive. They didn't give bottles of water bottles but two pouches of dairy powder and concentrated milk were given on the first leg. The return flight was enjoyable on 24th Sep and proper meals were served with water bottles. The inflight service was good apart from snacks which were served too late. They need to improve dessert. The ticket had allowance for 2 bags but website was showing only 1 bag. There is a lack of communication on the part of airline on baggage issues. The in flight entertainment was enjoyable with a good selection of movies. The transfer at Delhi for Amritsar was ok as airline didn't bother to tell us that aircraft has been delayed on first leg.

Mumbai to Hong Kong in C Class. Transfers in Mumbai are by bus so not too good. Seat configuration is herring bone. Bedding and food are very good. FAs are on the dot. The big minus point is security. No pre-flight cabin check. Some passengers seats were reclined for take off.

I traveled business class London - Mumbai and was least impressed with the dowdy looking cabin with a dark brown trim around the upholstery and an equally dreary floor carpet. There were absolutely no frills attached. The staff welcome on board was pretty ordinary the cabin crew was not a head turner in terms of uniform smartness and otherwise. It was a day flight and hence the staff did not bother to offer the complementary packs containing the usual toiletry goodies proudly given by other better known airlines. Food presentation was mediocre and I had to ask for a tooth pick as a request. Headphone sets were tucked away in a blue pouch and something that could have easily been forgotten had I not asked for one. Not much of complimentary drinks offered during the flight unless specifically asked for. Oh and the menu cards were collected at the end for re-use again. I guess not a bad think for being environmentally friendly. You get what you pay and it was the cheapest business class that was on offer.

I Was on flight from Winnipeg to Calgary on Sep 19th at 7.15 am. I dozed off I woke up later and noticed that everyone was having snacks. I approached an attendant and asked if I could get my snack. Told that they would bring me a glass of tomato juice which I asked for. This was the second flight where I encountered not so friendly staff members. Funny though is that as we landed the crew all had smiles.

Business class Mumbai-London in early August 2013 was excellent. Beyond the Indian food service which was apropos the entertainment selection was broad and great for those familiar with Indian music and film. Definitely held its own with Business Class service on east Asian airlines that tend to set the standard.

Travelled 9w64 DEL-BKK no personal video screens on this flight. Did they bring an old aircraft for this flight? Jet is proud to show its IFC. Normally I get 30kg in economy but this time only 20kg. Their website said 30kg but not reflected on ticket.

### Jet Airways customer review
Despite Westjet's incredibly high self appraisal the services I received was remarkably poor. No TV screen on the seat. If you want to watch anything you have to pay to obtain portable TV. For a 5.5 hour flight they only offered beverages twice with a tiny package of cookies or corn chips. Too much air conditioning but no blanket offered for night time flight. The most offensive service was the fact they put garbage magazines such as People or Star in the front pocket. I guess they assume all the passengers have very low IQ's to enjoy such a tasteless entertainment. This is actually 100 times worse than no entertainment. I recommend Air Canada over Westjet.

Had a ticket for a trip from Jaipur to Delhi in India at 8.35 September 3. When I wanted to check in I was informed that there was a delay of 3 hours due to "technical problems". The real reason was that there was not enough passengers for this departure so they just chose to merge this departure with the next 35 hours later. The result being that I lost my connection in Delhi and had to arrange new flight connections out of Delhi. I will never ever fly with Jet Airways.

I was flying a short flight from Montreal to Toronto and paid to pre-book my seat. Onboard the flight attendant told me he gave my seat to the family who had to sit together and he'd find me another seat. I had to stand at the washroom and wait for everyone to board. Finally got a seat 11 rows back from what I had booked. When I asked to move back upfront he gave me an option to pay $45 for the plus seat! He never apologised during this time but said "thank you for your co-operation" when I was leaving the plane! If they'd ask me prior and I agreed not a problem. In this case they did not tell you and give you no option.

LHR-DEL-MAA return. International legs from London to Delhi were both on 777-300 but the difference in service out and inbound was notable. I'm 6"2 and on the way out my legs were touching the seat in front the attendants were fine but nothing great and the food servings were really below par. The breakfast was particularly paltry. On the way back the leg room was capacious and I could stretch out with plenty of room to spare meals were healthy and decent quality with choice of western or Indian service was good with drinks served throughout the flight and they even kept the toilets clean. Couldn't fault the return leg I guess it's just luck of the draw on which plane you get. Range of movies was ok with a decent number of western and Indian to choose from. We had seats 57A&B both ways and this gave us 2 windows on the more spacious seat layout. The internal flights between Delhi and Madras were average with little leg room no IFE and they ran out of blankets though they did at least serve free food. Not up to standard of middle-Eastern carriers but they were cheapest tickets available at the time so can't complain.

BKK-DEL-LHR-DEL-BKK mid-July returning early-August with my young son who was amazed when we got an upgrade to Premiere (Business-Class) for BKK-DEL after sleeping on a couch in the airport overnight due to no connecting- flight from our home town in-time to catch Jet's 08.40 morning-departure. Well done Jet Airways! Delhi security took over an hour on the return flight not the airline's fault. IFE good and food OK for a low-cost ticket but couldn't do online check-in in UK because travelling with a Child why not? That's when you're more in need of selecting a better-located seat! Jet continues to be quite acceptable for a low-costs ticket between BKK & Europe. Wonder what changes the Etihad-shareholding will bring?

We sent our daughter a minor on a flight from Fort McMurray to Toronto to meet her Grandmother. We as parents didn't want our daughter to be alone at anytime in Toronto airport so we asked that someone from WestJet meet and assist her to the arrivals area where her grandmother was to meet her as she was flying in from saint John NB to meet her and they would fly back to saint John NB together. The problem we not only called twice to have a note put on her flight info we went directly to the airport spoke to someone at WestJet to make sure it was all there for someone to assist and meet her grandmother and they assured us it was there and someone would assist her. Well someone did assist her to arrivals which is not a secure area and left her alone. Can you imagine your minor child standing in Toronto Airport by themselves. All did end well for us.

Toronto to Cayo Coco and Cayo Coco to Toronto. 2504 and 2505 July 6th and August 3rd. Everything was very good on the flight except the entertainment system but it being a very short flight it did not bother me. Flight crew extremely friendly and accommodating. The seat could be a little wider and being seated in the aisle seat my arm was bumped several times from people walking by. There just wasn't enough room. This happened when I was using the armrest console for entertainment selections etc. Other than this they were both great flights.

Flew SIN-DEL just last month. The Business Class was out so I was stuck with economy. It was awful. The plane looks horrible the cabin was noisy headphones barely audible and the meal tasted bland. The FAs looked like they're on a bad mood or something because the "threw" the meal to me instead of serving it nicely. The English announcement need improvement as well. The legroom was also not enough as I'm 5'7". For a 5 hour flight it was overall horrible.

LA to Vancouver in premium economy. Due to a hand injury I asked a flight attendant to assist me with lifting my carry-on luggage to the overhead bin. The flight attendant was unwilling to help and replied that she also had a hand injury. When I asked her again she offered to check my luggage. I declined her offered and explain that my luggage is not heavy but due to a hand injury I have limited range of hand motion and showed her the hand with the hand brace on. She replied again that she also had a hand injury and just stood there. It wasn't until I asked her for another flight attendant to help me that she suggested that we put the luggage up together. I was polite and respectful throughout the entire conversation was surprised at the level of service I was receiving. I will not fly with them again.

Outbound Toronto (YYZ) - Liberia (LIR) July 19 2013 Flight 2742 Boeing 737-700. Return Liberia (LIR) - Toronto (YYZ) July 26 2013 Flight 2743. West Jet has One of our worst experiences yet. Firstly they noted we had to upgrade our seating to sit next to each other having to pay more because only front seats were available. Rather than just being seated in any back row told not a single seat was left but the front ones even though we had booked our flight months in advance. Had to pay almost an extra hundred for our seats. Also they do not offer any earphones for use and they offer very little channels to watch during flight. They also don't offer any meals you have to buy everything. You are only offered a drink (water pop or coffee/tea) and a biscuit. We were extremely disappointed having to pay the extra hundred for our flight!

YEG-YYZ July 30 2013. Flew Air Canada from Toronto to Edmonton and returned with Westjet. Both flights were full. AC flight on time and the crew business like and professional. Return flight with Westjet was delayed a half hour because they could not get a ramp to the departure gate. No apology - just a curt comment from the first officer that 'we hope that your travel plans were not disrupted'. The in flight entertainment system on AC was better and the food for purchase on AC was better. In short our Westjet experience was nothing special.

LHR - BKK (via BOM and return via DEL) Ok flight ok IFE. Seat not very comfortable. Poor meals for long haul flights.

### Jet Airways customer review
Found customer service staff friendly and helpful. However plane comfort and seating were poor. Not only is the seat pitch as close to as small as it can be but seat depth is short and feels like you are sitting on a hockey bench not on an airplane. Armrests are so short your elbows will hardly touch. Satellite TV was provided but half the channels did not come through clearly or were static and the screens were very tiny.

Delhi to London on 24th July. Plane was hot and stuffy when we boarded but thought this would improve once the engines were started. Once in the air it became apparent that the air conditioning was not working! Several passengers complained and were told that the air conditioning had to be reset and would improve within 30 minutes 3 or 4 hours into the flight the pilot finally came on to say that they had a technical fault with the air conditioning but that they we would see a difference in 30 minutes. By this point everyone on board was sweating and very grumpy. The plane was roasting hot the whole way. The stewards did give out several more drinks than normal and an ice cream to everyone but the temperature was unbearable. In total I was travelling for 26 hours With this being the longest flight which made me and my travelling companions totally exhausted.

Mumbai to Bangalore return flight. Check-in in Bombay was good with a dedicated line for Web check in passengers. Flight on time to Bangalore and the emergency exit row seats were great. On the way back flight was early. Good service on board. Food was okay. The only problem was the check-in at Bangalore. A huge queue. Took 30 mins to get to a desk. There were 2 staff to check-in all passengers while there were 2 just for hand bag only passengers and 2 for premier - and both those queues had only a few people.

Flight 9w531 from DXB to IXE on B737-800. Ground staff at DXB airport were not polite to travelers. Rest was all fine with the airline. Fresh cabin pleasant air crew on time service and clean seats. The options on drinks and food are very limited. Overall above average.

Flew IXE-DXB on a B737-800 with winglets. Extremely delighted with surprise upgrade to business class by the airline staff. Enjoyed the flight with good recliner seats & extra leg room. Food quality just remains lagging compared with Air India. Pleasant experience.

### Jet Airways customer review
IXZ-CCU-DEL on a JetKonnect flight. Nothing much to write about as it was a low-cost flight. Seats were a bit cramped and the cleanliness could have been better. Aircraft wasn't exactly old but on the way. No IFE but a decent inflight magazine. Food options had run out thanks to the incoming flight so we had to wait till CCU to get something vegetarian to eat that was not a bag of crisps. Crew was cold and to-the-point but courteous still. Some memorable lapses in their English speaking skills. Flight was bumpy thanks to bad weather but other airlines have managed the same in a far better manner. However we managed to reach our destination half an hour ahead of schedule. Not a bad flight per se but at the prices we paid other airlines offer far better value (read Air India).

Toronto to Victoria on July 10 2013. Only TV on the plane that didn't work was mine! Attendant came and tapped it a few times and nothing but showed no real concern its only a 5 hour flight!! We were row 5 I had specifically picked those seats and paid extra for them but at the time they were not deemed 'undesirable' unfortunately now they were and when the row in front reclined we lost use of our trays and the only 1 TV that was working which we were sharing! It was a bad situation and a horrible flight. When the food and beverage services started I passed the attendant my visa and asked to run a tab the other attendant said it wouldn't be any charge for my cheese platter due to the problems we were having with that the attendant said 'now are you happy'. I fly regularly on Westjet and have noticed a change from before certainly not going to be my go to airline anymore getting the poor service is one thing upsetting my daughter due to complete ignorance is another.

### Jet Airways customer review
Vancouver to Los Angeles. If you ever decide to fly with WestJet expect flight delays and paying for your food onboard. Make sure you bring some warm clothes because you will have to pay $3 for a blanket. The only positive thing about them is that they don't charge you for your first piece of luggage. No inflight entertainment unless again (you pay for it). Basically nothing for free except coffee and drinks.

Traveled to Fort Lauderdale from Toronto to take a cruise flight down was ok coming back though our flight was suppose to leave at 11.55am. At 12.55pm there was still no ground crew no announcements and not a single person in sight to ask what was going on. At 1.45pm I found another Westjet ground crew at a different gate they had no idea what was happening. We finally boarded over 2 hours late - no explanation - no apologies and when I emailed Westjet about it the response was that they source out ground crews - so they are not really responsible.

BLR-BOM-RUH return. Flights to and from RUH delayed by 20 minutes. Aircraft's were quite clean but starting to show their age. No personal IFE on BOM-RUH which was surprising. Personal IFE on RUH-BOM had a decent selection of Bollywood and Hollywood movies. Cabin crew efficient. Snacks and breakfast good though portions are small. Quality of Indian dinner served is quite bad when compared to other Middle eastern airlines even though Jet is an Indian carrier!

Round-trip from Toronto to New York City on June 28/13 returning July 1/2013. WJ 1216 on June 28 and WJ 1217 on July 1st. We experienced flight delays on both our arrival and departure. This had nothing to do with WestJet as the delay was initiated by the airport. The flight crew made every effort to make the delay as comfortable as possible. Given food vouchers without even requesting it. Flight crew had been working over 12 hours and were still friendly and cheerful. Despite the 6.5 hour delay for a 1.5 hour flight it was still an overall pleasant experience.

Was booked Victoria to Calgary leaving at 7am. Got to airport to find flight delayed by one hour and my connecting flight cancelled until following day. Later found out I had received an email notification at home at 6.27am. I was supposed to be at the airport by 6. Fortunately a very good ticket agent rescheduled me with a partner carrier but through different routing.

IXE-BOM-DEL on Boeing 737-800. Both legs on-time was assisted by ground staff at Mumbai as it was a tight connection: so could do away with another security check. Food however was below average: Air India scores in this respect. Cabin crew attentive. Overall recommended.

### Jet Airways customer review
My husband and I flew from Berlin to Toronto via Brussels and return. Flying in a new A330-300 we were very pleased with the seat configuration to allow us to sit next to each other rather than the pod configuration. The lay flat seats were extremely comfortable. From the moment we boarded the staff were very polite and wishing to please. The menu selection had both Asian and Western entrees and we were not disappointed. The only think lacking was the quality of the night bag given to us as it did not have any ear plugs or eye shades for the night flight.

Booked return flight Delhi-Amritsar. Both the flights were delayed by around 4 hours. The return flight delay caused me to miss my connecting flight. The cabin crew and the staff at the airport were extremely rude and refused help of any kind. Talking around the Delhi airport it seems this is common occurrence for Jet Airways - almost all their flights are delayed.

### Jet Airways customer review
DXB-BOM on a Boeing 737 VT-JBX. Aircraft equipped with Boeing Sky Interior so I was surprised that Jet's seats have remained the same as the old Jet livery. Greeted formally through reluctance and without a warm welcome by the onboard supervisor and was met with a confused demeanour coupled with mild exasperation when I waited to be directed to my seat. It seemed only a few of the passengers were offered newspapers before take off - one needed to ask for this. Once in the air the IFE system seems remarkably limited but playback works well - though headgear needs to be updated. The food was tasty but lacking in quantity - though the appetizer was well- received. It was interesting that the male steward was much more warm and friendly than either of the female ones. Staff service was professional but one felt awkward expecting them to be more welcoming than they were - this could be easily remedied. Good choice of beverages on board. Jet remains value for money but must be very careful not to allow its high standards to begin slipping due to a few mediocre members of cabin crew. This journey was a mixed bag more than anything else - Jet is more than capable of delivering a better product.

PNQ-BOM-LHR-DEL-PNQ. Jet Airways continues to slide in just about all aspects. What once used to be a premium global carrier is now nothing more than a 2 star airline. Seat configuration on LHR sector to 3-4-3 has made seats very cramped. Food is distasteful aircraft's are unclean landings on all sectors was rough.

### Jet Airways customer review
Flew DEL-BOM-DEL. Air conditioning turned on only after reaching cruise altitude and turned off when landing. Food was pathetic service average. Sufficient seating space at the gate. Check in was smooth. Note that there is no baggage drop counter at Delhi airport. If there is one it wasn't clearly visible. Bombay airport was good.

### Jet Airways customer review
BKK-BOM-LHR-DEL-BKK in May in Economy. Flights from/to BKK were their B737-900 which was full and had no seat- back IFE only drop-down screens with the same film both ways. Cabin-crew worked hard to serve drinks and a good meal hampered by the usual queue for the loos and passengers wandering up and down to visit friends. The B777-300ERs on longer flights into/from LHR were clean but the new 3-4-3 seating is much more cramped than 3-3-3 last year especially as I was given an exit-row seat (50C) on the return-flight this was so narrow (due to control-panel reducing space and hard-sides instead of armrests) that I had to literally wedge myself into it ! Luckily the cabin-crew helped me change seats when asked. Web check-in was not available for the return trip. Hopefully the new tie-up with Etihad may eventually lead to seat-selection becoming available when booking or pre-travel not just (if it works) with web check-in! No lounge-access offered for any of the 4 airports despite Silver ff-status but a welcome extra 10 kgs hold-allowance. Overall the trip was OK good value-for money DEL stopover was fine and BOM security/terminal remains its usual mess not the airline's fault. Roll-on the new terminal still under-construction ! I'd recommend them to others on-a-budget and have booked myself for two more trips this year also for my sons flying the same route.

I keep traveling Jet Airways and usually it's ok but the planes are old. I flew RUH-BOM-KTM. We approached KTM and were told the weather was too bad to land. So we went to Lucknow and waited. Then flew back to KTM just to return to Lucknow once again. We waited and waited. Finally they told us we were going back to BOM KTM doesn't have night landings which I soon found out to be untrue. Chaos ensued at BOM because we couldn't leave the airport because of no visa for India. We slept on the floor in the lounge. This was the worst experience I have had with Jet. Usually they are fine. I'm flying on them again in 2 weeks. Wish me luck!

### Jet Airways customer review
Unfortunately I had to travel with Jet Airways to Brussels it was the only flight I could find to catch my connecting flight in Paris. The plane was very old and clearly wasn't cleaned properly because there was hair on my seat. Secondly staff were not very friendly or helpful. I am a young female travelling alone and whenever I asked for assistance it appeared as if I was bothering the staff. I pressed the assistance button and no one came. The only positive was that I could charge my phone during my flight.

### Jet Airways customer review
Starting from the check-in counters at BOM which were overcrowded and short of space. There wasn't enough seating space at the gate. Flight delayed with no reason given. Half the passengers were boarded on buses which stayed at the gate for around 30 min without moving. Turned out the airplane had a fault. Some passengers had confusion with seat allocations. Poor leg space and no inflight entertainment. Departed over an hour late. Did not serve the VLML meal that had been requested. The Fruit Platter meal only had one serving of fruit the rest was the same as other meals. They do not load enough pillows and blankets for all seats so get yours before other passengers realize. All in all totally avoidable.

### Jet Airways customer review
We recently flew Jet Airways from New Delhi to Nepal and back. Ground staff were terrible and were completely confused that we had 2 extra bags. We told them repeatedly to just tell us how much extra we needed to pay. The worst was coming back from Nepal. We were put in a holding area in New Delhi. The staff would shout "You go sit for 30 minutes. We were not told why. Finally told that Air France agent would be there in an hour to talk to us about the extra bags. He came after over an hour but didn't know what to do. After 2 hours we paid. I asked for a receipt and was told I could get one at the gate. I didn't try to get it as was afraid that it would cause another big wait. People were being sent back to the agent because he didn't put his name on the ticket or didn't circle the flight. I just wanted out of there. Then 2 of the bags were sent to Salt Lake City (We live in Nashville) with a different name. Thankfully the tags were right and we received them the next day! Never again!

London-Bangkok via Mumbai and back. I cannot find words to describe how bad this airline is - the staff poor food inedible and as for the transfer in Mumbai lets just say I would never step foot in that airport again.

The seats were a little cramped but otherwise it was ok after take off my TV was not working so I told the flight attendant and she said she would reset it that happened 5 times then she said there was nothing she could do about it. I have taken this route several times and they give the same food. I was not satisfied with my flight even though it was very cheap.

Flew BLR-BOM-DXB return on B737s. All flights on time except BOM-BLR which was delayed 20 minutes. Aircraft interiors clean and well maintained. Leg space was quite ok though it was a bit difficult to get into a comfortable position. Flight attendants did their job efficiently one of them on the DXB-BOM leg was cheerful and interacted very well with the passengers. Food was awful on the DXB-BOM flight and above average on others. Portions were small. Entertainment system on the DXB-BOM flight conked off and was reset but did not work properly.

Flew Bangalore - Coimbatore return. On the way out I got the newest Boeing 737 they had which was fabulous. Although the flight was just 30 minutes long they managed to come around and serve us sandwiches and drinks. The crew were excellent. Return was on the ATR. Flight was good though the quality of Buy on board meals has to increase a lot to match the quality expected. Both flights left ahead of time and arrived well ahead of scheduled arrival.

### Jet Airways customer review
Return flight Singapore and Delhi. SIN to Delhi leg was pleasant not great. Delhi to Singapore was awful. Food was poor but the clincher must be when they raised the air-conditioning temperature because they ran out of blankets. For a 5 hour long red-eyed flight where you would be trying to get some sleep it was hot. Crew were unable to help as they said that passengers felt cold and there were insufficient blankets to go around. First time on Jet Airways and last. Only thing salvageable were the crew.

SYD-AKL evening flight. I'm sure the seats have been moved even closer. I am big but I don't think I have grown taller over the last 10 months. I had to sit with legs apart not enough room to put knees together. Flight only 3 hours so was not bad considering the price. The 1 bag 10kg carry on not enforced making for very slow loading and off loading. Only one surly staff member.

### Jet Airways customer review
I'm a frequent flyer on SIN-DEL-SIN route. While the in-flight service and the crew have been impeccable the plane quality has deteriorated. Travelled couple of times earlier last year on A330 with quite a lot of leg space (which is good for me considering I'm 6'1'') but they stopped it in between. Now they are back to the Boeing 777 with 3-3 configuration with cramped seats. Taking the night flight out of SIN after a long work day makes the whole journey painful. Plus if its code sharing with Qantas flight from Australia (which they do quite often) the plane becomes cramped up with long lines for toilets. Hope they bring back the A330 on the route.

### Jet Airways customer review
Terrible experience today. Missed a connection from Kona due to a "mechanical issue" that was actually not an issue. Then had to be driven from Vancouver airport to Abbotsford with 100 other similarly inconvenienced people. 7 hours late and this is not the worst experience I've had with this formerly good airline this year. Made passengers pay $17 for entertainment "Tablet computer" because plane had not been upgraded with the live TV's - which are a major part of their advertising campaign.

### Jet Airways customer review
I travelled from SIN-DEL-SIN. Small plane. Not enough leg room. Crew were doing their best given circumstances. Lavatories awful. There were only 2 on the return. One non operational on both flights. With one lavatory operational there was long queue in the aisle. My kids were also booked to fly on Jet Airways domestic flight. It was cancelled twice on the day. 7am flight from DEL to CHD ended up being 4pm flight for a mere 30 minutes journey.

A few days ago Toronto was hit with a massive storm and all flights into Pearson had been cancelled. Westjets customer service and the way they handled the situation was excellent. They put all passengers up in a hotel for the night provided taxis and even passed out food vouchers. As this was a weather circumstance this was not expected. Fantastic service.

Vancouver to Ottawa via Toronto. Late departure but we made up the flying time. I flew in from Asia on business class and had a bit of a shock sliding into my rather small seat with the 3 seats full - but as the red eye flight was not full was able to move forward and had more space - a 4 hour flight in that tight space of 3 is a bit much. Plane looked a bit tired - needs a spruce up. Price was right though. I forgot how small the TV screens are and limited movie choices. Free snacks were nice and cabin service good. Looking forward to economy plus seating in the future.

### Jet Airways customer review
Pleasantly surprised with my flight. Plane was clean staff friendly. The food was lovely. Drinks were hard to get and you had to ask for alcohol but once you had it it was fine.. One thing I would say needed improvement was the toilets. There were not enough and constantly a long line up (on my Mumbai - Bangkok flight it was half the length of the plane!) and this was made worse by the flight attendants trying to get through with their trolleys. There was also only one choice of film on this flight more entertainment options would have been appreciated. Other than that I enjoyed my flights.

Outgoing flight to Mumbai was ok - attentive cabin crew and food was a good standard. Connecting flight to Bangkok nowhere near as good as the earlier flight. Food not very nice. Return flight from Bangkok to Mumbai - very poor cabin crew - I asked for water several times and it never arrived. The attitude of one of the female attendants was unacceptable! The food was awful some sort of omelette. Seats very worn and terrible vibration. The connecting flight to Heathrow was slightly better but I just wanted to get home. I would not recommend Jet airways and will avoid using them again. On the plus side the take off and landings were very smooth.

### Jet Airways customer review
I really want to be a WestJet fan but it's just getting harder and harder. Their in-flight entertainment was a great idea for a small regional carrier but does not work that far away from Canada. All staff used to be very well trained and knowledgeable. We were recently asked to re-pack because 2 of our cases where 1 pound overweight. I forethought I should have insisted to just pay the overage and had them do the paperwork. My daughter likes the soup they serve but there's about a 50% chance they will run out. Prices have risen as well as service charges. Aside from a couple most of the staff have great attitudes and that is refreshing but really it seems as though that about all the have left going for them anymore.

### Jet Airways customer review
BKK-CCU Economy Class. The flight was full and passengers seemed to have an extraordinarily large amount of hand luggage - this made it seem fuller. Boarding was on-time and efficient notwithstanding the extra security checks just before the aerobridge (no fault of Jet Airways). Lunch was okay though disappointing that for an almost three hour flight there was no bar service (beers offered). Seat pitch on the 737 was okay. Jet Airway's IFE is now pretty inadequate - the touch-screen means that if you have an eager passenger behind you then you can feel your seat being poked throughout the flight! The plane was quite dirty - and the leather seats are beginning to crack and look tatty.

### Jet Airways customer review
Flying constantly from Regina to Vancouver I have never had any problems. I make that flight maybe every 5 weeks or so and I have yet to be disappointed. My last flight was from Chicago into Calgary and even at my lowest moment when I thought I was going to miss my flight the WestJet agents were so helpful that I made it to my flight with time remaining still.

I was scheduled on a flight from Abbotsford BC to Cagary AB. When we got to the Abbotsford airport we were informed that all planes had been grounded since last night. My flight was scheduled for 5 am and the next possible flight was at 6pm in the evening. I was going to lose one day of a weekend with my son. Westjet staff offered to get me on a flight leaving from Vancouver that morning and then arranging a taxi at their expense to get me to the Vancouver airport on time. I only lost 2 hrs of time. I am very impressed.

New Delhi - Dubai - New Delhi 2 Passengers. We arrived at check-in 2 hours early yet we were given seats in the last row of the plane. They were so uncomfortable yet one still has to pay the same for them. Our seats were non reclining and you are barely left with space to breath when the seat in front reclines. One of our seat's entertainment screen wasn't working there was no one to fix it in spite of complaining. Other problems included crying babies stench of the toilet people shouting arguing with the attendants for alcohol beyond the allowed limit queues outside the toilet throughout and passengers ignoring the seat belt sign. I've given the staff service good reviews since they tried their best to manage things. However they could not do much with the overall quality of resources. Neither plane nor services were international quality.

Round trip to Las Vegas from Edmonton. I was very surprised how neglected the cabin was. The seats were not clean the seat pockets not clean dirt on carpet bathroom not clean.

DEL-HYD-BOM-DEL. Each flight delayed by more than an hour due to 'weather in Delhi' though all other airlines operating on time. Received SMS that the flights were delayed 10 min before boarding which is useless. On board service spotty with the crew more concerned about applying makeup and chatting. You get a tiny cup of water and that's it - have to pay for everything else. Planes have clearly had rows of seats added as there is little to no space between rows. The worst part however was the ground staff. Check in at BOM with rude and uninformed agents who could not checks bag onto ANA codeshare flight to NRT which resulted in a 2 hour ordeal at DEL to get back go through security wait for check in counter to open and recheck bag in again. This airline has gone downhill - will use Indigo next time.

Short flight from Toronto to Ottawa and back. Outbound flight departed 15 mins late on a Boeing 737-600. Very clean comfortable seats with ample legroom. Cabin staff were friendly attentive and offered all guests a complimentary glass (of your choice) Beer Wine Juice or soft drink along with either cookies or crackers. Flight was quick landed in Ottawa 10 mins early. Inbound leg was a bit more difficult. Had to fly back a day early. Arrived at Ottawa airport and went to the WestJet Counter to change the date on my ticket. Agent was very helpful. She waived the 'Change of Itinerary' fee of $50. Had to pay $42 difference in the fare which wasn't a bad trade off. B737-700 on the way back. Flight left on-time arrived in Toronto 5 mins late due to traffic congestion. Again staff were excellent and the complimentary service was greatly appreciated.

SIN-BOM-LHR-DEL-SIN. Chose Jet for the price and economy seat pitch. The 32 inch economy seating pitch really helps when you are 6 ft 5. The inflight service is very funny to watch. You will get a choice of curry or curry (vegetarian or non vegetarian) for your meal unless you pre-order what they call a 'bland' (western) meal. At every port the check in staff seemed to be under trained over zealous and the whole experience was simply 'bums on seats now'. However if you want a cheap mostly satisfying flight I can recommend Jet Airways.

LHR-BOM on newly configured B777-300. Terrible. Reconfigured to 3-4-3 there is really not enough width to sit comfortably and the still advertised foot rests have been removed. Under seat is also filled with obstacles to stretching out which all makes for a most uncomfortable flight. Flight attendants were hiding from customers pre-flight as they seem to be bored of all the complaints - they didn't even do a seatbelt check. Food passable in flight entertainment is actually reasonable. But overall a great disappointment.

### Jet Airways customer review
Staff are the helpful and friendly. The price we paid was very reasonable and we also liked the idea of a direct flight out of Victoria. Our only difficulty was requesting a Washington chair. We got to the ticket counter at the airport and asked if the request was in the computer and were assured it was. We went upstairs to the departure gate and it was no where to be found. Somehow the request was lost between the check-in counter and the departure gate. The person in charge at the gate desk couldn't find the chair. We had to wait but finally someone brought a chair and we got on last.

We have to use Westjet to get out of Kamloops most times they are always late whether you are flying to Calgary or coming in from Calgary. I am waiting for my wife to arrive from Calgary and she was supposed to land at 7.53 pm. She is now scheduled to arrive at 9.55 pm if she makes it at all. The weather has now turned bad so I expect to hear that they will not be able to land. This is a common everyday occurrence and I am sick of it.

BKK-BOM-LHR-DEL-BKK in September. Cheap tickets in sale gave good vale-for-money but food/service/aircraft-cleanliness has deteriorated in the past year. Security and dirty-terminal at BOM continues to let the Jet-experience down especially compared to DEL on the way back hope they will switch to what appears to be a new terminal under-construction? Late check-in at LHR-T4 due to multiple-closures of the M25 was dealt-with efficiently and I just made the plane which was parked at the far-end of the building. Despite qualifying for Silver-FF on Jet-Privilege early-September I'm still waiting on my card/upgrade-pack hope they'll improve next year!

Flew from Saskatoon to Orlando this month. Every flight left a minimum of 30 minutes late! Was given the wrong gate number on my boarding pass and almost missed my connection on the way home because of it. But in this instance the flight leaving late yet again worked in my favor so that I wasn't stuck in the airport overnight. Boarding process is kind of a free for all. Other airlines will allow boarding from the back of the plane forward so as not to cause all the passengers to try to board at once. Very disappointed in WestJet and I will be looking at different/more reliable airlines from now on.

Flew from Toronto YYZ to Vancouver YVR return. Staff were friendly but the entertainment system was a nightmare the same movies both ways and not many choices. Whenever I moved my TV up or down it would go black. The screens are tiny. They didn't seem to notify me that snacks were coming and just passed me by. I will choose Air Canada next time.

JFK-BRU-MAA later followed by LHR-BOM. The JFK-BRU leg of the flight was quite pleasant with the entertainment system (JetScreen) working perfectly. Their new A330-200s had a well-cleaned cabin as well as well-designed seats. Flying from BRU-MAA I would actually say that it was better than the first segment with better food and crew. First flight was on time the second horribly delayed. Flying from BOM-LHR was one of the worst experiences I had had on Jet Airways flying their 777-300. The entertainment worked horribly as well as the fact that the crew were rude and inhospitable. Other than that the flight was fine. I would recommend Jet Airways as a wonderful combination of Western efficiency and Eastern hospitality!

### Jet Airways customer review
We reached the Toronto airport 3 hours before departure so we could get a good seat. Staff were rude and unfriendly. We requested a seat as far away from the washroom as possible. Onboard the seats that we got were next to the washroom. This is the last time we will be flying Jet.

### Jet Airways customer review
On Dec 19 our flight from Phoenix was weather delayed for 2 hours this resulted in missing our connection in Calgary to Comox. No seats available to Comox until Dec 28. By the time we landed in Calgary WJ had booked us to Kelowana that night and to Victoria the next night. They covered us for all meals hotel and taxis. We arrived home 30 hours late but they got us here. They made the best of a bad situation and I consider it excellent service.

### Jet Airways customer review
CCU-DEL. Reached Kolkata airport 50 mins before flight departure there was a long queue at the counters with no announcements or arrangements to give priority to passengers with upcoming flights. Staff rude and unfriendly. When I reached the front of the lie they didn't allow me to board as they had closed the boarding. I had to book next flight and wait 3 hrs. Really bad management by the staff.

### Jet Airways customer review
Our flight from Las Vegas to Edmonton was delayed several hours. No explanation given to us. The seats were quite average/uncomfortable. The entertainment system at my seat didn't work for the entire flight. However crew members were very nice. Not sure why the delay happens this often.

### Jet Airways customer review
I was flying WJ144 from Fort Mac to Edmonton on a weekly basis. I chose this flight because it suited my schedule but I can say that this flight has been anything but convenient. It has been late ever single time. I was told that this flight originates in Saskatoon and stops in Calgary and Edmonton before it gets to Fort Mac; and the delay increases at every stop. I would not recommend this flight to anyone.

### Jet Airways customer review
Calgary to Cancun. Check in was quick. All staff we encountered on the ground and in the air were friendly and helpful. Plane took off a little late but we landed in Cancun 5 min early. We didn't purchase any snacks on board only water and ate complimentary cookies and Bits and Bites. Newly released movies were nice but a guide as to which movie was playing on each channel would be nice. I think there were 4 movies in all.

Jet Konnect evening service from Chennai to Coimbatore. Flight originating from Kolkata. Had to wait near the ramp for close to 10 minutes after boarding the bus as cabin cleaning was in progress. Once boarded FA's were efficient in ensuring that all passengers take their seats without any delay. They had a passenger relocated to another seat from his existing one near the emergency exit as he could not understand English or Hindi and they could not communicate the procedure of opening the emergency door to him. Smooth take off and landing. Overall good value for money.

### Jet Airways customer review
Currently sitting at terminal 2 LAX waiting to return to Vancouver on a flight that was supposed to leave at 7.30 but has been delayed to 9.15. This on top of the fact we were not only charged the extra baggage fee for second bag but an additional $50 for oversize. That being our bike bags which are streamlined sleek and weigh approximately 20 pounds each. Our flight last Tuesday morning from Vancouver was also delayed an hour and a half but at least they didn't charge the oversize fee in addition to the second bag fee. The reason for the delay here as explained by the very unsympathetic Westjet supervisor is they are re-fitting the aircraft. Hard to understand why we should be paying for that with our time.

### Jet Airways customer review
1.5 hour delay. The first story was weather delays. That didn't pass muster so then it was passenger delays 20 passengers were delayed and wouldn't be able to get out of one of the departure locations for two days so they held the flight and there were head winds on another flight that day. Couldn't get their story straight. It all adds up to obfuscation and lack of reliability. As one passenger said if you advertise a schedule you should do your very best to keep to it.

### Jet Airways customer review
Delhi-Mumbai-Delhi return in Y class. Check in and bag drop off at airport was fine but staff was not friendly and helpful. They did their job but nothing special. Boarding was smooth and quick in flight service was fine but again nothing special food was pretty average. There is no IFE for 2 hours flight. bag was arrived on time. If you can manage your expectation and understand this airline will take you from A to B nothing more than that then it is your airline.

### Jet Airways customer review
Flew to Costa Rica on a very competitively priced flight. Outbound from Toronto to Liberia was excellent with great service from cabin crew. Inbound was a different story in that over the period of a flight lasting 5 hours +  there were no sandwiches available. Cabin crew still excellent but bitty snacks not good enough on this flight. Poor organisation.

### Jet Airways customer review
Few things upset me with my recent flights on WestJet. Went to Dominican Republic and back. Onboard televisions offered only about 4 channels (movies) - regular channels didn't work at all. When leaving the Dominican I specifically asked for a window seat on the left side of the aircraft so as to be able to see the Turks and Caicos islands. Got a wall seat (no window) on the right side of the plane! Tried to check in online the day before and the airport (POP - Puerto Plata) will not come up on the drop-down window so you cannot check in online. This resulted in waiting lines when bus loads of people all arrive at the same time and it clearly overwhelms the counter staff who don't know their left from their right. Disappointed.

### Jet Airways customer review
We flew from Victoria on Nov 10 returning 17th. Flight down was late and ran out of food - overheard flight attendants complaining about lack of stores onboard. The 2.5 hour wait through immigration was outside of Westjet's control. Return flight was delayed 4 sandwiches for the entire cabin we were in row 10 and the last two bottles of white wine were gone on the first pass. The worst was the high cabin temperature. While the staff tried the plane was not equipped properly.

20 Nov 2012. Connected from BA flight onto Westjet flight from Toronto to Winnipeg at 18.30. Although flight was delayed for 40 min we were informed about delay at all times by staff at the gate and flight deck explained reason for the delay and gave apologies for it. Cabin crew friendly attentive and professional which was very pleasant to see. Legroom on board of the aircraft is very generous and seat comfortable. Will certainly fly with them again.

### Jet Airways customer review
DEL-PNQ Economy Class. After pre-reserving a window seat I was told rudely on request at boarding that 'only middle seats were available'. Only after much insistence with the sour-faced check-in attendant and asking several times to speak with the check-in supervisor was at least an aisle seat made available to me. Then I was told that as my luggage was 23 kgs I would have to pay for excess. It seemed to me that this was punishment for my causing a fuss. Inflight it seems to me that Jet Airways once nice planes are tired cramped and in desperate need of a refurbishment. In-flight service the service was okay but not what it was once. I have enjoyed flying with Jet Airways in the past but will now look into Indigo and Spicejet for domestic Indian flights.

### Jet Airways customer review
LHR-BOM-BKK 4th Nov 2012. Flight 2 hours late departing plane not very clean and entertainment system faulty. Food terrible and crew service not up to international standards. Toilets ran out of facial tissues and were dirty obviously not checked on during the flight. Information on our late arrival not available. At BOM no pier so stairs and bus to Terminal. Onward flight rescheduled so made it to Bangkok where Bangkok Airways flight also held for us for onward to Koh Samui. On arrival at Koh Samui our luggage did not arrive due to inefficiency of Jet Airways.

### Jet Airways customer review
Flew Business Class on YYZ-BRU-MAA on 9/10 Nov. YYZ-BRU was ok. BRU-MAA was not up to satisfaction. No priority boarding at BRU. No aerobridge at MAA and the business class passengers get crushed with the economic class passengers on the bus ride from the aircraft to the terminal. No Priority baggage delivery. I was probably the last one to get my priority luggage. No wonder they have cancelled the MAA-BRU flight.

### Jet Airways customer review
Flew from Halifax to the Philippines with my Partner and my 2 year old daughter. Flight from Halifax to Toronto was with WestJet under the umbrella of Korean Air Lines. Had a valid ticket for my daughter but WestJet did not allow her to take the flight from Halifax to Toronto because she was 2 years old and needed a ticket with a seat. Korean Air did let us fly without problem from Toronto to the Philippines because on the trip to Canada she was below two. We had a valid ticket for my daughter. Because WestJet took us off the flight in Halifax we have lost all of our connecting flights. Customer service is very bad. Flight attendants are very unprofessional as is the service at the counter. Will not fly again.

November 10/12 Victoria to Cancun. First time flying WestJet. Bare bones 6hr flight with 3hr line up at Cancun customs too many WestJet flights arriving at the same time. Poor scheduling. Will think twice before flying again.

I flew LHR-DEL-BOM-TRV-BOM-DEL-LHR on 777-300 for the intercontinental legs and 737-800 for the domestic legs. Every single flight arrived early the condition of the planes was immaculate and the food fantastic. The in flight entertainment on the 777-300 was above industry standard and the service was always professional. Jet Airways are also far cheaper than British Airways internationally. An excellent experience all round.

### Jet Airways customer review
Flew from Victoria BC Canada to Cancun and flew back two weeks later. Friendly service. On time Plenty of luggage allowance. Food minimal and had to be paid for except a tiny snack. Drinks - two soft drinks free - 6 hr flight! Main complaint - long flight - two films only. (So 3 hrs no entertainment). Then amazingly same films on the way back. Flight was not cheap. Boasted of satellite TV did not work in either direction and I suspect it never does. Disappointed to say the least.

### Jet Airways customer review
This is not the same airline I flew years ago. The service is poor the stewardess seem more interested in selling headsets and stale food then bring a coffee over the bad jokes are also getting old and the 1.5 hour late departure was the topper. When I asked why? I was told bad weather but when we got on board the pilot told us it maintenance issue can't ever get their lies straight. Will not fly with them anymore.

Our vacation was hijacked by Hurricane Sandy so we couldn't believe it when on our way back to the west coast we ended up in a blizzard in Calgary. Our flight was delayed almost 5 hours. Instead of leaving at 9pm we finally left at 1.45 am. WestJet passed out food vouchers water information. They even turned down the lights in certain areas of the waiting room for people trying to sleep. Everyone was friendly and helpful. Once on the plane the captain came out and explained what was going on. Good going WestJet!

Flew from Kamloops to Calgary and then on to Ottawa and back. Staff were kind and helpful! Bought a cheese plate to snack on. Was offered plenty of beverages and snacks throughout the flight. Staff added some humour to their pre flight announcements and got the passengers to participate. Plane was clean inflight entertainment was pretty good. I will definitely fly WestJet again!

Not the first time this has happened to me since I started flying Westjet to Hawaii. Due to depart at 10.05 on Thursday Nov 1/12 to Honolulu. We arrived at Vancouver airport to find it had been delayed to 4.40pm. We were not prepared to go home so waited in the airport. Left Vancouver 8 hrs late. Arrived in Honolulu at approx 10.00pm and got to hotel at midnight. We missed half a day in Honolulu. I will not fly to Hawaii again on Westjet.

### Jet Airways customer review
YVR-LAX-YVR. No problems with the ground crew and cabin crew all were polite and efficient. Flights on time (early arrival in fact) and boarding was orderly and quick. Didn't use the IFE but not all of them worked. 737-700 really is quite cramped and I'm not certain how a bigger person would realistically be comfortable (or even fit in the seat in the first place) but mercifully the flight's a short one at 2.5 hours. Juice pop water and coffee served once with a small cookie and such. It was turbulence virtually all the way down to LAX once we passed Seattle but that's not something quite within anyone's control I suppose. Overall good value for what is pretty much a short commuter flight.

### Jet Airways customer review
Economy Delhi (DEL) - Mumbai (BOM). Flight was on time and half full which was great. No entertainment on the flight at all but it was only 1 hour 40 minutes so no problem at all. Served a full hot meal and tea and coffee which was excellent for such a short flight. The food was tasty and a good portion size. An ice cream was offered after the meal which was much appreciated as the curry was rather hot. Staff were courteous at all times. The seat pitch is good and I was able to recline my seat and get some rest. The only negative was that the plane was rather old it just needs new seats and hopefully some TV screens. Overall a very good experience.

London - Mumbai - London. Business class is great good value for money. Seats comfortable good food and entertainment.

### Jet Airways customer review
LHR-DEL-BLR economy. Airport check in was smooth at all the airports the seats and IFE are very good. Unfortunately the food was ridiculous although dinner was ok breakfast which is supposed to be the main meal of the day had only a medium size muffin bowl of fruits and an orange juice. Flight attendants are rude and do not attend calls properly. I had asked for a drink she openly told me to fetch it from the galley. Jet has a lot to learn from other airlines about service and food quality.

London Heathrow to Delhi and Delhi to Kathmandu. I found the service to be excellent.

I would definitely fly them again.

Flew Vancouver to Dublin via Chicago. We were issued with 2 boarding passes each by Westjet. However we were told we would have to collect our luggage at Chicago O' Hare as our flight to Dublin was with AA. We did this and were late for our connecting flight because of it. We could not locate any Westjet employees to help us at Chicago.

### Jet Airways customer review
Westjet sorry is not as good as it used to be. Still enjoy the cabin service but not enjoying the "rules are rules" attitudes at the ticket counters. They are the same as any airline now looking for any chance to charge extra fees even when they could accommodate at no loss to themselves. Used to fly Westjet even if they were higher than other airlines but now because Westjet is just the same as any airline I'll just fly the lowest price.

### Jet Airways customer review
Flew HKG-BOM-HKG. Aircraft on the HKG-BOM leg was the Boeing 777 normally used for the London leg and not the Airbus which is the norm. Initial HKG-BOM leg was fair though the cabin could have been cleaner and more information could have been provided about a delay that was explained only after 35mins (a fire alarm) was malfunctioning in the cargo hold. The return BOM-HKG is the reason I will never fly Jet Airways again. Check in staff unaware that a Lufthansa Senator card is acceptable as Lufthansa is a partner airline. Be prepared for lacklustre service. The LHR-BOM leg is much better on Air India and the HKG-BOM leg is better served by Cathay Pacific.

### Jet Airways customer review
Milan to Mumbai via Delhi. Booked seats on 8th row. At Check in 24th row was allocated. No explanation or apology provided. On board the inflight entertainment system did not work. Got the system reloaded twice but still didn't work. A Cabin Crew member transferred us to the last row. After some time another Cabin Crew member told us to change seats as our current seats were reserved only for cabin crew members. Cabin Crew courteous until you ask them for a second drink. For breakfast were served a muffin! Do Not recommend Jet Airways.

### Jet Airways customer review
Jet Airways Privilege is supposed to be there to reward customers but our experience is that the airmiles upgrade system is a mess and full of silly out of date quotas. Recently my wife and I paid to transfer some air miles from our children's accounts. We both applied for upgrade from economy to business class. I was awarded an upgrade but my wife was put on a waiting list. After one week on the waiting list we took off with my wife still in economy class whilst I sat in business class. There were 9 seats occupied but 7 seats still empty in business class. When I have queried these empty seats they tell my they have a policy of restricting the number of upgrade seats available. Also to rub to make matters worse there was no way of checking whether upgrade seats were available before we had to pay for the JetPrivilege miles. What a shambles.

Flew Westjet from Toronto Canada to Santa Clara Cuba on 09/15/2012 returning 09/22/2012. We have flown Westjet before however it was an inauguration flight and had received amazing service. Little did we know that the inauguration service does not apply to all flights so we decided to go with Westjet Vacations. To be fair their aircraft have the most leg room compared with the other Canadian charter airlines. The entertainment consisting of Canadian TV channels was not working on both flights. I do understand that airlines want to save money on catering however all other charters except Air Canada and Westjet do offer hot meals on their flights. Westjet dares to give you the choice between a 100g snack pack or 2 miniature cookies (do not dare asking to have them both). The only check flight attendants seem to do is to make sure seat belts are on. Moving forward I will make sure when booking a package that the flight is with Air Transat Canjet or Sunwing.

### Jet Airways customer review
BOM-PNQ and PNQ-DEL. Jet Airways continues to be a reliable airline with comfortable seating also in Economy. Check-in was quick and efficient both legs and the crew friendly. One criticism I continue to have is seat allocation. On most airlines when two persons are booked together they are seated together. However on the first leg Jet Airways had filled all window and isle seats with individual passengers and my wife and I had to sit in different rows although we checked in two hours before flight. Happened to us before and I would very much prefer if Jet could make sure that groups booked together are not separated.

### Jet Airways customer review
BOM-BKK in B737 in Y. While Jet Airways continues to be consistent in terms of efficiency the overall flying experience with Jet has definitely nose-dived. Positives: Staff is helpful and responsive IFE is great good selection of English and Indian programs and movies. The flight was empty and on request I was moved to an emergency row seat with plenty of legroom and no neighbours. Negatives: No hot/cold towels F&B service was very average no snacks offered at the time of arrival alcoholic beverages not offered at all during the flight though I saw 1-2 passengers requesting for a beer and being served discreetly. Given the cost of the flight and a very average experience I will not prefer to fly Jet internationally in the future.

### Jet Airways customer review
I flew from Montreal to Toronto with Westjet on a KLM codeshare two days ago and when I arrived in Toronto although they announced it would only take 20 minutes for our baggage to be deposited on the carrousel for pick up it took over an hour thereby resulting in my missed connecting flight and had to stay the night in Toronto at a hotel. No one at the airport in Toronto could help me and one Westjet worker at the baggage area even told me I should have informed them that I had a tight connection and they would have sent them to Moncton (my final destination) with the next Westjet flight even though I was connecting with Air Canada. This was completely astonishing and untrue. When has it ever been ok for you to leave your bags and go on a flight with a different carrier and expect the other carrier to send your bags along. Anyway all Westjet reps I spoke with at Pearson told me to call the 1-800 number on the website which I did and I was told that 2 hours is not enough time for a connection with a domestic flight. Finally I called back again and spoke to someone who offered me a $200 travel credit with them. So in all I had a terrible experience with customer service with Westjet who tried to pass things off to others and no one would accept responsibility for their mistakes.

### Jet Airways customer review
I recently flew from Toronto to Moncton with my two small children. I unfortunately missed my flight by two minutes! It was my fault as we got lost in the airport and were not watching the time carefully. We were escorted to the service desk and the attendants were so nice to us. They saw how distraught I was because I thought I would have to pay for three additional flights but instead they gave us at no charge three free flights for the next day. I will definitely fly with Westjet on future flights.

4 return tickets for LHR-BOM-TRV four months before travel for a family holiday with children in Aug-Sept. Nearer to the travel date Jet Airways changed their flight schedule that extended the connection time in BOM to 23 hours. The alternative route through DEL with a stopover in Bangalore. We agreed to this reluctantly. 2 days before travel they made it worse by changing the re-routed schedule necessitating a change of plane in Bangalore. Web check-in was not possible. On outwards and return flights the seats allocated were scattered across the plane. When we landed at TRV they told us our baggage will arrive 24 hours later as they had lost them in Bangalore. They first agreed to deliver the bags to our hotel the next evening but they changed their mind a day later. The hotel manager had to send a car to the airport to collect the bags. Jet Airway's international operations used to be better than this. They cancel flights at short notice if the load factor does not meet their targets leaving passengers to suffer and knowingly leaving bags out during connections in order to depart quickly.

### Jet Airways customer review
DEL-SIN. The seats are very small (for Europeans) the staff were overwhelmed and not very friendly. The plane was old Boeing 737-300 and not clean as expected. The serviced food isn't worth a word. Partly cold no choice no tea no bun. Unfortunately the inflight entertainment was only in Indian and the quality of the headphones was even on max volume hard to understand. The worst part was the toilet with the feeling of being in a bad central station toilet.

Mumbai - JFK via Brussels on the 17th of July and back August 30th. I fail to understand why the Mumbai outgoing service is generally poor and you see the difference from Brussels to JFK. The crew out of Mumbai were surly even rude the food was inadequate and terrible for an 8 hour flight. I actually carried a sandwich for the Brussels to JFK sector but was pleasantly surprised at the change in everything. The crew was cheerful smiled a lot chatty and the food was good including the generous offerings from the wine and alcohol list. Flight from Mumbai was 30 minutes late taking off but after that on the dot and the return journey was as good. So why this discrepancy in service from Mumbai?

DEL-MXP Tuesday April 24th. Delay at Delhi: more than 90 minutes without any information or communication from the cockpit.

The cabin crew assistance has been awful: soon after the meal service all the cabin crew without any exception disappeared.

On Sunday my daughter and me returned to Pune from Coimbatore via Bangalore by JetKonnect. We had 30 mins to change flights at Bangalore. When disembarking at Bangalore there was an announcement for Pune passengers to assemble on the aerobridge. Two Jet Airways reps checked and double checked the passenger boarding cards confirmed the count and guided us through the connecting walkway to the aerobridge of the flight to Pune. How our baggage got loaded is still a mystery to me. The brown tag "Short Connect" on them seems to have done the trick. Arrived in Pune - 25 mins ahead of schedule! When we reached the baggage claim area luggage was rotating on the conveyor belt and it took us less than 5 mins to take our bags and walk out of the airport. On the onward journey from Pune also the flights were on-the-dot at Pune and Bangalore.

Toronto (YYZ) to New York (LGA) round trip. Flight was July 13th 2012. Friendly crew and flight attendants. Only entertainment is TV no internet. $10 for Headphones is ridiculous and they charge for blankets etc. Enough leg room for the smaller than average person. Seats don't recline far at all have to lean on the window side to take a nap; wake up with a sore neck but its only 1 hour. New York (LGA) to Toronto (YYZ) return - flight on July 20th 2012. Because of traffic I missed my flight. I called WestJet they said I could pay $200 to change my flight I said no. Rushed back home to get my luggage and off to LaGuardia. I see on the board a flight for 7.50pm and its 7.45pm. I explained to her what happened then she begins typing for 5mins+. I managed to get on the flight a seat in the back but no problem. No smell back was actually empty. Planes were clean and well maintained.

This is the only flight I've taken with Jet (London-Delhi return) and I was really pleasantly surprised. All the cabin crew were friendly and accommodating. The entertainment system is very comprehensive with lots of things to watch and read and the seats were really comfortable. I especially liked the little foot rest sack under the seat in-front. The food was alright definitely better than other airlines but not amazing. Overall I'd definitely recommend Jet.

Not a bad experience but not overwhelming. Flew DEL-HYD on JetConnect. In fairness it was billed as a no frills flight. Flight left on-time from DEL crew came by and sold snacks and sandwiches - very surprised at selling even water! Crew were okay and dealt with demanding passengers. The smile and warmth of this airline is however gone - not sure if it will come back.

I have flown Jet Airways on six separate return trips within the past twelve months back and forth between Toronto-Brussels-Delhi-Kathmandu in Business Class except for 4 of the 24 legs involved. Every flight left on schedule and most of them landed ahead of scheduled time. This airline operates like clockwork. It is very reliable. Baggage handling has also been very reliable - even through Delhi because it is in the hands of the one airline and they apparently make sure bags are transferred when they should be. In flight service has been excellent - friendly attentive comfortable seating in the lie-flats and a totally adequate set of menu choices for meals. More airlines should be this good.

### Jet Airways customer review
Had a very good experience from YYZ to BRU and back. Excellent service clean plane and good food. Flight attendants were very polite and professional. Better flights than some larger more expensive airlines I have used.

I flew Westjet from PVR Mexico to Comox Canada. The flight was on time comfortable and the service was wonderful. Their competitive fares on this international flight have me hooked as a new customer. The clincher was free first checked bag and the charge for our pet was half that of the competition.

### Jet Airways customer review
I flew from YEG to YVR and back. As usual the crew was friendly and hospitable and overall everything functioned efficiently. I agree that they do need to update their entertainment system and the seats aren't the most comfortable - which is why I choose not to fly with them on long-haul or international flights. I'll pay a few dollars extra for a little extra comfort. But if I'm looking for an inexpensive option for a short-hop then this is the airline for me. They've never lost my luggage I was offered a $50 credit just because my bags were a little late coming off the carousel was offered a full refund when another flight was cancelled and was offered a free meal and another refund when another flight was delayed due to mechanical issues.

### Jet Airways customer review
I'm surprised by such negative reviews on here. Maybe people have far too high expectations for a budget airline. I was really impressed by the quality and service on my flight (UK-BKK via Mumbai/Delhi). The hostesses were very polite and helpful. I had some difficult passengers behind me and they dealt with them with as much patience as they could. I enjoyed the food and felt that they came round often enough to offer drinks. Communication was good. The seats go back as far as you would expect for economy and the on- board entertainment was good. Toilets not particularly clean by the end of the flight but people should just learn to aim better. Overall excellent value for money.

### Jet Airways customer review
I used to travel from KWI-IDR-KWI every 6 months only because of the Jet Airways services and my perfect matching time schedule with it. My last journey with Jet Airways (May 2012) was the worst flight from Kuwait to Mumbai. The flight didn't contain seat back screens. Secondly and most disappointing was the night dinner which they served in very cheap quality meal box. I will recommend Jet Airways to my friends and family if they really provide the services they were providing previously.

### Jet Airways customer review
I like Westjet but unfortunately going to Vancouver and return to Toronto I could not get their online booking to work so consequently my husband and I could not sit together on each flight. Other then that Westjet is lovely to travel on.

### Jet Airways customer review
Tried to change to an earlier flight but that requires a $50 per person fee which makes no sense because the itinerary is identical and if there's space what difference does it make. There cost does not go up if we leave on the earlier flight. To make matters worse we were told that changing to the earlier flight would be free if our flight was showing as delayed. At the time it wasn't so he couldn't do anything. Even though we have a 4 month old baby that we now had to keep happy in the airport for 5 hours. To top it all off shortly following the earlier flights departure we learned that our flight would be delayed. My experiences with Westjet have always been nothing but positive but this inconvenience that could have been easily avoided has erased all the positive experiences. This was an unnecessary attempt by them to squeeze extra money out of me.

### Jet Airways customer review
Travelled from Kolkata to London Heathrow via Mumbai and appalled by the lack of customer service rude staff who constantly bumped into me on the aisle without apologising one of my 2 bags left in Mumbai. Overall just a very poor level of service.

### Jet Airways customer review
My partner and I recently flew to NYC. He on Air Canada where they make you pay for all checked baggage and I with Westjet. My checked bag was free. Westjet recently added a free cocktail to international flights. Toronto to New York is only 1 hour so I enjoyed my drink quickly. Excellent flight there but on the way back is what made the trip. I just missed my flight. The Staff at the gate took care of everything courteously and professionally. I expected to have to go back to the front desk and go through security again but he took care of everything while I was able to watch Euro cup in the lounge! This is highly impressive as it was a challenge for the staff as they are all new Westjet only started flying out of NYC three weeks earlier. 1 hour later I was on a plane watching the ground staff wave bye to the passengers on my plane!

### Jet Airways customer review
I have been travelling with Westjet for several years and I have been very impressed. The crew is friendly the inflight entertainment works 99% of the time (I have only have had one flight that the inflight entertainment was hit and miss and it was only on my TV set) and I have never had a single delay. I find the seating adequate and the baggage and carry-on allowance is exemplary. They certainly live up to being a friendly and caring airline! Flight: YYC to YKF return.

### Jet Airways customer review
DEL-SXR. Travelled LHR-DEL and then connected onto Srinagar. Had 46kgs weight allowed from London to Delhi but they did not allow the same on the domestic sector. They said policy had been revised 5 months back and baggage allowance on domestic sector was only 20kgs and not a kg extra. Had to pay overweight for rest of the weight. They have recently increased the overweight charges by 100% from Rs.100 per kg to Rs.200 per kg. The airline is totally disorganised and literally extort money. If they want to keep customers they should revisit their customer service strategy.

### Jet Airways customer review
BOM-DEL-MXP return. All flights on time. The first segment was on a 737-900 with slightly cramped seats. Meal quantity was okay. DEL-MXP on an A330 with good legroom and IFE latest movies and songs. Same on the return MXP- DEL. The last leg was on Konnect on an old 737-700 old seats and dirty window shades.

Westjet to Cancun from Montreal and back. I had a good flight to our vacation destination but on the return flight from Cancun to Montreal it was a bit of a bumpy ride and I was feeling very sick. I was very well taken care of by the flight attendants onboard. especially Lindsay. She knew just what to do to help me feel better and I am very grateful to her.

### Jet Airways customer review
On time clean and comfortable aircraft with a good amount of legroom courteous and helpful staff. Good in-flight entertainment. Could not fault Westjet.

### Jet Airways customer review
Heathrow-Mumbai-Hyderabad. Web check-in was easy. Onboard the seats were torn. Inflight entertainment pretty good but no great choice of Indian regional movies. No hot towels no welcome drink and food was served at midnight 2.5hrs after we boarded the flight. Cabin crew seemed very bored and frustrated with their job. The food was neither tasty nor sufficient for an adult. On the other side the domestic service was far better perfect evening snack cheerful cabin crew. I enjoyed the 1hr flight better the 9.5hr international flight. This would be my last international flight on Jet.

### Jet Airways customer review
YUL-YVR-YUL. The interiors of the 737-600 are beginning to show their age and the inflight entertainment system barely adequate. They should upgrade to an on-demand system. Service was ok. Obviously for a no- frills domestic flight one shouldn't expect too much. But it was embarrassing to witness a cabin crew who spoke no French on a flight out of Montreal. In terms of price service and convenience I would certainly choose AC next time over WJ. They truly aren't the great deal or friendly carrier they make themselves out to be.

### Jet Airways customer review
Heathrow to Delhi. Very easy check-in at Heathrow using terminal 4 is great because it's a small terminal so queues are far shorter for check-in and security than in other terminals. My flight was delayed an hour. Had good inflight service and the food and entertainment was adequate. My main problem with this airline compared to using other airlines is the fellow passengers. Be prepared to put up with people pushing their way forward at the boarding gate and for a relatively noisy flight. So although the airline is fine if you can get an equivalent flight on this route I'd take it.

### Jet Airways customer review
Bangkok to Heathrow and would not recommend them. The dirtiest toilets I've ever seen on any plane and staff couldn't care less about cleaning them. Appalling inedible food poor service and cabin crew that were not particularly polite. Leg room was quite good and the seats comfortable. The inflight entertainment was also good. Unfortunately the rest of the flight was so bad even comfortable seats and good entertainment couldn't make up for it.

### Jet Airways customer review
YWG-YYC-PVR return. Outbound flights on time return from YYC was slightly delayed comfortable seats although not as much recline as AC. Crew were all pleasant and cheerful. Food offerings could be improved they ran out of almost everything half way down the aisle. IFE was also poor few channels and PPV wasn't offered TV's cut out as soon as we were out of US airspace. Baggage arrived in a timely manner. Overall good flights just some improvements need to be made.

### Jet Airways customer review
Flew Muscat-Cochi return economy. Check-in at Muscat a little bit slow - more desks would help and controlled queues but no worse than any other airline there. Flight was on time. Seats in economy were comfortable and a good selection of video entertainment for the flight. Food also good. Staff were very friendly and helpful. On return flight we were warned to expect a long drawn out check-in and delays at passport control in Cochi. The only delay at check in was being given a complementary upgrade to business even though we had a non upgradable ticket. Passport security and visa checks were numerous but better than we had been told. Flight left early and the business cabin although small was better than expected for such a short haul flight. Business passengers got a dedicated bus to the terminal on arrival in Muscat. Overall a good experience in both cabins.

### Jet Airways customer review
YYZ-BRU-MAA return. Overall experience was fair. Brussels airport does not have same facilities as Amsterdam's Schipol. Flights departed on time. Food was passable but service was lacking on the BRU- Chennai sectors on both legs. IFE had a poor choice of movies so I stuck to the music channels. Since flights to/from India invariably have screaming babies I found my noise-cancelling headsets pretty useful! Jet Airways is slipping in quality both on domestic and international sectors.

### Jet Airways customer review
Flew from Toronto to Barbados. For the price I paid I expected a complimentary meal on a 6 hour flight. Onboard entertainment was pointless as it was only on for 20% of the flight and the flight attendants are in serious need of some hospitality training - some of the rudest ones I've encountered in my 20 years of travelling. Will definitely not be flying with Westjet again and wouldn't recommend it to anyone else either.

### Jet Airways customer review
I travelled May 29 from London Ontario to Winnipeg. Our original flight was delayed due to mechanical trouble found just before take-off and there was a several hour wait until another aeroplane could be brought in from Toronto. The Captain on the original flight spoke to us all politely calmly and explained the whole situation. We were deboarded given food vouchers and kept up to date with announcements on the plane's status. Every one of the West Jet staff treated passengers courteously and let them know of changes to their flights promptly. Their attitude was reflected in the calmness of us passengers.

### Jet Airways customer review
Khajuraho - Delhi. Flight left on time but total chaos at Khajuraho Airport far too many people stuffed into a too small waiting area. Plane was clean and staff could not have been more helpful. No inflight service as such as the flight duration was relatively short.

### Jet Airways customer review
Chandigarh to Bangalore. Was disappointed. Flight delayed more than an hour and they didn't even apologize for the delay. They gave us the seat in the last row (where we couldn't recline the seat) in spite of empty seats in front. Inflight service was poor and getting a glass of water was difficult.

### Jet Airways customer review
Overall my experience from JFK to Chennai and connecting to Hyderabad is poor. Staff service is poor seat comfort average. Very poor inflight entertainment often with interruptions. Check-in in Chennai is very poor no systematic way of checking and very unprofessional staff.

### Jet Airways customer review
London to Delhi I was really disappointed with the way Jet Airways Premiere product has been run down. While ground handling and the Skyteam lounge is just about acceptable the onboard so called "Premiere" and inflight service is deplorable. The crew do not seem interested in putting in that extra effort to make the flight experience memorable. Onboard the product is scant. The beverage list is thin the food quality and quantity is limited. Maintenance of the interiors is a joke. I would rather now take a one stop flight to and from Europe than fly non stop on an Indian carrier.

### Jet Airways customer review
RIO-IGU. Old planes with worn seats flight was on time quite expensive food onboard the ticket as for South America was quite cheap but comparing to European prices was quite expensive for that standard.

### Jet Airways customer review
YYZ-BRU return. Both ways the flight left on time and arrived early. The meal provided both ways was excellent however the service was a little impersonal and cold. When we arrived back in Toronto the plane had just left the active runway and most people were up trying to get their carry on bags while the flight attendants were still in there seats. It took a good 2 or 3 minutes before anyone asked for passengers to please sit down. No one listened anyway.

### Jet Airways customer review
EWR-BOM-EWR in economy class. I had checked in online for BOM-EWR however on arrival had to queue for 15 mins. Although class-wise and seat-wise boarding is 'supposedly' followed they just forget the last cluster of seats. You have to be smart enough to stand along with the previously announced seats in order to avail some cabin luggage space. Cabin crew disinterested requested help in stowing my bag to a male crew member and he simply ignored my request. Food service was very slow and late. Even beverages were a rarity and had to repeatedly ask the crew for it. The last snack on both the forward and return journey was a total disappointment! From EWR-BOM I was smart enough to carry some snacks onboard anticipating the conditions. Inflight entertainment is the only saving grace with a decent collection of music/movies. But no way does it justify the ticket prices that are competitive with other International Carriers.

### Jet Airways customer review
Flew to Saskatoon via Calgary from Toronto and home again. Every single plane was freezing cold. Are they just trying to make you buy a blanket?

### Jet Airways customer review
BLR-MAA-SIN and SIN-BOM-BLR in Economy. I am a FF and have always liked their service. I have flown long routes BOM-PVG-SFO where service seems to be slipping. Initial flight BLR-MAA delayed which caused a domino effect on everything else. I had very little time to connect in Chennai and was running from gate to gate with my luggage. I had to clear immigration security and guess what they use the same boarding gate and bus for 2 flights to Singapore and Colombo. This caused a lot of confusion even though I finally managed to get on the Boeing 737 to Singapore. Seats were quite narrow but legroom was plenty because I chose exit rows. I didn't care much about IFE. One FA told me they ran out of blankets and the other one promptly got it to me 5 minutes later. The meal was decent but the dessert was very nice. We arrived at an excellent time in Singapore (8am). Return flight was just the opposite. Inflight experience was excellent on Airbus 330 from Singapore to Bombay. Seats and legroom was excellent. They served decent meals and again the dessert was above average. Headphones were not working I asked for a replacement and they gave me a second one which was worse. Arrived in Bombay at 10pm connecting flight was at 3am. BOM airport is a nightmare to say the least. Overall decent experience. Jet needs to improve upon their customer service to become a truly international airline.

### Jet Airways customer review
Ground crew at both ends were pleasant and accommodating. We used Web Check-in going and coming. This was fast and easy and we did not have to stand in any lines. Seats are comfortable the food good although a little spicy. There was real cutlery - not plastic! The flight crew was friendly and attentive. There was a wide selection of movies and TV programs to choose from. The plane was very clean when we boarded - each seat had a pillow and blanket. This was one of the most pleasant experiences I have had in flying for several years. It was also the only direct flight from Toronto to Brussels - and the least expensive.

### Jet Airways customer review
JNB-BOM-HKG-BOM-JNB. Onboard experience in business class is acceptable but could definitely improve. The seats are very good lie flat models laid out in a style similar to that of Virgin Atlantic. Not as comfortable though - a touch too short for a good sleep. Food was tasty enough but not enough choice. Very comfy sleeper suits on overnight flights. Lack of eye shades is annoying. All in all the onboard experience is acceptable. However it's on the ground where the product fails miserably. Lounge in JNB was good. The entire airport experience in Mumbai from security to the horrific business class lounge is without a doubt the worst airport experience I've had anywhere. In HKG they share a lounge with Air France. 3 Day old newspapers. Enough said. The price on the route was competitive and that's what made me give it a try. Next time I'm paying the extra bit to travel on any of the three big Gulf carriers.

### Jet Airways customer review
LHR-MUM-GOA return Premiere class first leg was overnight and was superb staff polite and attentive offered me a choice from the first class menu when they sensed that nothing appealed from the Premiere menu provided drinks on request beds very comfortable nice wash bags etc. Mumbai-Goa leg was fine both ways charming service and a full meal served even though it was a short hop. MUM-LHR leg back was a daytime flight and I noticed a marked difference in the level of service staff while attentive when summoned were for the most part inattentive no wash bags provided nor were sleep suits offered as they were on the way out. Overall however I would generally recommend Jet Airways to travel to India.

### Jet Airways customer review
We were very impressed with WestJet staff when flying from Toronto to St. John's with our dog. They have a new system where they rip off the ticket once the dog is loaded and then a member of the crew hands you the ticket and you know that your dog is on board. It's a great system and I wish all airlines would do this. Staff very friendly courteous and helpful. I missed the food cart the first time the flight attendant was very nice and went out of her way to get me something even though we were close to landing. Their fees are very competitive and much cheaper when it comes to flying pets. They also don't charge extra for one way flights which is a nice perk. My only complaint was that the seats were big enough but they were leather and they did have TV programs available for free (movies cost money).

### Jet Airways customer review
Mumbai-London. I had the misfortune of sitting directly behind a couple who's two babies screamed incessantly for the vast majority of the flight. The cabin crew showed about as much interest in shutting them up as the parents did. As a result a long flight made seemingly longer due to the constant racket and lack of sleep. I flew business on the way out and the attitude of the cabin crew was pretty lax. Once they'd handed the food out they were not to be seen again until breakfast was served. The return leg in which I flew economy wasn't much better in terms of the attitude of the cabin crew. The only way I've been able to guarantee a non-veg meal is to request it when booking-in online. All in all not too happy with them.

### Jet Airways customer review
I was a loyal business class passenger and recommended them to others. Sadly they have lost their charm of late after my experience having flown LHR-BOM and also LHR-HKG via BOM both journeys in Business class. Seats probably the best in the airline industry but very noticeably the food and beverages have deteriorated considerably. The main meal is limited in choice and presentation has faltered even drinks have been downgraded and the frequency of the offer has been drastically reduced. The transfer experience at Mumbai has to be the worst in the world and although not Jets fault reflects badly on them. An hour and 20 mins to security check between International flights is well beyond acceptable.

### Jet Airways customer review
Value for money - depends on destination and competition! YVR to PSP. Westjet offers the only direct service (seasonal) between Vancouver and Palm Springs which is great; unfortunately some return fares are greater than a flight to the UK! Flights into LAX (a similar distance) are much less costly likely due to competition! Consequently we fly into LAX and pick up a rental car for a 2 hour drive to PS. Hopefully Virgin (or other carriers) will start direct YVR-PSP flights in the not too distant future.

### Jet Airways customer review
LAX to YVR. I travel this route regularly and have witnessed Westjet's standards and service decline. This flight was 2 hours late leaving LAX. No warning provided by ground staff at LAX. No apology or explanation by pilot once onboard. IFC bored. Aircraft dirty Westjet still continue to refer to passengers as 'guests' yet increasingly do not treat them as such. Air Canada product now is consistently superior.

### Jet Airways customer review
Having a flight completely cancelled one weekend due to mechanical problems with the plane and then the following weekend having the flight delayed because of mechanical problems that necessitated switching out not only the original plane scheduled but also the replacement aircraft after one leg of the journey severely reduced my confidence in the Westjet fleet. Service agents have also suffered a noticeable decline in the quality of service and attitude with which they deal with the passengers. All told - there are other airlines out there and I will be using them where possible.

### Jet Airways customer review
On a return flight from Honolulu to Calgary and paying for an exit row seat I was less then impressed to board the plane and see a 350lb plus gentleman in his seat and half of mine in the exit row. He couldn't walk and had to be assisted onto the plane in a wheelchair and off the same way. I always thought there was some sort of regulations regarding exit rows. I feel that I paid for my seat I should get it and someone that large should buy 2 seats and not be allowed in an exit row! We fly to Hawaii every year and I won't fly them again.

### Jet Airways customer review
YYZ-BRU-YYZ. Both aircraft's were fairly new A330-200. Cabin cleanliness acceptable. Movie selection very good. Best Y class seat comfort I have experienced across the pond. Negative sides: water seems a rarity on these flights. When meals are served all there is to drink is a small sealed cup of water sitting in the coffee cup. Second issue: between meals crews are non-existent.

### Jet Airways customer review
SIN-DEL Check-in and boarding were quick and flawless. 30 minute delay due to some maintenance checks although captain kept us updated. Onboard A330-200 was in a good condition with a modern cabin complete with large PTV screens new recliner style seats in economy large bins and mood lighting. Seats were at the wider end of the spectrum and legroom quite generous. AVOD entertainment system with large PTV screens was quite good with a wide choice movies. Dinner had 3 choices alcoholic beverages and soft drinks however were limited in choice. Most significant was the cabin crew. Although not rude they seemed committed to doing the bare minimum. Hardly visible during boarding and one quick meal service after that they were invisible for 6 hours. During service they were expressionless and did not seem very comfortable communicating with customers even though they had a reasonable command of English. Overall a very competitive hardware but lets itself down on the soft product.

### Jet Airways customer review
BOM-SIN in Y Class. Overall a positive experience flight was on a pretty new A330-200. No wait to check-in at the airport and no delays. Legroom was good and staff friendly and efficient. One meal on a 5 hr flight enough. Overall Jet are probably the best Indian airline at the moment.

### Jet Airways customer review
Very bad experience! Flying London to Bangalore via Mumbai return via Delhi. Travelling with 10 month old no consideration from crew. Worst customer service delayed connecting flights long waiting times (45 min after arrival stuck onboard before being allowed to leave - 30 mins before stroller was handed back and another 45 mins before luggage arrived). Staff attitude was unfriendly unhelpful and inefficient.

### Jet Airways customer review
In a nutshell I can not fault Jet Airways all 4 of our flights left and arrived on time. All luggage was successfully transferred and collected there was enough choice of entertainment seats were comfortable staff very helpful and polite and the food tasted good. I checked in online so didn't even have to queue at the airport. Negatives - coffee onboard was not great.

### Jet Airways customer review
Flew Premiere Class BKK-BOM-MAA-DEL-BKK. Inflight experience on all 4 legs was superb with on-time takeoff and departures great food served on china attentive flight attendants decent selection of movies clean cabin. The only glitch was a very short connection in Delhi which necessitated the intervention of a Jet Airways agent to try to speed me through customs and security. I appreciated his effort but why didn't he just get someone to take us to the gate? Would definitely fly them again.

### Jet Airways customer review
We travelled from London Heathrow to Mumbai and it was very good for economy class. Food was nice entertainment very good as it had the latest films/music and the cabin crew were very polite. We got a connecting domestic Jet Airways flight from Mumbai to Goa.

Flight from Vancouver to Calgary delayed a few times within a few hours due to mechanical problems. I was stranded in Vancouver for more than 6 hours before WestJet arranged an alternative plane to fly to Calgary. My original 4 pm departure from Vancouver turned out to be 10.33 pm arriving in Calgary a few minutes to 1 am. Very disappointed even though they gave us $10 food voucher.

LHR-DEL-LHR in business class. Flights on time excellent seats for sleeping. Cabin feels very spacious and was clean. Catering also good with pleasant crews. Excellent product and certainly the best on this route.

### Jet Airways customer review
Not sure why people complain about the food on Jet we recently flew with them from LHR to BOM and onto GOI return and were more than pleased. The food was plentiful hot and tasty. We are impressed how they manage to serve a meal to everyone on the 45 minute internal flight. The seats were comfortable the plane was clean and on time on all legs good luggage allowance pleasant flight attendants reasonable choice of IFE.

### Jet Airways customer review
Delhi-London. Inflight service was appalling. Cabin crew was extremely rude and unprofessional. The food was of very poor quality. I had one beer before meal when I asked for another drink I was told that since I have already had one drink I have to wait at least 2 hours before I could have another.

### Jet Airways customer review
I am 70 yrs old with poor balance due to a spinal cord injury. I pre-booked wheelchair assistance leaving YVR and arriving in Ottawa and for the return trip. At YVR the check-in attendant took my bag to the luggage depot for me asked if I wanted to walk through security and to get a ride on the other side. On the return my son brought my bag into the check-in and he was asked to accompany me to the gate. I walked to the escalator and through security the guard seeing my cane and ability in walking allowed me to go through the line. Once I got to the gate a staff member had apparently been looking for me at check-in to help. He helped me in walking and carrying my purse onto the plane and ensured there would be a wheelchair at the plane in Vancouver. How does the lack of communication happen?

### Jet Airways customer review
BOM-LHR-BOM. Food was too little and tasteless for the most part. Was served a cupcake and 100 ml of Orange juice for a breakfast meal. Only one drink served voluntarily by the crew ask for a second and they will hesitantly oblige. The only good thing about the flights was the seat which is better than BA or AI that fly this route. IFE needs to be updated and maintained only left side headphone worked for both flights.

### Jet Airways customer review
LHR-BOM-LHR. Have to say that this airline has completely lost its charm. Only one drinks service through the entire 9/9.5 hour flight. Meals were completely tasteless. The only positive was the generous luggage allowance which is 46kg. Definitely sticking to the Middle Eastern airlines for trips to India in the future such as Emirates.

### Jet Airways customer review
Toronto to Brussels Brussels to Delhi and back to Brussels. The food quality which was excellent before had declined considerably. The coffee is brewed badly and the stewardess service has dropped significantly. Just arrived from Delhi and me and several other passengers using the wheelchair had to wait for an hour for the Jet Airways staff to retrieve our luggage and no one would help us. I used to be a loyal customer but will not choose Jet Airways again.

### Jet Airways customer review
PHX-YVR-YWG. Westjet counter at PHX was busier than usual but didn't take more than 15 minutes to check- in. Got to the gate with 1 hour to spare it was packed and despite lots of seats seating was far and few between. Boarded on time but delayed 30 minutes. Once airborne as per the usual the live TV malfunctioned and only 3-4 stations worked. Inflight crew seemed friendly enough on both flights. I still prefer Westjet but they are getting worse and more expensive each year.

### Jet Airways customer review
On January 19 2012 cabin crew informed us as we boarded the plane at Princess Juliana Airport in Saint Maarten that they did not have enough fuel to return to Toronto and would land in Puerto Rico to refuel. This added over 2 hours to the 4 hour return trip. Naturally we missed our Toronto connection. There was no advance indication on the WestJet website at the check-in counter or in the airport about the extra stop.

### Jet Airways customer review
Brussels to New Delhi on A330-200. Cabin crew extremely helpful and funny. Very professional and kind. Food and entertainment was good. Flight delayed two hours due to a problem with one of the passengers the crew kept us informed. Seat was comfortable for the 9.5 hr flight. Extremely good flight and will fly them again.

### Jet Airways customer review
Roundtrip Toronto-Chennai via Brussels economy class. All legs were comfortable attentive crew. Food was ok. Inflight entertainment menu was passable. BRU-YYZ sector has cleaner planes and more professional FAs. On all legs many passengers managed to get oversized luggage into the cabin. Some even had more than the allowed number of items. Jet airways should do something about this since it is so unfair to the rest of the passengers.

### Jet Airways customer review
I used Jet previously and found the service at check-in and inflight excellent. I was a little disappointed by the attitude of flight staff on my last trip. Unlike the smiling helpful service I was accustomed to it was a little off hand I didn't see a single smile on the Mumbai to Bangkok leg of the flight. The food left much to be desired. Seats are good and the planes very good. Staff need a little more training in interpersonal relationships.

### Jet Airways customer review
DEL-LKO-DEL. Flew Jet lite who operate this route on behalf of Jet Airways. Flights were on time both ways crew friendly and enthusiastic. A nice touch was the complimentary scratch cards given out although on closer examination it cost 699 rupees to redeem the prize. Baggage delivery in Lucknow took time and in Delhi there was some confusion over which baggage belt the bags were arriving at.

### Jet Airways customer review
LHR-DELHI-LHR. Package holiday but upgraded to business class. They seem to have gone for comfort over everything else. My friends seat did not work and was met with very frosty reception when she complained. No English papers available. Only water or fruit juice offered before take-off. No seatbelt checks before take off. Very poor choice of food and certainly not served with finesse or a smile. No small bottles of water available. On overnight flight very poor "goody bag" - no eye mask. No tea or coffee was offered after lunch or dinner. Toilets running out of toilet paper. Overall there seemed to be very little care for the passengers in business.

### Jet Airways customer review
Flight from Palm Springs to Vancouver in what is apparently a new plane without any entertainment units installed and no food for sale? What on earth has happened to Westjet. I used to like flying with them now they are more like Skyservice (which is definitely not a compliment).

### Jet Airways customer review
As a frequent flier between Bombay-Brussels (I held a platinum card till recently) I have noticed that service is slipping a bit of late. When they checked your boarding pass on boarding they always had a smile and were cheerful. Both courtesies are largely absent these days. These may be a small gestures but they indicate that things have slipped.

### Jet Airways customer review
Cabin crew amateurish and acted like they were doing me a favour. Our flight was 9 hours I feel regular snacks during the 9 hours would have been good. The meal was awful the snack they finally offered was too peppery. I had to ask for a drink. The entertainment was poor. Luggage allowance was excellent for my shopping spree.

Flew from Heathrow to Delhi business class seats were excellent in the herringbone formation. Very comfortable and private but the leg from Delhi to Bangkok was awful business class is premium economy at best.

### Jet Airways customer review
Recently flown Vizag-Chennai-Dubai. Brand new aircraft with no inflight entertainment. Staff are neither friendly nor rude. I am a Silver member on this airline and travel frequently and must say their service level is falling slowly. They made changes to their meal - now of a suitable quantity. Overall the flight experience was good.

### Jet Airways customer review
ATQ-DEL-LHR. Having travelled with jet a number of times now over the years you can really notice that standards have dropped in terms of quality of food and service. Service of meals and drinks is now rushed. Would seriously consider using alternative carrier in future.

### Jet Airways customer review
London to Las Vegas. Crew could not have been nicer seats a little worn but seemed to have a bit more room than Delta and Canjet.

### Jet Airways customer review
DOH-BOM-DOH Business Class. Standards have fallen! Cabin looked worn and tired. Old fashioned domestic type business class seats on the B738. Food so-so. Cabin crew attentive but amateurish. Wines served in business class were cheap French 4€ table wines. Champagne AWOL. IFE was terrible. Worst part was the time it took for luggage to arrive both in BOM and DOH. Bags were tagged priority but arrived next to last.

### Jet Airways customer review
New York JFK-Chennai-Coimbatore round-trip transit via BRU. Flight attendants were helpful and patient. As for food the quality was so-so quantity inadequate vegetables sorely missing. Real silverware was provided. Every time the air-conditioning comes on it sprays a very strong musky fragrance which triggered coughs and sneezes among quite a few passengers. I have flown quite a few other carriers and none spray fragrance into the cabin so frequently.

BLR-CJB on an ATR 72. Departed 5 mins ahead of schedule and arrived 15 minutes early. Very friendly crew though the pre-ordered meals could be much better. Would recommend and will use again.

### Jet Airways customer review
Chennai-Goa (with stop in Bangalore). Nice B738 leather seats with personal TV that offers no show. 1st segment is a 30 mins hop from Chennai to Bangalore. 2nd segment a 55 mins hop from Bangalore to Goa. Two short hops and Jet Airways was trying to peddle Food-For-Purchase when they could have sensibly given away complimentary sodas and peanuts like most US carriers. I feel pity for the FAs who have to deal with collecting payments and ensuring the change are returned to the appropriate passengers in time for landing.

### Jet Airways customer review
As a person who has been flying frequently on this airline (I held a platinum card till recently) I have noticed that service is slipping a bit of late. When they checked your boarding pass on boarding they always had a smile and were cheerful. Both courtesies are largely absent these days. These may be a small gestures but they indicate that things have slipped.

### Jet Airways customer review
We were returning from Cancun. On take off the plane had to abort take off the captain advised we were going back to the terminal. 3 hours later the plane was able to leave. Our initial departure time was 6.20 pm now it was 9.30 pm. When finally in the air we were told that there was no food available for purchase. Overall a miserable experience.

### Jet Airways customer review
A very smooth flight on board their new ATR 72 aircraft. Service was good on the short 45 minute hop from Bangalore to Coimbatore. The legroom was decent compared to ATR's operate by other carriers. Food service was good not great. Would recommend and use again.

### Jet Airways customer review
Excellent flight from LHR to BKK via BOM. LHR to BOM was great - seat 26 with extra legroom! IFE could have been better though the food quality was good although mostly Indian food. BOM to BKK return was on 737-800. Plane was a bit tired and although offered IFE the range was limited. The legroom was also smaller than on the 777-300er. Transit in BOM is not highly recommended although that is not really the airlines fault and the inflight service makes up for it.

### Jet Airways customer review
Heathrow to Mumbai return in Business Class. Good trip both ways. Staff extremely attentive. Nice food and excellent wine. Comfortable flat bed seats although slightly short for me.

### Jet Airways customer review
London to Bangkok and changed flights in Mumbai. First leg was with an 777 and was really comfortable. Second a 737. Service and food was good. Overall I enjoyed the flights and would use them again when needed.

### Jet Airways customer review
Staff are great but the seats incredibly uncomfortable and 50% of the time there are problems with the inflight entertainment when it does work they charge for movies that others offer for free. A 4 hour flight with no entertainment packed into a plane like a sardine with overhead compartments stuffed to bursting and baggage under your feet is just not a pleasant way to travel. Pleasant and professional staff help make up for some of the discomfort. Bottom line: Low prices uncomfortable flights inflight entertainment hit and miss.

### Jet Airways customer review
London-Delhi Delhi-Goa and Goa-London stopover in Mumbai. Flights were fine staff were nice food not too bad and inflight entertainment good. The only slight annoyance was the 2 hours it took in getting from the domestic to international terminals at Mumbai airport. Our flight were delayed by 3 hours no announcements advising of this. Overall happy with Jet and would use them again.

### Jet Airways customer review
SDU-GRU-SDU. B737-300's they are a bit old and the seat comfort is average but they are well maintained B737-800's are new and very comfortable. If you want low price average comfort and a punctual flight fly with them.

### Jet Airways customer review
LHR-BOM-LHR on A330. I went out in Business return in First. Superb service both ways. Business Class cabin is well appointed with an excellent seating layout and plenty of room. One criticism would be the lack of storage space in the seat. The food was wonderful. Return I was in First and the trip could not have been better. Comfortable seat 23" screen and a huge range of entertainment. A flat wide bed in a private cabin was fantastic.

### Jet Airways customer review
YVR-PHX-YVR. Both flights left punctually flight and ground crews friendly and professional. Inflight service more than adequate with a purchase-meal and beverage run after take-off another drink and snack run after that and then a final water run an hour before landing. Crews were cheerful on both flights and had time for passengers.

### Jet Airways customer review
Westjet has become a no frills airlines. An almost 6 hour flight Vancouver to Lihue return on a new plane they have not installed entertainment units. Unfortunately the seat pocket provided more past passenger refuse than reading material. Not a pillow or blanket to use or rent on an overnight flight. Not everyone can sleep on a plane so the TV is a valuable distraction. Staff members were friendly enough and there were announcements on which carousel our baggage could be claimed.

### Jet Airways customer review
BLR-CJB. A short 40 minute flight on the new ATR 72 aircraft. Crew could be a little friendlier. Flight was smooth and on time.

### Jet Airways customer review
BRU-EWR / JFK-BRU. A330 pretty clean and well kept (apart from toilets). Ground services were fine both in BRU and NYC food was nice and entertainment ok for a 7 hrs flight. Cabin crew without personality and superficial. They weren't rude but they were not friendly. Whenever I called them they took ages to show up and were always forgetting what I asked 30 seconds before. Cabin crew definitely below average but the rest is ok.

### Jet Airways customer review
Have flown Westjet for the first time between YYZ and YYC. I'm highly disappointed! Those seats are not comfortable. The inflight entertainment system is ridiculous. The so called ''live TV'' when the crew makes an announcement doesn't even stop. With other airlines at least it stops so you can continue watching where you were. Plus I find the crew and the employee in general so unprofessional. This over friendly attitude just look too fake to me!

### Jet Airways customer review
I've flown Westjet numerous times in the past few months and despite loving their inflight service and the comfort of their seats I have to say it's time to upgrade or do away with inflight entertainment service. I have not been on a plane lately where a TV screen near me was malfunctioning. If the person in the middle seat touches the box with their foot you can see all three screens flicker. Perhaps they should get rid of in- seat entertainment entirely and replace it with wifi and maybe a return to meal service. Everyone now has an iPod or DVD player anyway it's sort of redundant.

### Jet Airways customer review
YYZ-YYC. TV worked properly for a change managed to get most of the channels. Crew seemed disinterested in doing their work which is a little unusual for Westjet. I do have to say though I can't stand their seats. I am only 5'9" but the seat ends about half way down my thigh. There is no support and after 4+ hours a little tiring. Don't think I would fly them long distances.

### Jet Airways customer review
Toronto-Brussels-Chennai. Seats were much better on Brussles-Chennai sector with small "cubicles" more supportive seat cushions. Seats reclined to horizontal easily. Food was fine though a little spicy (even for an Indian taste) at times. Plenty of wine and liquor to go around. Excellent attentive staff. Check-in at Brussles was chaotic with no clear lines for Business class.

### Jet Airways customer review
Toronto to Brussels. Spacious legroom. Food was good and enough. Staff friendly and professional. Excellent entertainment. New clean aircraft. On time. Very good value for the money.

### Jet Airways customer review
I flew Jet Konnect on Chennai-Kolkata Pune-Hyderabad and Hyderabad-Chennai legs. Jet Konnect doesn't provide any refreshments during these flights with passengers having the option to buy them onboard. The disappointing thing is about the attitude of the staff who didn't seem to notice people not having seat belts fastened on landing.

### Jet Airways customer review
Delhi to Singapore. Good seat pitch and entertainment system. However the food was horrible - it was an early afternoon flight and breakfast was provided?

### Jet Airways customer review
Flew Business Class DOH-BOM-DOH. Outbound: Used the Oryx lounge at Doha airport which was nice. Cabin was nearly empty. Seats are similar to those on Jet's domestic business class. Found it difficult to sleep with the recline provided. At 6'3" legrests did not help as my legs overshot it. The light sandwich was passable. Service was attentive and cheerful. Inbound: Evening flight so looked forward to meal and wine. Same cheap French table wine. Indian non-veg meal was not great. Cabin crew were attentive and friendly. IFE was limited. One negative was that my bag was one of the last off both flights with a priority tag.

### Jet Airways customer review
My family and I travelled Doha to Cochin return Business class both ways. Outbound flight to Cochin a youngster from economy was permitted to stow his baggage over my wife's seat came into business class opened the locker dropping a bag on my wife sitting below. This happened in the presence of inflight staff who did not intervene and stop this passenger. On our return journey we boarded before economy passengers had occupied their seats we had many passengers 'brushing' past us in the aisle with bulky hand baggage. The finale to this memorable saga on the return flight we were presented with the standard Menu card. We were seated in the second row from the front of business class and yet we were told that the fish on the menu had already run out. I will not be travelling Jet in the future.

### Jet Airways customer review
HKG to London via Mumbai. Landed Mumbai but Boeing 777 to London delayed. Initially told delay 30 mins then it was going to be 7 hours late. We were offered food urn of sweetened tea and some kind of veggie burger. On our flight suddenly every reading light came on and the crew couldn't turn them off. The entertainment system didn't work for my seat for most of the flight. Reassuringly everything started working 4 hours into our flight. Not a pleasant experience cabin crew helpful and pleasant.

### Jet Airways customer review
BOM-BLR return. I booked with Jet Airways in order to gain some miles with United. Boarding at BOM began 45 minutes before the flight and everyone was seated (at 100% load) 15 minutes later. We sat at the gate another 30 minutes hooked to the jet bridge. The aircraft held 8 in F and 162 in the back on a 737-800 and I have never seen such tight seat pitch. Boarding is done in a single group thus people are scattered up and down the aisle trying to stow carry on baggage. It's a zoo with folks lining back up the jet bridge. Cabin crew was still trying to secure the cabin for landing 30 seconds before landing. Plenty of cabin advertising. As it is it appears to be the Indian version of a low cost Irish carrier.

### Jet Airways customer review
Overall a pleasant experience despite the fact we didn't get the seats we booked on any leg of our journey this caused some stress as we are a group of 6 people travelling with children. The seats on the LHR-DEL flight were comfortable and IFE was excellent. The food was ok would have been nice if they catered for the kids. Staff were pleasant and helpful. We had a 2 hour delay due to fog before we could depart for Bangkok. Our return journey was without any delays we stopped in Mumbai on return and security was effortless - was expecting chaos from reading other reviews.

### Jet Airways customer review
Goa-Mumbai-Vadodara Domestic Flight. The food on both flights was below average and service in general poor. Flight was on time and baggage wait acceptable. Needs a lot of improvement to become an international carrier. It does not make sense to pay a full fare against the low cost domestic carriers.

### Jet Airways customer review
LHR-BOM. Online check-in was without any problems and I was able to get a window seat. Check-in at the airport was good with minimum waiting time. Boarding was disciplined and swift the veg option delicious a good choice of films the seat was comfortable (more so than Kingfisher's) and service was prompt and unobtrusive. Baggage took longer than I expected from previous experience of Jet.

### Jet Airways customer review
My wife and I flew Vancouver to Halifax. Our connection in Calgary to Halifax left before our flight from Vancouver got in. Information was passed to us and Westjet personnel were helpful professional and friendly. We were given vouchers for meals transportation and rooms for the night. Our final flight from Toronto to Halifax was on a new plane inflight personnel were friendly with a kind word and smile.

### Jet Airways customer review
YVR to LAS once or twice every year since 2007 I use the self check-in online 24hr prior to my flight and have never had a problem with it. When I get to YVR or LAS all I have to do is check my bag staff are always polite and helpful. Cabin crew have always been very nice and helpful on all my flights.

### Jet Airways customer review
Orlando from Ottawa (Direct) but when checking in online found out there was a Layover in Toronto. We were never informed about flight changes. As well as that the flight left 45 minutes earlier than planned. The flight home was also later than booked. Is it not Westjet policy to inform us of any time changes? We were told that these changes were made early in the fall. Why were we not informed? Otherwise the flight itself was good.

### Jet Airways customer review
YLW to YKF. Great new connection. Used to have to leave Kelowna at 7am sit in Calgary for almost 4 hours before departing to Kitchener. There is now a 10.10 with a 30 minute connection in Calgary for a total elapsed time of 5 hours. Very pleasant male attendant serving the middle of the plane no stupid jokes or songs- just good service.

### Jet Airways customer review
I book about 10 flights a year and the service has continuously gone downhill. A few weeks ago my husband and I booked a flight to Edmonton and I was charged an additional $15 on my credit card - they said I checked to book seats which I never do and my husband and I didn't even get to sit together. Their new policy of one bag only is a crock - everyone is now carrying their baggage on board (me included) because you only have 1 free checked bag which means it takes forever to get to your seat while everyone is loading their own luggage and forever to get off. The last 2 flights I took with Westjet this month were both delayed while they waited for late passengers. I'm looking for a new airline!

### Jet Airways customer review
YVR-PSP-YVR. Both flights on time staff friendly and the planes are clean. I like this non-stop seasonal compared with connecting through SFO or LAX with UA. The only drawback was the small TV screens.

### Jet Airways customer review
Vancouver to Calgary - 2 hour layover - then Calgary to Regina. Plane boarded on time and efficiently in Vancouver. Staff were friendly as usual. Seat was comfortable and we had the exit row. We got a small snack and soft drink on each flight. Inflight TV was good though it is getting dated compared to newer systems. Flight from Calgary to Regina was delayed 2 hours due to weather issues. De-ice added 20 minutes to the delay. Once airborne the flight was good.

### Jet Airways customer review
San Diego to Toronto with a connection in Calgary. There was only about 45 people on the first flight to Calgary and the flight attendants were friendly and hospitable making jokes with passengers. Calgary to Toronto was a little busier however the staff were still excellent.

### Jet Airways customer review
Vancouver to Honolulu. The head stewardess was unprofessional she spoke so fast that she was tripping over her words and we could not understand anything she was saying. Food was cold and over priced there was no light beer for sale and no free water. I had to have my cabin bag under my seat the whole flight because all the overhead lockers were full as people were allowed to take too much cabin luggage onboard. The toilets were dirty and there were not enough for the amount of passengers. The movies that we had to pay for were old and out of date. Cabin lights were not dimmed so there was no way of getting some sleep.

### Jet Airways customer review
My husband and myself along with our 2 children have flown at least 3 times a year for the past 4 years. Yes the flights can be a bit late however we all like the food offered the satellite TV and the friendly and helpful crew.

Newark to Calgary return. Efficient check-in flying with 2 children and one infant can be a pain however staff made it easy to get settled and comfortable in the cabin. They helped keep the kids entertained on the 4.5hr flight. Good value and flight was right on time.

### Jet Airways customer review
Flew Vancouver-Calgary and Edmonton-Toronto. Efficient check-in procedure with Westjet staff on hand to help if needed. Queues never long and with a healthy luggage allowance I was happy. Plenty of leg room on the planes and cabin crew were fine. Flights departed and arrived as scheduled with minimal fuss.

### Jet Airways customer review
We flew from Toronto. The flight took off on time and the cabin crew were courteous. Onboard announcement in English was not legible while the recorded French one was good. Food and service were good.

### Jet Airways customer review
Prince George to Vancouver. Not only were the check in staff polite and friendly they helped me tape my hula hoop onto my pack so I wouldn't have to pay an extra $22 for extra luggage. It then had to be untaped and re- taped at the oversized baggage check (because my pack was now too large to go through the scanner and had to be searched by hand). Staff were all very nice to me which I really appreciated. Onboard staff are friendly helpful and have a laid-back vibe. Great to have a complimentary hot or cold drink and snack even though it's such a short flight (1 hour).

### Jet Airways customer review
HNL-YVR overnight flight on 737-800. Friendly efficient FA's served juice and cookies. AVOD in each seat but the TV channels did not work until close to Vancouver. Friendly and prompt telephone service prior to flight including call-back service. Easy-to-use web site.

### Jet Airways customer review
Flew YYC-LAS roundtrip. Check-in people were friendly and courteous. We were processed quickly. Received bags at both locations fairly fast. Only one beverage run during the entire 2 hr 38 min flight. Two complaints. We found the seats to be narrower than average and we were not sure we would want to fly for a longer time. Secondly approx 1/3 of the TV channels were not offered due to various issues. Disappointing when they advertise 24 channels and you only get about 15 of which few are children oriented. The screens are also very small.

### Jet Airways customer review
My partner and I were on a flight from Hamilton to Grande Prairie and due to unforeseen circumstances our flight was cancelled. I was very pleased with the service we received from the West Jet personnel from the Hamilton airport. We were re-routed to Calgary and West Jet picked up the tab for our overnight at a hotel and we were placed on a connecting flight the following day. The flight attendants they were personable and entertaining.

### Jet Airways customer review
Booked direct flights to and from Orlando only to learn several days later that they had change the flights to multi- stop flights - 2 on the way down and 1 on the way home. Could book through other airlines for less money if I wanted to make stops. Booked WJ for the direct flights. Consider this false advertising.

### Jet Airways customer review
YYZ-YOW. Very fast boarding. On-time. Not a minute late. Plane was Half full comfortable seats. I'm 6 Feet and leg room was nice for me. nice flight attendants always smiling. My only complain would be the screen. The screen is very small and only a few good things come one. But for a 1 hour flight I was fine.

### Jet Airways customer review
Abbotsford B.C.-Edmonton Alta. My plane landed at Edmonton at 12:50pm. I was seated in the last row of the airplane. Upon standing up to leave we were asked to sit down until the people going to Toronto left the plane. I have never transferred on a flight before so I followed the people leaving the plane. They all went downstairs to the luggage area. I knew I didn't need to get my luggage because they told me it would be put on my next plane for me. I stopped at the information desk and asked where I was suppose to go for my ticket. I was told to hurry up the stairs and go through security because I was going to miss my plane going to Grande Prairie. When I got through security I was told I had missed my plane and to go and see West Jet about getting on another. I was told it was my fault that I missed my plane and I was dawdling around. I told them exactly what happened and they said that was not so and I should have known not to come downstairs. I should have known to just get off the plane and get right on the other one. No one ever told me this nor did they ask me if I knew. I should have been let off the plane along with the people leaving for Toronto so I would have made my flight. I had to pay another $52.50 to get on the next plane. I am very disappointed in the way West Jet handled this and how they treated me. Never mind waiting another 9 hours in the airport to catch the next flight I should not have had to pay $52.50 for it. Air Canada told me that they would not have charged me for the ticket because it was not my fault.

### Jet Airways customer review
YYZ-YYC return. I appreciate the online check-in and ability to print my own boarding pass. On the return flight we were able to switch to a later flight with no problems. Both flights were on time with zero delays at either end. Friendly staff were available to help with printing of luggage tags at the kiosk. The luggage allowance is generous and bags appeared promptly after each trip. Boarding was smooth and organized. The planes were clean and comfortable and not super hot as some planes are. There were a variety of free TV channels available. The best thing about flying Westjet was the ability to get answers to questions about flights quickly and personally. When their help lines were busy I was able to leave my phone number and was called back promptly.

In my experiences with Air Canada there has been no customer support when things go wrong or the passenger has questions; being left with an un-answered phone line or endless automated phone menus does not count as customer service. Kudos to Westjet for placing their passengers at the top of their priority list! In these times of high fuel prices and competition between airlines Westjet stands out for both quality and service.

### Jet Airways customer review
YWG-YVR return. Check-in slow have to drop your bags on the belt. Flight was fairly full poor boarding once on board FA's did their job that's about it. Selection of IFE was ok have to purchase movies AC is free. Buy on board food was avg. Arrived on time bags were fairly quick. The return a week later delayed an hour out of YVR no explanation or apology. Similar service not great FA's were downright rude chatting in the back. One water run was made throughout the whole flight. Bags arrived quick. Only reason I took WestJet was because the AC flight was sold out that day.

Edmonton-Toronto-Edmonton over the long weekend. Flight there perfect - full but more than enough room. On time pleasant crew no complaints. Food sold and of poor quality. All bags arrived quickly. Return sat on the runway for over 1 hour because of a storm. The satellite system died and the flight deck gave no updates and failed to mention for a half hour that the runways were all closed - the flight attendants kept telling us we would depart "shortly". Overall it was cheaper than Air Canada and just as good if not better.

### Jet Airways customer review
Very old planes no comfort and meals are expensive. No reading lights my table was broken. It's low-budget but doesn't worth it.

YVR-OGG return B737-800. Pre-booked online several months previous with seat selection for both legs. Generous baggage allowance at that time 2 checked bags 50 lbs each per passenger no cost. Now only one bag for free but this is still better than many other airlines. Check-in at YVR was quick no big lineups and assistance by WestJet staff was available for people who hadn't printed their boarding passes ahead of time. We had ours already so were able to go straight to check-in. Boarding is unstructured. I don't recall hearing an announcement for seniors or families with babies/toddlers to board first. Likewise there is no boarding based on seating assignments. It still seemed to go fairly smoothly but we were near the front of the line and also seated up front on both flights so were on board and seated early. The flight out to Kahului was delayed about 1/2 hour (may have been longer) due to a passenger being detained at US immigration and subsequently the airline had to remove her luggage from the plane. While we were waiting to depart the head FA requested two passengers from the first 6 rows volunteer to move to seats at the back of the plane (failing volunteers two passengers would have been selected and asked to move). Seats were comfortable with lots of leg room. IFE cut out after being airborne for about 1/2 hour after which it was movies only for 5.99. Gone are the days of free entertainment and meals. Free snacks (cookies bits & bites) and soft drinks tea coffee etc provided. Leaving Kahului was also straight-forward with no long lineups at check-in. Flight was smooth and again the FAs were friendly and helpful. Flight schedules both ways were good leaving YVR at 9:40 AM and leaving Kahului at 2:05 PM so nothing extreme either way. Baggage unloading at OGG was fairly quick but YVR seemed to take a very long time. Planes on both legs of the journey were clean and comfortable and both flights were enjoyable (screaming toddlers on the return flight notwithstanding). This was our first time traveling with WestJet and we would use this airline again.

I flew back to Victoria from Winnipeg. The checkin time was 4:15am checkin lady was not in a good mood ordering me around with my luggage and generally being short there was no one else in line! I asked for a window seat and went for the security gate I then waited for most people to board. As I got to my seat I saw I was in the only seat without a window this was not good if I can't see out I get motion sickness. The flight didn't level off before I was feeling very uncomfortable - it was the worst flight I have ever experienced. If someone asks for a window seat there might be a reason. The checkin lady should have known that there is no window seat in the row she placed me or did she place me there on purpose.

YWG-PHX return. Friendly service outbound but the return flight wasn't their finest. The only good thing was that it left on time. The flight was hot and uncomfortable the crew seemed disinterested for the most part and only a couple of channels on the tv were working all of them news channels and their flight times on the way back are awful (gets in at 1:00 am).

I've flown Westjet often especially between Vancouver Island and Calgary and have been generally satisfied with flights and service. However on March 31st I took a connecting flight from Calgary to Palm Spring - hunger took over and I had no choice but to buy a snack. What a very poor selection! In desperation I tried the Ham and Cheese Sub. and took only a few bites it was terrible for two days following I suffered an upset stomach. Isn't it possible to serve a fresh sandwich?

Recently I booked a direct flight from Saskatoon to Abbotsford with a 45 minute stop in Calgary. With no prior warning we were asked to deplane in Calgary and see the WestJet agent at the gate for an announcement. When we reached the gate we found out that WestJet had taken our plane and rerouted it to Mexico and said that they second leg of our flight would be in 2 hours. That flight was cancelled and we ended up spending 11 1/2 hours in the Calgary airport. There was no apology or explanation from WestJet. While they did provide meal vouchers. Considering I was expecting a 2.5 hour flight and it ended up taking nearly 14 hours I would hope that WestJet would have a customer service representative to talk to. When I called the Super Centre I was told that there was no one for me to speak to and I should use their feedback section on their web page. I asked the agent how long I could expect to wait to receive a reply and I was told approximately 5 weeks. This is totally unacceptable. WestJet will be my last choice as an airline from this point forward.

Cancun to Vancouver BC boarded the plane on time but sat there for an hour and a half before being allowed back into the terminal. Told by the pilot the ground crew had "scratched the plane" and needed approval from Calgary to fly. After another hour and a half in the terminal we re-boarded the plane and sat there for at least another hour and a half before we took off. We were told by the pilot we would receive compensation from Westjet but 6 weeks later have heard nothing. Very friendly good equipment but a drink and a sandwich would have gone a long way.

YYC-YYZ-CCC return. Booking a Westjet vacation was easy staff friendly. Not much price difference between Westjet and Air Canada vacations. YYC to YYZ leg uneventful check in cheerful and helpful. T3 has more places to eat with good service. Flight was okay cheery cabin crew. Paid extra for exit row when it used to be reserved for tallest passengers. Irks one to see a 5'3 person in there when you have tried to book it. The sandwiches were not bad all other snacks were junk food. No entertainment system to or from CCC but it is sat TV. Westjet staff in Cuba superb. Only real beef is no direct WJ flights YYC-Caribbean. The stop in Toronto is a pain. Value for money question is difficult to say as the distinction between AC and Westjet is blurring as Air Canada appears to be trying harder.

São Paulo - Rio de Janeiro / SDU to Belo Horizonte return. 2 airplanes offering very nice comfort for a truly low-cost Airline. The other B737-300 offered average comfort showing a bit of real age. I paid only 60USD for the return flight - a quarter of the price of the competitors. All flights in time except for the CFN-SDU one delayed for an hour.

Service on flight was fine seat space good but as their flights seem to consist of multi-stop flights down the Atlantic when the flight was delayed at the beginning it accumulated into a 2.5 hour delay and as Infraero provides the staff for check-in the only WebJet employees disembarked on the plane just to check us in. We spent an hour and a half just with the flight displayed as "delayed" then the flight arrived 30 minutes later than it had delayed. The embittered passengers did form a sort of camraderie and the airline staff were profusely apologetic (although as noted they do not offer alcoholic beverages with which to reward us). The price was almost half of TAM or Gol (one-way was around R$100/US$60) and the planes themselves were well kept and quite comfortable. Don't know if this was just a bad day or not its just a very small low-budget carrier.

We were very impressed with the excellent service both going to Calgary and returning home to Victoria - both my husband and I needed some assistance in the terminals and were given very kind and courteous care at both terminals!

Vancouver to London Ontario via Calgary. I was impressed with the service and the efficiency. For a low cost carrier they are far better than Easyjet and Ryanair - in service comfort and value for money. Westjet were excellent by comparison.

YYZ to YKA via YYC and back. I haven't flown Westjet in a number of years but I would say that their offering is comparable to Air Canada economy class. All three flights were more or less on time and trouble free. Seat pitch feels similar to Air Canada. I didn't purchase any food so can't offer an opinion on this. Air Canada's inflight entertainment is somewhat superior - they offer a wider variety of audio and video entertainment gratis while Westjet offers certain TV channels for free and premium programming (Movies and certain TV programs) at additional cost (there is a slot to swipe a credit card in the seatback to pay for this). I did find it annoying that the channel displaying the aircraft's position (a personal favorite) was 80% Westjet advertising and only 20% map. Overall I find the offerings of the two airlines to be quite similar and wouldn't hesitate to fly Westjet over Air Canada if they offered a lower fare or a more convenient itinerary.

YYZ-YYC-YYZ. Outbound flight comfortable but a bit late. Return leg just as comfortable and was on time. Inflight service good entertainment was entertaining. Only complaint was the length of time it took for "special handling" luggage to appear upon return to YYZ. Overall good value and will fly them again.

### Jet Airways customer review
Has anybody noticed that you since a few months ago cannot check in to the front half of the aircraft by web check in? The front half of the plane is blocked out yet when you get on the aircraft there may be half the seats available. West jet advises that those seats are held for counter staff to have some flexibility. The other option they provide is to pay $10.00 at time of check in.I spend $10000 per year on West Jet but they are really nothing special anymore.

### Jet Airways customer review
YYZ-LAS-YYZ I normally would have flown Air Canada on this route but they wanted double the price than what Westjet charged and I decided to give Westjet a try. Hassle free departure from Terminal 3 at Pearson (unlike Terminal 1 with understaffed US customs and brusque security staff). Outbound flight on equipment that felt aged with cheery staff relentlessly pushing whatever food they are selling. Tiny TV screens on back of each seat negate considering paying $5.99 to ruin watching a movie. Free TV programs for those who care. Return was in a brand new 737-800 that was not equipped with ANY in flight entertainment system as it had not been outfitted with such yet. One was advised to purchase reading material before one boarded. For a no frills airline it compares well to Southwest in its attitude and service and makes Air Canada look very overpriced indeed if one can substantially save on the fare on the same route as I did.

### Jet Airways customer review
SFO-YVR return. Decent no frills airline that get you from point A to point B without all the glitz. Friendly cabin crew soft drinks and cookies served at no charge. Other snacks blankets and pillows available for a charge. The $7 charge for a blanket is excessive. Best feature is the two checked bags at no charge. Would fly again.

### Jet Airways customer review
SDU-BSB BSB-CNF and SDU-POA. All flights cheaper than the competition. Not a good first impression when Webjet had to transfer all passengers to Galeao Airport as their B733 couldn't land at Santos Dumont due to bad weather even though other airlines were operating. The genuine smiling crew made up for this though. All other flights left within a few minutes of scheduled time. Legroom a little tight but nothing too bad. Cabin crews invariably very friendly and welcoming. They appear to enjoy their jobs - I overheard one lady in particular discussing the company with an elderly passenger who hadn't flown with them before and she was very knowledgeable and was marketing the company well. Small snacks and complimentary drinks served on all sectors. Ground crew friendly and informative too. The only annoying thing is non-Brazilians have to book by phone or at the airport as the website isn't set up to receive bookings by foreigners.

### Jet Airways customer review
São Paulo (GRU)-Brasília (BSB) and back all-economy 737-300. Simple Web site but functional easy to navigate book and buy - however in Portuguese only. Seat allocation can be reserved only by phone. Decent fares no surcharges transparent rules frequent promotions. Very friendly and efficient staff both on the ground and aboard; one can see they were very well trained and enjoy their work - a rarity today. Immaculate plane inside (in spite of a few worn paint spots on the fuselage) seat pitch better than in Gol or TAM. Announcements in English for foreign travelers. Food is a cold sandwich small but not microscopic and a small sweet - both very good. No alcohol but plenty of soft drinks fruit juices and mineral water. Punctuality was impressive - not a single flight delayed on the airport panels on both legs. The only real minus I saw was a very long time on the ground in stops (50-60 minutes) while one waits inside. My flights were nonstop but were it not so I'd be annoyed with that. Overall I was impressed and definitely recommend Webjet. It was a really pleasant surprise.

### Jet Airways customer review
This airline is for day trips and short hops. I would not recommend it for connections with other flights or any place where you expect to carry more than one bag. It is cheap compared to Alitalia (which can be shocking in price sometimes for some rather short flights.) For the price the service was as expected and I'd fly them again but I would not recommend them to finicky fliers strictly a no frills operation.

### Jet Airways customer review
Just back from return trip to Dubai. It was everything we hoped it would be. From the moment we stepped through the door at the Silverjet Lounge in Luton to arriving in Dubai it was smiles and excellent service from all the staff. It was the same on the return trip. On the outward flight with the window blinds closed it was hard to believe that we were actually on a plane. The food and drink served on board were excellent. We shall certainly use Silverjet again to return to Dubai.

### Jet Airways customer review
Luton to Newark return - absolutely fantastic. First class service from first class staff . An absolute pleasure to fly with Silverjet and well worth travelling down from North Yorkshire. No complaints whatsoever only praise.

### Jet Airways customer review
Return flight to Dubai in May. The whole experience from arrival at Silverjet terminal flight itself arrival in private terminal in Dubai and the return journey was a delight. The flights arrived early in both cases the in-flight service was exceptional food was excellent and the seat although a bit narrower than some other business class flights was fine too. The best aspect is the private terminal in Dubai just having to avoid the main terminal and all associated hassle makes such a difference. I hope the airline goes from strength to strength whilst keeping the excellent prices under £1000.

### Jet Airways customer review
Fantastic flight to Dubai last week excellent lounge and on board service both ways. Am glad that the cash injection will help them stay around.

### Jet Airways customer review
Excellent flight to and from EWR last week. Great service in the lounge and in the air on time both ways.

### Jet Airways customer review
An excellent trip with Silverjet to Dubai - the lounge was a wonderful haven and the check-in process really can't be beaten. On-board the seat was comfortable if somewhat narrow but no rival for BA CW or Virgin UC - however as fares can be more similar to their premium economy products it really is fantastic for what you are paying. Other small things - the on-board entertainment was a little limited and would have benefited from more variety and the central tables could have done with being a little wider to accommodate the consoles. My main criticism would be the time it took to serve the food on the night flight to Dubai - given that it's a relatively short flight taking 2 hours to serve the food really isn't acceptable as this leaves very little time for sleep. Perhaps Silverjet could consider taking food bookings during the check-in process and have the food heated up ready for departure. Having said that the food was tasty certainly better than some of the appalling meals found in Virgin UC. The lounge in Dubai was very crowded when we arrived and didn't have the greatest selection of food or drink but the immigration process was at least stress free - as long as you are not the last to be getting your passport back. It was pleasing to see that the plane was nearly full - and seemed to contain a mix of business and leisure passengers. I hope Silverjet succeed as despite the niggles they really were a wonderful way to travel.

### Jet Airways customer review
Luton to Dubai return. Don't rely on the Silverjet car service to pick you up in Dubai they admitted to me after it failed to show up at my hotel that they were having problems with it. Also seats do not fold fully flat and if you are tall like me difficult to get comfortable. At Dubai the aircraft sometimes has to park a long way from the VIP terminal and means a long bus ride. Terminal too small it has to hold arriving and departing passengers at the same time so you may not have anywhere to even sit. Terminal at Luton quite crowded not always easy to find a seat. A disappointing experience if you have paid the full flexi fare price. If you have got a saver ticket then fair value.

### Jet Airways customer review
I've just endured a night of going nowhere except a 2 hour flight over the English countryside. The Dubai flight was due to depart at 2155 and we boarded on time. We then sat on the plane for 3 hours while a fault was fixed. I should say at this point that the crew were excellent and served us all whatever we wanted from the bar and did their best to provide information. When we finally took off the pilot soon broke the news that the fault had re-occured during take off and we had to return to Luton after burning off some fuel hence the flight going no-where. When back on the ground at 0400 the ground crew really tried their best to provide options but when you have such a tiny fleet these options didnt include transfering to another plane sadly. And that sums up Silverjet I think. When it works it really is fantastic. When there are problems although the staff are first class they simply do not have the infrastructure to properly deal with it.

### Jet Airways customer review
Turin to Catania and back operated by A320. I am satisfied by this airline you can save a lot of money obviously you have to renounce the on board service; however the flight assistant are kind and smiling. The pitch of seats is acceptable. To conclude Windjet is basic but very professional and confortable airline.

### Jet Airways customer review
Luton to Dubai. Great experience with Silverjet to Dubai. At Luton we chose valet parking and left the car outside the door of the Silverjet lounge. Lounge at Luton is great better than BA club lounges. The plane was 90% full which was good to see because Silverjet deserve to succeed. At Dubai you get off the plane  bus to VIP terminal sit down in the lounge while they stamp your passport and then you leave luggage lined up outside ready to go in the car! ten times better that the usual Dubai terminal experience. Return flight was very relaxed cabin crew excellent. food was very good. got off the plane at Luton walked to baggage reclaim  cases already there walked out of terminal to find car waiting 50 m from the door. Excellent! My only criticism would the poor selection on the inflight entertainment but that is certainly not a big deal. I would recommend Silverjet for Dubai over Virgin Emirates or BA. I still have my luggage!

### Jet Airways customer review
LUT - EWR Return. My second round trip to the US with Silverjet in 6 months.This time around I used the transfer taxis from Parkway station there was one waiting and I was transferred to the terminal immediately. Lounge and check in at Luton once again a unique experience. I would recommend that you put your US first night address via the online check in I think it just makes the whole process even more straightforward in the lounge as the staff literally just have to get your boarding card. Outbound there were pre-flight drinks and the seat was fine. I worked for 5 hours using the in seat power for my laptop. Inbound I was on the late flight but it turned out they had cancelled the earlier flight and so combined the two so the late flight was full all but 4 seats. As mentioned previously this places a bit of a stretch on the Newark lounge. On board I spotted some empty seats behind me and asked if they could be used but was told there were not working properly they later sprung to life and I was moved to two empty seats enabling me to spread out. Overall another excellent Silverjet experience. The day after I got back I read in the business news that they haven't yet posted a profit but have made their lowest loss so far after flying for just over a year.

### Jet Airways customer review
I flew with my four and a half year old daughter on the 10am flight to Newark. This was our 3rd flight with Silverjet. As our previous experience with them was so exceptional; and we had a very tight three night turnaround; we opted once again to fly with them. My husband drove us through a blizzard to the terminal on the morning of the flight. As we expected there was a delayed take-off due to the need for de-icing. The ground crew were delightful and allowed my husband to join us for coffee before we boarded. Once onboard I enquired about the child pack for my daughter. I was told that you now give these out in the terminal. Flight crew were very apologetic and I was assured that one would be waiting for us upon arrival and it was! The last 45 minutes of the flight were extremely turbulent. I have never been sick during air travel before but actually became hideously sick during landing. I was terribly embarrassed and also concerned for my daughter as I knew she was frightened. The cabin crew were all so supportive kind and reassuring. They were professional and helped my daughter as well. I was met at the plane with a wheelchair by a wonderful young woman. She took care of everything right up until I got into the town car and reassured my young daughter all the way through. On our return to Newark for the 7:30 return flight to Luton we were greeted by the same young woman who had assisted me and the other ground crew. We were greeted by name and asked how I was feeling. The flight to Luton was excellent and I my daughter and I both slept for 5 hours. We arrived early to Luton and it was wonderful to be able to return to the terminal where we were greeted once again by name! Is the lounge or the seat as good as Virgin upper no; but the service and check in is superior. One thing to note is how child friendly they are. Silverjet now offers a child discount on all tickets as well. I am looking forward to my next flight with them in July.

### Jet Airways customer review
Luton-Dubai. We found the whole experience a delight from the moment you arrive at the Silverjet lounge at Luton you are being looked after. Cabin crew were attentive and helpful. On arrival in Dubai we still felt we were being treated as special.

### Jet Airways customer review
LTN-EWR Return. We just flew this airline for the first time and can strongly recommend it. We caught a train (frequent service) to Luton Parkway from central London and were transferred to the Silverjet terminal by complimentary taxi. All relatively straightforward. Check in was the best I have ever experienced- staff take your passport and whilst you sit in the lounge enjoying breakfast they complete the check in procedure. Very stress free. Our outgoing flight was an hour late in departing due to adverse weather conditions but passengers were kept updated and the pilot himself came into the lounge to introduce himself and explain what was happening. This was representative of the whole experience - staff friendly (they ask onboard how you wish to be addressed) and courteous but informal which is a very pleasant departure from other airlines I have been on. Food was better on the outbound leg and the departure lounge in New York is a little small but overall this was one of the best airline experiences I have ever had and despite the inconvenience of leaving from Luton will certainly be using them again. Re previous comments about passenger numbers - our flights were both running at about 80% full - I only hope that this continues to improve as this airline deserves to succeed.

### Jet Airways customer review
EWR-LTN return. I strongly recommend Silverjet. The check-in procedure is a revelation. No check- in counters Silverjet staff takes your baggage and passports invites you to sit in their private lounge and bring you your boarding pass. Onboard service was excellent. Seats extend to flat but not to fully horizontal. On evening flight from NY food service was quick allowing an overnight sleep. Both flights approximately 75% full. Luton Airport may be a bit far from London compared to Heathrow but with the expedited boarding at Silverjets private terminal the total time door to departure is the same. This is biz class for less than half the price of the majors. Give it a try.

### Jet Airways customer review
LTN-DXB. Check-in and boarding at Luton was incredibly easy and personal and the private terminal was very comfortable and spacious with very nice shower facilities (food not worth mentioning). This makes up for the headache of accessing Luton airport from Central London. Onboard food was below par. The cabin although comfortable and new was nearly empty on this flight. Arrival at the VIP terminal in itself almost makes the entire trip worth it as there is no hassle or waiting in Dubai's notorious passport control queues. However there was some confusion in finding where to go as this is currently the only commercial airline that uses this terminal and Silverjet staffing here was sparse. After wandering into a private waiting area a few of us were ushered upstairs by a non- Silverjet employee to the correct facility. Agents casually take your boarding passes and return them to you as you relax in the very upscale facility. However their Dubai lounge inconveniently lacks shower facilities and the staff is not subtle about rushing you out as they have shift focus to greeting departing passengers going back to Luton. Silverjet has some issues to iron out but overall is a product worth giving a try.

### Jet Airways customer review
I flew Silverjet for the first time. A fantastic level of service from start to finish. Excellent airport lounge away from the crowds and with Silverjet passengers able to enjoy a range of food wine champagne fruit juices newspapers and facilities such as showers. The service onboard is as good as the best with personal entertainment systems and friendly yet professional service. The meals onboard were delicious.

### Jet Airways customer review
LTN-EWR return. The product remains unbeatable value in my view. Valet parking at Luton is quick and easy and private security line is almost the best bit - it just saves so much time. Onboard the new menu was an improvement and the wines also. In pure value and service terms I dont think they can be beaten.

### Jet Airways customer review
Luton - Newark return. Luton experience is worth the price alone and the little things show the thought they have put in to the whole experience. I loved the fact there's no announcement to the gate - just someone politely informing you which door to go through. Inflight experience equally superb - even being asked how I wished to be addressed by FA; and proper food/wine. Newark's a great airport - efficiently through Immigration (don't think there was a dedicated lane though??) and although the Lounge is not as good as Luton it's still great and you still get a quick easy check- in and great service. My only worry for the long term is that both flights were only two-thirds full and with Maxjet going under recently - does the model work?? Hopefully it does as we'll definitely use them again!

### Jet Airways customer review
Everything was amazing apart from the late arrival into Newark on the return. Seats entertainment and food amazing. FAs friendly. Fly Silverjet -its worth it!

### Jet Airways customer review
LTN-NY and back. Staff on the ground and in the air all very helpful and could not do enough. The lounge facilities are great the private (at Luton) and fast track (at Newark) security worth the price alone. In 35 years of travelling to the US I have never been in and out so quickly. I paid less than BA Traveller Plus or Virgin Premium Economy. May Silverjet prosper and add more routes!

### Jet Airways customer review
LTN-DXB :no stress of having to frantically scan a big LCD screen every 10 mins to find your check in and gate number there is only one! No unwanted numerous announcements one after another telling you its your final call simply a polite invitation in person to mention that you may board. I think there were only two during the entire journey start to finish a captains brief on departure and arrival. Courteous security - they do they exist here. Enthustastic cabin crew who smile and talk to you Delicious food and a comfortable bed. On arrival Champagne breakfast with unlimited coffee at exec lounge Dubai again 'personal' treatment.

### Jet Airways customer review
Like a breath of fresh air. Came across Silverjet by chance during Dec scrambling to get flights to Dubai for family holiday. Silverjet takes all the hassle and stress out of immigration into Dubai. Staff at every junction could not be more cooperative.

### Jet Airways customer review
My fourth trip with Silverjet and it is an outstanding service especially for the price. Although Luton is a little further than Heathrow and Gatwick for me there's no time needed for check-in so overall it's quicker than fighting the crowds in a London airport. The lounge at Luton is outstanding service onboard is friendly and efficient food is excellent and it's a comfortable seat which is almost lie flat. As others have said the Newark lounge is not as nice (it's comparable to many other business lounges but not as good as the one at Luton). The last time I went I took my wife and eldest daughter (so there were three of us) for the same cost as flying one person in Virgin Upper.

### Jet Airways customer review
Silverjet last week from Luton to New York. The Silver lounge is peaceful relaxed and without fault - staff couldn't do enough for us. Onboard crew were a pleasure. The food was by far the best I have had on a flight. The only criticism I have was the lounge in Newark which was in no way comparable to Luton. It was too small for the amount of people in there - but I'm sure that will improve as it becomes more established.

### Jet Airways customer review
London - Dubai. Flight a real pleasure but the main reason to fly to Dubai with Silverjet are the private terminals. Valet parking at Luton no queue for check-in or security. At Dubai we were ushered into the lounge and our passports were stamped with visa while we had a glass of champagne. They were returned shortly and our bags were ready to collect from the from the front of the terminal near to taxis. Anyone who has flown into Dubai will know what a difference this makes.

### Jet Airways customer review
Another superb Silverjet flight Luton to Dubai leaving on New Years Day. Crew very professional friendly and have a smile you can see is not fake. My only worry is that on the 3 occasions I have flown Silverjet between London and Dubai the planes have been virtually empty so I sincerely hope that the numbers pick up as it would be a great shame if they had to stop the service.

### Jet Airways customer review
Flew to Dubai and service brilliant. Private terminal at Luton check in arrival and departure at private terminal in Dubai marvellous. One has to pay more than twice to experience this service with other airlines. Silverjet staff are friendly and helpful.

### Jet Airways customer review
Luton-New York-Luton. I felt the crew were not as experienced as an airline like BA but they were very friendly. Meals tasty. I appreciated the personal space in a cabin that's all business class. A small point but there were no trolleys. Everything was served individually from the galley on a tray which felt more special. Inflight amenity kit was disappointing presumably a money saver. Luton surprised me as an excellent airport or at any rate the Silverjet terminal which is outside the main terminal. Check in at Luton and at Newark was at the entrance to the Silver Lounge close to where the taxi drops you off. I thought this arrangement was much better than queuing at desks with other airlines. Silver Lounges had snacks and drinks available including champagne and a good selection of magazines and newspapers and Luton had its own security channel which was hassle free. A different way of flying transatlantic and in almost every way much better.

### Jet Airways customer review
I have heard of their demise today a great disappointment. My first experience with them was arriving with my wife at STN last year to hear of the last minute cancellation of our IAD flight due to supposed mechanical failure (underbooking more likely). We were immediately flown out to NYC on Virgin Upper Class from LHR after an M25 dash and transferred to Washington on the next day following a dreadful overnight stop near JFK. Our return flight from IAD was excellent in every respect. Having taken up our initial experience with their PA department on our return I heard from them three weeks later - with an offer of two free return flights to anywhere on their network. We took this up in June for a California flydrive via LAS. Outward flight was again excellent in every respect and Stansted was a revelation - but Maxjet let themselves down with a 3 hour delay at LAS on the way back because of a glitch over catering equipment that left them with the need to wash and sterilise the set used on the outward flight. Once we were in the air it was the usual good standard. Had they not gone under we would almost certainly have flown with them again.

### Jet Airways customer review
The Luton experience could not be beaten. We arrived at the Silverjet terminal having pre-booked valet parking. We were met kerbside and invited into the terminal whilst the baggage was unloaded. It took no more than two minutes for the bags to be tagged and the cars keys taken care of and then we were off to the lounge. I would recommend taking breakfast in the lounge prior to the 10.00 departure to Newark. Check in was completed over a coffee in the lounge and the staff changed our original seats to better accomodate our party. From lounge to a/c via a bus was hassle free. On board the crew were very friendly and attentive. The seat was comfortable but mine would not recline fully. As it was a day flight this was not an issue. The in flight entertainment via your own portable screen is great until you want to keep watching a movie whilst dining. There isn't enough room for two screens and two laid up dining positions. We decided to share one screen. The toilets on board are clean but a little functional for a business class service. The food was very good although the pre arrival snack into Newark was very average. the cabin crew were attentive throughout the flight. At Newark we were off the flight and through customs in less than 20 minutes. Our friend in Newark was waiting for us in the Silverjet lounge having been invited to wait for us there. Our return flight was as hassle free as the outbound journey. Other comments on this site cover the lounge at Newark. Crew were again very friendly and professional. Food was again very good although breakfast a little disappointing. The angled lie flat seat was a little uncomfortable for me but everyone else seemed to be sleeping. Arrival into Luton faultless. We were sat in the car bags loaded within 30 minutes of the aircraft landing. The car was parked 50 yards from the terminal when we arrived. The Silverjet staff brought the car to the door of he terminal and loaded the luggage whilst we waited inside. Punctuality in both directions very good. The bottom line is that this is a good product for the price we would certainly use Silverjet again and would recommend them.

### Jet Airways customer review
Stansted to Vegas return - I was worried when Maxjet shares were suspended the day before my outbound flight. But both flights were punctual food good liberal quantities of champagne comfortable seats very reasonable prices. The plane was only half-full so I had a double seat to myself. Staff were helpful though seemed new to their jobs - I could see them reading from the manual as they made various announcements. I can't compare to full- price business class but compared to economy transatlantic flight this was an excellent way to travel for not a great deal more money. I hope Maxjet survive their financial hiccup because the service was excellent and I'd like to travel with them again.

### Jet Airways customer review
Stansted to Las Vegas return. Check-in fast track security and lounge were excellent at Stansted. Service and food on the flight was good (better food than Continental Business First out of Birmingham). Seats old but comfortable and did not mind manual controls. Outbound there was a lingering smell from the toilets in the mid section which the crew sprayed with air freshener a couple of times. Check-in was very good at Las Vegas - no massive line - and the lack of lounge was no big deal given the cost of the tickets. Inbound was a good flight very pleasant crew and altogether a great experience. A much better product than premium economy with other airlines.MAXjet Airways - by Steven Neerkin

### Jet Airways customer review
The whole setup at Luton with a private security channel is very convenient and about as hassle free as an airport experience can be these days. The Luton lounge is decent enough at least on par with an average business class lounge but not nearly in the same league as the Virgin Clubhouse at Heathrow. The Newark lounge is just a partitioned area in the arrivals hall without its own bathrooms etc so left a little to be desired. Also the security at Newark is just the standard lane shared with other airlines. In flight experience was similarly a slightly mixed bag. The flight attendants were friendly but seemed rather inexperienced and the food service was not particularly impressive. But the seat provided a good level of personal comfort which is really what matters most on a long flight. It had a continuous range of adjustments from upright to various reclining angles to (almost) flat and was more than adequate for getting some good sleep. I preferred this to the more plush Virgin Upper seats where the lie-flat design offers no positions between a limited initial reclining range and being turned fully flat. Overall the airline left you with the feeling that they are not quite as slick and professional as they would like you to think as some aspects of the end to end service package seemed a little half baked and improvised. But the positives easily outweighed the minor shortcomings and the bottom line is a great value for the money.

### Jet Airways customer review
Luton to Dubai. Punctuality good service in the lounge was excellent inflight food very good and overall general service great. Seat doesn't recline to flat but I easily managed to get sleep. The lounge at the executive jet terminal in Dubai is a little cramped however the hassle free experience of using that terminal rather than the main one in Dubai is great. My only negative points are that on arriving at Luton Parkway I didn't see any of the Silverjet free taxis and got a wet walking from the bus stop to the Silverjet Terminal. But both are minor points and I will be using Silverjet again on this service.

### Jet Airways customer review
STN-LAS-STN. Overall a very pleasant experience. STN check-in is quick and the Fast-track through security a bonus. The lounge at the boarding gate is a little small. Aside from that it offers all the standard biz-class trimmings. On time departures in both directions we also well received. The 767 cabin is bright and spacious. The website 'tour' of it doesn't do it justice. The seats are very comfortable enabling a comfortable nap but they do not recline to horizontal. On board service is good and the food quality fine although the menu could have a little more variety. This is a better product than the various premium economy services available and I would use them again.

### Jet Airways customer review
I flew Silverjet last Sunday - late leaving my home in Richmond and was sure I was going to be late getting to Luton airport. I arrived 25 minutes before the flight was due to leave and the process could not have been smoother. There was no check in - they took my bag gave me a cup of coffee and brought my boarding card in the lounge. I was onboard 15 minutes after getting out of my car (which they parked for me!). Food was simple but really tasty. Seat very comfortable. The lounge at Newark is small but they have the same check in and boarding process (although security was shared with a BA flight).

### Jet Airways customer review
We have just returned from our first trip on Maxjet STN Las Vegas return. A few more comfortable seats at STN would have been appreciated as we were sharing with a JFK flight and the room was pretty full also a facility at Vegas would have been a bonus. However the fast track check in at Stansted facilities of the lounge punctuality of the flights comfort and legroom willingness and friendliness of staff and quality of the food could not be faulted. Excellent service and value for money.

### Jet Airways customer review
I give them very high marks for product and service - the only let-down is the seat not going 180-degree flat - which hinders sleep a bit as I tend to slide down. The leg rest is firm and presses on my feet but after all these flights I've worked out a solution - sleeping on my front and I don't seem to slide. Service is great food delicious. Canapes menus done by Le Caprice restaurant in London meal service served properly (no tray service) excellent breads and more. Top of the list goes for lounge at Luton - a haven of comfort. It removes the airport experience and passengers board in a calm and relaxed manner. I understand that EWR lounge is being improved. Only once have I had immigration lines at EWR (and this was due to a computer glitch) never any security issues - another huge boon in using this airline. Improvements and changes are constantly being introduced including better wines different catering re-designed lavatories availability of toothbrush & paste etc. Being a small carrier they can easily react to customer feedback and change things quickly. Great value for money with good levels of friendly service and comfortable seating equals a winning proposition for me! My last flights were 99 out of 100 pax outbound 76 out of 100 inbound - so good loads. From disembarking at LTN last month to car = 17 minutes. Speedy. From landing it was all of 26 minutes.

Silverjet LTN to EWR and very impressed with the service. Great seat good IFE and excellent food. The angled flat seat was good for at least 3 hours sleep. The crew were friendly and very attentive. The only points that I think need addressing are the toilets need sprucing up they don't look like toilets on a business class only service and more storage - teres nowhere to store anything around your seat. Apart from these minor points Silverjet is well worth the money and their private lounge at LTN is brilliant and very easy.

Returned from Las Vegas and found the experience a revelation compared to economy class. The leg room is very good (60" seat pitch) with nearly flat seats (160 degrees). The lounge at Stansted was very good and would have been appreciated at Las Vegas where there is not a lounge. Food much better quality than economy. Service on the return flight a little slow due to training of new personnel but not bad enough to ruin the experience. Overall very good value for what you pay and I would not hesitate to recommend this airline to anyone as a superior and cost efficient alternative to economy or prem/economy with major airlines.

JFK to STN. The good - easy and efficient check-in (check in opens at JFK at 4:00 PM for 8:15 PM flight); Good lounge shared with other airlines - good food and amenities and beverages; Good escort through "fast track" security - basically you go to head of reguar security line; Good seats - a little dated but quite comfortable with perhaps 80% recline; Good but not great food served tray style - not like mainstream business airlines. Skip the greasy 3 cheese omelet for breakfast Fruit plate is a better choice.The "not quite up to business class": Crew do not work as a team and appear not to have worked together before; Plane is a little dated (we got the one that had been with some Asian airline given the signs in Chinese characters as well as English) We were kept informed of delay updates (see below) but helpful staff coordinator suffered from lack of information from others. The bad: Captain did not show up but either the original one or another was flown in from Charlotte NC while we waited -- 8:15 PM takeoff became 11:45 takeoff. Would I fly MaxJet again? Yes at the $521 (including taxes) one way fare The key is what others have posted: If you are used to mainstream airline business class you will be disappointed but if economy or premium economy is your experience you will be impressed.

Just flew in this morning on their new service from Luton to Dubai and being a Silverjet first timer I have to say I had a great flight. Being 6ft and of large build I have yet to be able to sleep for anything more than 20mins or so on a flight imagine my delight at having slept for 5.30hrs. The ground crew at Luton very friendly and professional and crew a delight. I think the toilets on board could do with some modernising as they do not reflect the feel of the rest of the plane. Silverjet for me is way to go now when flying London-Dubai and vice versa.

Las Vegas to Stansted Be warned there is no Maxjet lounge at Vegas - and no lounge-sharing arrangement. I was forced to purchase a day-pass to the United lounge. Maxjet have let themselves down very badly in that respect. One of their managers at Vegas told me in response to my complaint that they have been trying for over a year to get some space! Otherwise the trip was satisfactory. I've used them several times before for the STN-JFK-STN route but they always let themselves down with the catering - certainly not the "gourmet" meals that they claim. But overall as on my previous trips with them Maxjet are extremely good value for money.

Return STN-JFK. Until this trip always flown economy class. The experience of not having my knees under my chin came as quite a revelation as did not having to pay £3 for an inflight sandwich. STN to JFK was excellent: fast track security then free drinks and food in the Maxjet lounge. On the plane the cabin crew were attentive and efficient plane left on time food was nice and we arrived 20 minutes early. The return night flight from JFK was not so good: the plane left 2 hours late and the cabin service was amateurish and haphazard. But who's complaining?

### Jet Airways customer review
LTN-EWR-LTN. just flew Silverjet for the first time. Having read the various customer reviews prior to my trip one of the most pleasing thing was to see that various complaints had been addressed by the company i.e. the toilets onboard appear to have been refurbished; ambient temperature onboard certainly was not too high; leaving Newark we had use of the fast track security channel. I found the flight times very convenient. Furthermore there are few flights arriving into Terminal 2 Newark at the same time so security was a wizz. Similarly we arrived back into Luton after the early morning rush so again no waiting. I noticed that a good proportion of the people on the return flight had been with me on the outward journey and i think that this is where Silverjet really scores best as the alternative full fare economy or premium economy is far inferior. If you look at Silverjet as an alternative to BA Club or Virgin Upper you will be disappointed simply because that seats are not comfortable enough.

### Jet Airways customer review
STN-JFK yesterday was a pleasant enough flight. Aircraft a little old but clean (apart from WCs) and very spacious cabin with excellent seats. Food and beverages good as too was entertainment system. The let down the crew. Hopelessly disorganised and unprofessional. Laughing and smiling behind the galley curtains - short sharp and inappropriate in front of the customer. Most well dressed but a couple of the guys very scruffy. Two of the female crew excellent and great ambassadors.

### Jet Airways customer review
Luton-Newark-Luton. I found this for the money an excellent service with just a few niggles. Plus points are the really excellent and stylish lounge at Luton; the quick and simple check-in and boarding procedure there; polite and enthusiastic staff on the ground and in the cabin; the food and its presentation; and general impression of stylishness and design. Personally I find Luton perfectly accessible from central London: trains from Blackfriars (London Bridge Farringdon and Kings Cross are other stops) every 20 minutes or so and a cab to the terminal. There is simply no comparison between the check-in and security experience with Silverjet at Luton and Heathrow or Gatwick whatever the airline and however elevated the class. The niggles: though I had printed out my confirmation and several other web pages my computer packed up a day or so before I left and I could neither check in online nor order a car from Newark to Manhattan. I tried to ring Silverjet to arrange the latter but could find no telephone number on the website; obtained the number from new unimproved directory enquiries but despite my 'phoning several times at various hours over the next two days no-one ever answered. When I checked in they agreed to send an e-mail requesting this but it was almost as if this was an innovative and brilliant solution! I did not find the non-availability of duty-free shopping at Luton any problem - it's the quid pro quo for the private channel: but prospective passengers should be aware of this indeed the website (otherwise informative re the terminals) should state it. I am also quite happy not to have duty-free goods flogged in flight. Arriving at Luton Parkway on a filthy wet day no taxis were evident and none of the station staff seemed to have heard of the Silverjet-branded free taxis as advertised (this despite the fact that they obviously pull up or wait in front all day). A very scruffy and decrepit minicab eventually showed up - quite a way from the canopied forecourt and then a silver 'black' cab. The procedure was not obvious and I got very wet. At Newark I had to wait about 20 minutes in the rather crowded Silverjet lounge before my car came: the ground staff were not efficient in locating me. On that subject I agree with the comments of many other passengers that the Newark lounge is inadequate: but this seems to be a feature of all US so-called premium lounges and no doubt Silverjet has had to be grateful for what it can get. Also Luton sets a very high standard for comparison. Immigration at Newark was amazingly quick for the US and courteous and friendly: and the baggage was already on the carousel. I would agree also that the seat is not as comfortable as it looks especially when reclined (too short and not flat as people have noted). Still pretty good for the money. The outward flight in particular was very lightly loaded with the rear cabin almost unoccupied. Pleasant though it is to fly without crowding I do hope that they get higher load factors or they will not be in business much longer. I do hope there is no truth in the suggestions that flights are cancelled for lack of sufficient passengers - there is no way one is prepared to risk this happening. I would give a 5 but for the niggles and really do hope Silverjet succeeds.

I was due to fly from Stansted to Washington and the flight never got off the ground after them keeping us in the lounge for 5 hours. The ground crew were polite and worked hard to help us but it was clear they were struggling. We were all shipped off to LHR for a Virgin flight (the only partner they have for transfers it would appear) the next morning. They organised taxis hotel and dinner as well as tickets for VS next morning. When I arrived at Virgin next morning they did not have our tickets just as well I left plenty of time. They got some people into Upper some into Premium Economy and the rest (me included) were offered Economy and "2 free return tickets on MaxJet as compensation" - I figured this would let my long suffering wife have a moment of luxury and selected this as they had also run out of Upper tickets ! I have now been chasing these elusive tickets for some 2.5 months 3 emails 5 calls constant promises but no action or return call. Shortly I will lose patience and visit the airport to confront them. The return flight was 5 hours late due to "a technical fault on the place" and they had to move the NY flight out to pick us up. They appear to have no spare capacity at all and a number of old worn 767 units. Other aspects of the flight food was okay service polite seat excellent I would use it if it was reliable but judging from comments in the lounge from other travellers it might not appear so. Add to that the crummy post sales service handling a problem and I cannot recommend them if you need the route for business. Allow for error it would seem likely based on evidence. Sad good idea polite people on the ground under funded poor service record. I only hope that if they do go out of business that this does not stop other people executing this idea more effectively.

I have to say how terribly disappointed we all are having had to cancel our vacation to the USA for next year. We live in London very near to Stansted and were excited about travelling from there rather than Gatwick. Our plans involved Washington DC. We booked our seats early May. I specifically asked about the Washington flight and I have an e-mail guarantee this would not be suspended again. Lies. Suddenly by e-mail not even personally addressed to me I receive notification that our flights home have been cancelled. Offered the alternative of JFK. However we had plans to fly on from Vegas which was our first stop over to Florida and then fly up to Washington for a weekend visit. Our internal flight and hotel was booked on a non-refund basis. So we have lost money big time because of Maxjet Airways. I asked Maxjet for compensation regarding this but all they would offer was $100 per person and then we needed to get to JFK instead. Result = cancellation of flight from Florida to IAD lost £550 ($1000+) - cancellation of Washington weekend hotel & trips £600 ($1200+). We would then need to book a Jet Blue flight from Florida into JFK currently costing $319 per person (total £850 or $1941). Sadly we could not afford all this with just $600 compensation from Maxjet - so our plans are over finished. Maxjet took ages to refund our original ticket price. Reliability and honesty is the key for success. Judgement is out on Maxjet as far as I am concerned. Back to Virgin Atlantic from now on.

First time using MaxJet. Very good service and meal going to Washington (Dulles) staff very friendly and helpful. Return flight delayed 1.5 hours so meal not served till late at night. Would consider using again - shame they dont fly to Atlanta which is where I was travelling onto. I believe the flight I came back on was the last one to Washington.

### Jet Airways customer review
Our first flight with Silverjet and a fantastic experience. Arrived at Luton terminal and had the car whisked away with valet parking - not sure where they park the car but it had 12 miles on the clock when it was returned. The lounge was quite packed but there was still room to sit and relax. Onboard we found the seat comfortable. The aircraft are showing their age but on the whole it was quite clean and tidy the cabin temperature was way to high and found it difficult to sleep comfortably on the return flight. The food and wine on board was excellent and cabin crew good. The lounge at Newark was disappointing and a bit small for a full business flight - we had trouble finding some where to sit together. For someone who has never experienced business class before this is the airline that everyone should try.

### Jet Airways customer review
EWR-LTN-EWR - I decided to give Silverjet a try as I had to make a quick trip to London for a 1 day conference and was not looking to spend the $5000 Continental (my normal carrier) was asking for biz class. I live within 15 minutes of EWR so the perk of only needing to arrive 45 minutes prior to boarding was a huge plus for me. When I arrived at the terminal and finally found the lounge I was a little concerned about what the flight would be like. The lounge is really just a section of the arrivals area that has been cordoned off with a movable temporary wall. There was very little space even though the flight was less than half full but the staff were very accomodating. Boarding went smoothly and we were off exactly on time. I found this to be one of the most relaxing flights I have ever experienced. I will give some of that credit to the half full flight which allowed me to have an empty seat next to me. The seats are pretty narrow as is the arm space between them so I'm not sure how much I would have liked it if anyone but a loved one was sitting next to me. The food was shockingly good - I had the vegetarian option. I managed a good 4 hours sleep which is a record for me. The seats were quite comfortable for sleeping and the blanket was great. Had the chauffeur service in LTN - slight problem trying to locate the driver but it was rectified quickly - transport was a huge and not very comfortable van as opposed to the sedan it should have been. Return - the LTN lounge is really wonderful - one of the better lounges I've been to. Again flight boarded and departed on time. Service was very good food delicious - enjoyed a few glasses of wine and caught up on some movies and decided that I loved Silverjet.

LAX-STN return7. The flight to STN was 75% full and there was plenty of room. The plane appeared tired and old and in need of a good cleaning. The crew was pleasant but so disorganized it was almost comical to watch. They appeared to need a good training class! The food was average. As previously noted it is very difficult to get in or out of your seat if you have a window seat and the person in front has the seat all the way down. The lounge in LAX was a little inconvenient but very spacious and comfortable. Check in was very easy with no lines! The return flight was on a newer plane and the crew was 100% better in their organization. This flight was about 80% full. Stansted lounge was convenient and well stocked. We would definitely fly Maxjet again because we loved the extra space semi-flat seats and the price was right. The fear of cancellation is the only major obstacle so we will always add time on both ends of our trip. We would rate them 3 stars outgoing and 4 stars on the return.

### Jet Airways customer review
Travelled Maxjet to Vegas return from LA to Stansted. With cheapest fare about same as that offered by BA in their sale for Premium Economy there's no contest. There are better business class cabins and seats out there but at what cost. Our flights were on time food and service were good both in the lounges and onboard so I would have no hesitation using Maxjet again. Only worry was LA flight half empty.

### Jet Airways customer review
STN-LAX return. Outbound excellent with smooth checkin fast track security at Stansted and through to lounge. Very good lounge with great food and drinks. Flight left on time as plane was half full. Crew ok friendly enough but definitely not polished like BA. Way back was painful. Our reserved seats were given to a separate passenger but after my partner had a strop they were given back. Lounge at LAX is pretty awful. Flight left on time but it took 2 hours for dinner to arrive. Digiboxes are a pain. Not sure Maxjet will survive as the plane outbound was 50% full and the flight the day before was cancelled which occurs regularly. Still a better product than BA or Virgin premium class as its a lot cheaper and fantastic legroom. Could be a great product if they get it together and advertise their concept.

### Jet Airways customer review
STN-LAS-STN. From fast track at Stansted to excellent leg room and attentive flight crew I can't fault the service. I thoroughly enjoyed the flight (my criticism being the noisy aircraft). Okay it may not be proper business class in the eyes of some but you get what you pay for in this world.

### Jet Airways customer review
Very Annoyed. Maxjet cancelled our flights (via e-mail) on Oct. 9 and they also cancelled the entire route (Stansted to Dulles) so that we couldn't rebook. They suggested an itinerary that would involve a 4.5 hour layover in JFK and a midnight arrival in DC. We're travelling with a 10 month old infant so this was impossible to contemplate on top of a long journey already. I wrote to "customer care" at Maxjet about this on Oct. 10 and also complained about the late notice. Our travel is less than a month from the cancellation date so now we have to scramble for flights and reasonable fares - not easy. Have I heard from Maxjet - despite several repeated requests for "customer care"? NO. Nothing. I'm really just disgusted. I don't think I'll ever hear from them. Very very poor service.

### Jet Airways customer review
Flew Maxjet to Los Angeles and back from Las Vegas have to say the experience was disappointing feel MaxJet jet offers economy class service with old fashioned business class seats. The cabin crew were the worst I have experienced. The digiplayer means you cannot use your tray for meals or work and watch the TV. No pre take -off drink first proper drink offered one hour after take-off meal took forever which on a night flight to wait two hours for the meal to be served is stupid we took off at 19.30 by 22.00 we were still only being offered the dessert. Breakfast was the same slow service and slow to take away the trays which made many of the passengers impatient. Shame as the quality of the food is very good. The basic problem is lack of interest by the cabin crew who seem to respond to people asking for what they want rather that actually knowing what people want. The cabin steward serving our side of the plane went down the isle serving one drink at a time - I had a glass of red my wife had glass of white he went to the front came back with my wife's white wine went back and came back with my red! Why no drinks trolley? If you wanted another glass it was not offered it had to be asked for.

Washington to London Stansted. Excellent check in then directed to Northwest lounge in terminal B which was packed out and only offered limited snacks and drinks. After the scheduled departure time had passed I requested an update from the rather miserable Northwest lounge agent who then told me that the flight was 1.5 hours late. So much for keeping your passengers informed. The flight finally boarded nearly 2 hours behind schedule. The aircraft a Boeing 767-200 is fitted out in a 2x2x2 business class configuration but was only about 50% full. The seats are of the old fashioned business class style so not lie flat but plenty of leg room. We departed for the active runway only to park up with the engines shut down due to adverse weather. So there we stayed parked up at the end of the runway for over 2 hours. The crew did what they could to keep us happy. We were served soft drinks and fizzy wine and were allowed to use our mobile phones. Eventually the aircraft was allowed to take off with a new flight plan whch avoided the bad weather. By that stage I decided to sleep for the rest of the flight and managed 5 hours kip with a reasonable degree of comfort. In the morning I enjoyed a light breakfast with tea prior to landing some 4 hours behind schedule. Maxjet offer a very good and well priced business class product but their timekeeping is questionable.

LTN-EWR Return. LTN private lounge excellent. Plenty of space despite full flight and all amenities expected. Onboard seating comfortable food good wine plentiful. Seat power wasn't working so digiplayer didn't work but rectified by competent crew with a battery. Planes show their age - despite this still very comfortable. On return the lounge at EWR lets the airline down. Comments from ground crew indicate difficulty with EWR in securing a suitable private terminal with cooperation of TSA. I was informed by TSA agent that I could not use the business class security fast track as Silverjet don't pay for it. The lounge at EWR is cramped but acceptable for a business class product. The joy of dropping your bags and being checked in while you sip champagne is still there and worth it. Flight back got 4 hours sleep - found enough space on the 6ft bed (I am 6ft and quite generously built). One adverse comment (it might be the age of the plane) but the temperature of the cabin was too high and the feeling of lack of oxygen was present on both flights.

STN-LAS return. Outbound prompt. Return flight delayed an hour by minor mechanical defect but kept advised by crew. Planes are tired and seats old but they are very comfortable and crew generally try very hard. May not be up to true business class but close and at the price you cannot complain. Only problem with LAS is Virgin Atlantic out of LGW. Depending on slots and delays (appear endemic on VA) Maxjet can arrive just behind a 747 full of passengers so immigration can be a nightmare. First time in many visits to US I've found immigration agent with personality and at pains to apologise for the delays due to VA! Similarly on return if the VA flight is delayed the LAS terminal 2 can become very crowded in the absence of separate lounge facility for Maxjet. Would be delighted to fly Maxjet again. See they have finally acknowledged defeat and cancelled their IAD service from next month.

### Jet Airways customer review
Stansted - Dulles return. We were absolutely delighted with the whole thing. Outward lounge at Stansted very nice and check-in was painless. The flight was comfortable and service exceptionally friendly with very reasonable food. The return flight was not quite as good due to the lounge at Washington not being up to Stansted standard and the flight was delayed a couple of hours due to "unscheduled maintenance" However the seats were comfortable service friendly and we were able to sleep. This surely represents value for money and we will be using it again.

### Jet Airways customer review
I have used Silverjet for the first time in the last week. The whole experience beats premium economy hands down and comes as close as makes no difference to Virgin upper. The fact that it is also far less expensive alternative to premium economy is a nice bonus. The attendants were polite and efficient food as good as I have experienced checking in and Luton lounge a pleasure. This is a new company trying to serve a need in the market with finite resources - there will always be teething problems.

### Jet Airways customer review
STN-LAS and back and have in the past used Maxjet to/from JFK. Delays on both outward (ex STN) flights of 5 and 2 hours respectively but both returns on time. Aircraft old but acceptable seats OK (typical 80's business class) and food only average (not gourmet). Beware pre-assigned seats can disappear for no apparent reason so it is still worth checking in early - our pre-booked seats were not booked when we checked in (despite being assigned when we checked a few days earlier) and handling agent unable to explain why. Tip - try and sit near the front the service often deteriorates the further you sit from the forward galley. Attitude of Manager at STN to seat problem very poor - big false smile on her face whilst she said "seats are not guaranteed we have six aircraft which often change". All the aircraft are 767's and even if configured slightly differently they all have a row 3! My biggest gripe is service on board. Whilst cabin crew in are friendly/polite they take an age to serve drinks each meal course clear up replenish drinks etc. On night flight LAS-STN last Thursday it was 4 hours after take off we got our last course and then waited an age for coffee - not good if you wanted to sleep second half. Unbelievably on a full flight there was just 1 cart serving the cheese/dessert and the coffees making very very slow progress down the aircraft from the front. I was in row 15 - so was getting very impatient. Other airlines run their meal service like a military operation and replenish empty wine glasses along the way routinely and often Maxjet crew faff about and make painfully slow progress. Then whilst this is going on you'll see many of the crew chatting in the front galley maybe clearing up but why not clear up on the second half of the flight when everyone has finished eating and will be asleep - giving the crew plenty of time to do what they want? And don't rely on the crew call button - I saw numerous attempts to attract crew's attention and on hearing the call button "ping" often the attendant(s) did not even look up yet alone look down the cabin to see who was calling. I tried six times to call them while I sat with an empty wine glass before someone bothered to respond. As I said - the crew are friendly and do try but they clearly need better training. It is not a "number of crew to passenger" ratio (though it is poor) because they are often standing chatting in the galley. People want a quicker meal service especially on night flights when they want to sleep later - and there is no reason why you should not have the opportunity to enjoy the full three courses plus a nightcap. MAXjet crew just need to focus and get organised with the meal service and get it done quicker - then pay attention to drinks replenishment. Overall comfortable seats reasonable entertainment (though the content of the digebox a bit dated) reasonable food quality (when you get it) but enjoyment of meal really spoiled by one hour wait (with empty glass) between courses. If you are used to flying economy or premium economy you may enjoy MAXjet but if you usually fly regular business class don't expect anything like the service or attention to detail you have become used to. That said - MAXjet is often much cheaper so it is up to you just know what to expect.

Luton to New York - a wonderful experience. Fabulous seats and food and brilliant service from flight attendants. Our only fault was at the Newark terminal which did not compare to Luton but was still very enjoyable.

IAD-STN return with wife and one kid. Overall a pleasant experience. The seats were roomy and comfortable I didn't make a big deal on the fact that they're the old generation all I care was the fact they I could sleep. The meal was average airplane food we even had lobster tails on the way to London. Plenty of drinks. Both flights arrived on time. Good and responsive service from the flight attendants. The lounge in IAD is ok maybe too crowded the one in London was better. Check-in was fast could access reserved lane at security clearing inspections in no time. Plane 75% full on the way to London and 50% full on the way back to Washington. The only thing we hated was the long and slow line at the immigration in Stansted. Way too slow! We waited one hour in line before to be cleared. The 767 is a little too noisy airplane. I will use Maxjet again.

My wife has flown Maxjet a number of times and raved about onboard comfort and service. So I decided this time to fly with her IAD-STN instead of on United as I usually do. I had the opportunity to experience the main problem with Maxjet - our flight was cancelled on the day of departure. My wife was travelling on a free ticket from a previous flight which had been cancelled. Perhaps Maxjet's motto should be "A superb experience - if you get off the ground". It seems that cancellations are all too frequent on the IAD-STN route and always blamed on a "maintenance problem". I suspect however the real problem is lack of bookings. We were readily re-booked on Virgin Upper Class - a truly awful experience. My wife said the Maxjet service food drink and comfort were far above Virgin. Maxjet assured us we would have free ground transportation IAD-STN. I mentioned this at Virgin check-in at the Virgin Lounge and twice to the flight attendant and was assured that everything was ok. When I checked at the Virgin limo counter at LHR they had never heard of us and upon checking said we weren't entitled to transportation. Virgin could care less about solving our problem. I called the Maxjet UK number and apparently got a rep at the New York call center. She told me to go outside and get a Checker cab and tell the driver it was for Maxjet. I told her I was in London and had never seen a Checker cab there in the last 40 years! She didn't understand and disconnected me. We ended up renting a car at LHR instead of STN even though our destination was only 20 minutes from STN. Maxjet has great on-board service at a very good price - if you ever get a chance to experience it.

Just flew roundtrip STN to LAX for first time on MAXjet. As has been posted previously if you're a business class passenger looking for a deal forget it. If you're economy looking for a deal it's not bad. STN lounge is fine LAX lounge is a joke (being bused out from an airline gate to a business lounge made of prefabricatd buildings is so silly). The planes are old I checked my return plane's FAA details and found it was registered as built in 1985. The seats are the old fashioned mechanical ones toilets I experienced were not really clean cabin noise is surprisingly high and the overall impression is not so good. The service was OK they try hard but food no way "gourmet" it's what you'd expect from airline food. MAXjet is a great concept I support it but they need to do it on a less than creaky budget basis.

LAX - STN and impressed with the service. Although the seats are old style they are not uncomfortable. Food better than Virgin and cabin crew were pleasant. I will use them again.

STN to LAS. Check-in a little slow but friendly fast-track through security and then into the lounge which was very busy due to the delayed LAX flight (although lounge being expanded). Service was very good as was food and general view is that this is great value for money. The planes are not that new but they seem well maintained and comfortable. My only gripe was that there were at least 3 passengers with young children and solo travellers such as myself all got asked to move around the aircraft to accomodate these passengers to have "nicer seats". I am usually happy to do this but one wonders why these people could not have got seats all arranged well in advance (particularly as the flight was not full). It did seem as if the staff were a little too eager to please but just a small moan. Overall a great product at a superb price. It looks like the LAS flights are more likely to be on time than others particularly the JFK flights

### Jet Airways customer review
STN-LAS-STN. Outbound flight excellent. Good cabin crew and food was best we have had on an airline. Return flight delayed due to a member of staff calling in sick - a replacement had to be flown in from Los Angeles. Made me wonder what would have happened if the Los Angeles flight was not on the new roster! Flight home was also good. My concern with is the attitude to safety. I am used to British airlines who have a very strict policy with regards to safety but Maxjet did not ask passengers to be seated when the captain illuminated the seat belt sign. They also allowed an obviously inebriated passenger to sit in the exit seat which should not have been allowed.

### Jet Airways customer review
STN-LAS return. Excellent service both ways from check-in to airport exit. We needed wheelchair assistance and the only problem with that occurred at STN on return but was not the fault of Maxjet though they did sort it out. The only other problem was the Virgin flight arriving at LAS Sept 9 was 2 hours late and caused congestion at security. Same flight was 2 hours late again Sept 16. Flight crew attentive and friendly food good. Could ask for no more. I would fly Maxjet again no problem.

Flew Dulles-London return. The service was very good and staff treated us well. Just avoiding the long security lines since we received premier security check through may have been worth the additional cost. The seats were comfortable and no wait for lavatory use. The food was good. This was an excellent experience for us. Retrieving luggage is much easier because you are not in a crush of 300 other people

Stansted to Las Vegas return. Outgoing flight fast tracked through security. Seats comfortable and inflight entertainment good cabin staff excellent food more than edible. Return flight on time same service as before but captain made up 45 mins so landed early. All in all you get what you pay for and at prices at £600 return they are cracking value for money yes the seats and planes are a little tired but give them a chance. Cant see how anyone could complain about the Cabin crew.

Dulles to Stansted return. We booked our tickets well in advance and paid $1000 each for the roundtrip flight. Check in at Dulles fine. They give you a ticket to go through the priority security screening which is nice. Maxjet uses the Northwest Lounge along with a couple other airlines so the lounge can get crowded. The lounge had the typical selection of drinks and snacks available. On entering the plane I thought the interior had seen better days. The flight was about half full so everyone was able to spread out. The seat was comfortable and a lot of space. I wish they had given a short brief on how to use the seat because I didn't know the leg rest could extend back and forth to fit the legs until the return flight (it's the big black lever in the armrest). My nine year old daughter was able to figure it out and she slept the entire flight. They handed out the digi players shortly after takeoff and started a meal service. I can't comment too much on the outbound service because I tried to sleep. The return leg from Stansted is where Maxjet shines. The check in was quick and fast track through security is great. We made it through security in about three minutes. Maxjet lounge in Stansted outstanding - wide selection of snacks/food as well as drinks. The service on the return flight was fine but it didn't seem as friendly as the first flight. The food was good but it was definitely airline food I think Maxjet is a little liberal using gourmet to describe the food selection. Maxjet is a great value for the money. The seats space lounge and priority security are well worth the price. It looks like they are upgrading the lavs. The interior of the planes are nice with new carpet and the seats are good condition. I look forward to flying Maxjet again in a couple of years.

LUT-EWR-LUT. Outward journey was thoroughly impressive from start to finish. The car valet service happened without a hitch and check-in was over in a minute. The Luton lounge is spacious and comfortable and the 95% occupancy for the flight seemed to be accommodated easily. Security was a breeze and the private bus service to the plane was efficient. On board staff were friendly and attentive throughout and really seemed to enjoy what they were doing. Food was actually as good as I've ever had on a business class flight and the individual attention given to preparing and plating up the food seemed to make a real difference. Immigration and baggage collection at Newark was efficient and our pre-booked chauffeured limo was pretty much ready and waiting. The return journey didn't start too well because of the overcrowding in the Newark lounge. The flight was again full apart from a few seats and the lounge couldn't handle this. I've heard that a new lounge is due to open soon but Silverjet haven't confirmed this. The Silverjet CEO was actually on the flight so hopefully he'll have realised first-hand how unacceptable the current situation is. Take-off was delayed by about an hour because of air traffic control issues. The service on board didn't seem quite as polished as the outbound flight and the food was only average. Sensibly Silverjet offer a two-course meal on the night flight so that one can get the maximum amount of sleep. As others have commented the seats are far from truly flat but comfort wise they're not bad and we both managed to get some sleep. Breakfast is a sort of on board 'take out' i.e. yohourt smoothie fruit and a choice of cheese and ham stuffed croissant or cream cheese bagel in a bag. Not really my ideal for breakfast but probably better than a ghastly reheated omelette and hash browns and certainly easier for the FAs to dispense 40 minutes before landing. Baggage handling at Luton again let the side down but the car valet service was as efficient as on the outward journey. Overall I'd rate Silverjet very highly; better then MAXjet not quite at the level of EOS but then it's half the price.

A brilliant way to travel. My wife and I went to New York for a 4-day romantic break and travel both ways was relaxed and comfortable. We booked the valet parking at Luton and this is how it works. You drive to the front door of the terminal get the bags out of the car and hand the keys over. Walk all of 20 yards to check-in where they take your bags and passports. Then walk a further 20 yards to the lounge for breakfast. A hostess brought our boarding cards to us about 10 minutes later. That was it. Flights both ways were full and on- time. Service was great food was good everything was just right. All the staff were fantastic.

Flew the inaugural flight STN-LAX. Considering we had press and the Maxjet Customer Service Director onboard service wasn't outstanding. The staff spent most of the trip in the rear galley chatting passed through the cabin 5 times (on an 11.5 hour flight) with water and juice for everything else you had to use the call bell. On one occasion a member of staff stood for 10 minutes chatting in the galley and passengers had to get up to get a glass of water rather than be served. The digeplayers had out of date content - last updated March 2007 and I managed to get through 5 sets due to battery life dying - fine as they had spares available as flight was about a quarter full not so great if no spares available! I asked the Purser if I could have the email address of the CEO who welcomed us on board and invited us to give some comments (he asked us to contact him personally with any comments) to be given a dressing down and then told to visit maxjet.com. Clearly she wasn't interested in any customer feedback. Really rather disappointing think I'll stick to UA next time.

STN-JFK return. Travelling with infant. Excellent service by cabin crew however the airline does not cater for young children. Our daughter did not need a bassinet but we noticed that there was no provision to hang a bassinet. Travelling from STN is good with the fast track lane for security however at JFK no adequate provisions for business passengers at security. The 767s are fairly old.

### Jet Airways customer review
Stansted to Washington faultless however the plane had seen better years. The return flight was good with plenty of space - plane being condition however the service on occasions did represent elements of 'Faulty Towers' with a companion being bathed in champagne. Both myself and my wife had two different menus which did not represent the actual menu being offered during the flight. Attention to detail would have made all the difference. However excellent amount of personal space. Based on round trip comparison costs the trip represented good value.

Return Stansted to Los Angeles. Check in at Stansted easy and Fast Track Security. Maxjet Lounge was nothing special and offered the normal fayre you expect. It is a shame it does not have its own washrooms. They started flying the route the day before and I was disappointed with the service offered. One was left to wonder how the crew would have coped had the flight been full rather than just under half as it was. The return to Stansted was a delight - crew were eager to help and made the flight a pleasure. The seats were comfortable but controls took a bit of getting used to. IFE is provided by personal units. As others have said there is an issue over battery life and mine "died" on me on the way back. I would rate them 3 stars for the outbound and 5 stars for the return for value for money.

### Jet Airways customer review
We were standby customers for flights on MaxJet from Dulles to Stansted and Stansted to Dulles flights. We had no problems getting seats on the plane at the time of checkin. Was a little worried since they only have one flight a day but not problems. We had no issues with flights being cancelled. I will say that we left a little later than the scheduled time but we boarded on time so the delay could have been airport traffic. It was great to be served finger foods and champagne before takeoff. You get a salad with bread and your choice of an entree. It will depend which entree you get on how good it is. If you are flying to UK get the fish from UK get the chicken curry or salmon. Deserts are delicious. They also have a deal with the Radisson hotel in stansted so you can shower and eat breakfast buffet (if you have time of course before your connection flight). Everyone was friendly and helpful on the flight. The entertainment unit is good even though there can be issues with batteries running out. Plenty of movies music videos shows to watch.

I recently traveled from Washington DC to Stansted with MaxJet. The flight over was not bad but I thought their gourmet meals were overrated. The trip back was a nightmare. My flight was cancelled and I was flown to JFK instead. I wouldn't have minded this if they had actually gotten me to Washington in time to catch my connecting flight. There was ample time given that the JFK flight was several hours earlier than the original flight. Instead I was given the run-around on the phone pre-flight at Stansted and at JFK as to how I was getting home. At JFK a rep from MaxJet assured us (I had found others who were in the same predicament) that we would be flown on Jet Blue to Washington. Everyone but me was. They couldn't find my name on some list even though I provided them with my confirmation number etc. Long story short I got home a day late having missed appointments and obligations. I have written to MaxJet and have not even had the courtesy of a reply. Please be prepared for any eventuality if you fly this airline.

My husband and I flew from Washington Dulles to London and back in June. The 767 was broken and they substituted an Air Florida 737 with movable ottomans (possible projectiles) and the threat of a fuel stop in Gander. They crew was baffled. They didn't know how to work with the Air Florida crew. MaxJet knew the quality of the service was so far below what was advertised that they offered $500 per person rebated via coupon for future service. Three months later with multiple customer service contacts: not a dime. The return flight was on a 757 owned by the Dallas Mavericks. It was very luxurious and the Team Jet crew worked smoothly with the MaxJet crew. Bottom line: nice people working on a shoe-string with very uneven service. If an offer of reimbursement for under-performance is tendered don't hold your breath. If the plane is broken: you're out of luck.

### Jet Airways customer review
Stansted to Washington last Summer and a positive review. This year we booked Stansted to Las Vegas - what a drop in customer service in a year. Stansted lounge had a smaller range of food and drinks and was packed when we arrived. The crew onboard the outbound flight seemed to think that they were doing you a favour by serving you - the word condescending springs to mind. There were only 2 services this year - fewer than last year. You are expected to serve yourself if you want any snacks. Last year they brought them round to you every 15 minutes. On our return there is no lounge in McCarran airport and no drinks or food vouchers supplied. Again the crew were condescending in their service. I was told off by the purser as my table was at an angle and not directly in front of me. As it wasn't blocking the aisle I didn't see a problem. As others have mentioned the planes are old and it's a nuisance that the DVD player has to move when food is served. The service has gone way downhill in a year although the plane was full. I'd just returned from an economy flight with KLM to China and the service onboard KLM was better than that supplied by Maxjet. The only thing in it's favour is the extra seat width and length. Last year I was keen to book again. This year I'm not so sure.

### Jet Airways customer review
I tried it twice first time disaster second time excellent. It appears the Vegas flight is the winner - if you're going to Washington DC you are in trouble. I wanted to go with Maxjet again this summer but the thought of delays hesitation in giving us the true picture etc made me decide to cash in my Virgin airiles and leave from Heathrow which isn't what I wanted in the first place. I want to leave from Stansted. Maxjet needs to put their house in order; get their pricing right. Until then I search for options.

### Jet Airways customer review
Booked return flight -STN-JFK : outward flight faultless. Got to JFK for our return flight and told that the return flight had been cancelled due to technical problems. The customer services said we had been booked premium economy seats with Virgin to Heathrow at roughly the same time and a taxi would meet us to take us over to STN to pick our car up. We were then transferred to a different terminal to catch the Virgin flight and told that Maxjet had only authorised economy seats for us - as opposed to their promise of premium economy. Maxjet staff basically said anything you wanted to hear in order to move you on quickly! We have since been offered compensation of a round trip back to NY which has so far not materialized but looking at some of the comments from previous people regarding the age of the planes I think we would need to think twice before using again & would not recommend.

Stansted - Las Vegas return. The service was superb as was the lounge at Stansted. We flew on to Vancouver executive class with Air Canada and our experiences with Maxjet were much better than those with Air Canada. We would have no hesitation in recommending the airline to our friends and would fly Maxjet again if it flew to our chosen destination.

### Jet Airways customer review
6th July flight to Washington cancelled. We had no warning and no e-mail to warn us but we checked the flight in the morning and after a lenghty phone call to Maxjet was put on a flight from Heathrow with Virgin economy class. No reason given for cancellation and promised a visit from a Rep when we got to Heathrow. We had to find the extra cost to Heathrow for a start Virgin was not expecting us but rallied round and got us on a flight a no show of course from the Maxjet Rep and so far we have not received a reply to our complaint from Maxjet. I waited as long as I could before I was forced to write this review but it seems they dont really care whether you fly with them or not! Be ready for cancellations and delays and no customer service. On a plus side we did fly back as planned from Washington(delayed) but it was a very comfortable. We had 3/4 hours restful sleep and the service on board was very good. I just dont know if i can trust them enough to use them again which is a shame as it could be such a good service.

### Jet Airways customer review
STN to JFK and flight was fine apart from a number of issues. JFK is a disaster for small airlines as the big boys get priority on departure slots. We waited two hours to be assigned a slot sat nailed to the seat unable to visit the bathroom was no fun for anyone. The endless queues in the immigration lounge also should put off any sane traveller. Other points of interest: The food was good (not exceptional) though service speed was ponderous. The tv system sits on the table and is therefore an aggravation when the food arrives due to lack of room. The choice of films/tv programmes is excellent. The planes are old and the bathrooms are in dire need of a professional upgrade - the current bathrooms have obviously had a paint job but the job was rushed and shabby. FAs are ok - some smile some dont. The seats are fine for the price but don't compare to VA or BA's business class offerings. They are vastly superior to Premium Economy seating. The plane could do with on-screen maps to show the progress of the flight and the PA system is poor. Overall - good flight good airline but still with one or two teething problems.

### Jet Airways customer review
MaxJet to Dulles flight was cancelled I received an e-mail stating this called MaxJet immediately. They re-routed us on the JFK flight and another flight within the US to get us to Dulles the same day. The only inconvenience in this is that we have to leave 3 hours earlier than planned and we have to fly on 3 airlines instead of two. We have not done this as of yet however MaxJet has been courteous and helpful on the phone. I will report back when the trip is complete.

Las Vegas to Stansted. I loved the seats food and service onboard Maxjet. Service was wonderful except that they ran out of chicken dinners before we were served and had to choose the Veal. In row 3 I thought we would have been first up but ended up being served last. We chose central aisle seats and loved the freedom they provided. Huge thanks to flight attendants for great service. Stansted to LV went smoothly and our flight even arrived early. Digeplayers worked great food was fine service fine and loved the lounge at Stansted. We shared it with the New York flight and it didn't seem to be overcrowded. Free newspapers snack buffet drinks internet stations were all appreciated. Both my husband and I are in our mid 40's enjoyed our journey with MaxJet. A couple of things I would consider when we book with them again is to not book connecting flights within 24 hours of our arrival in London. We lost our connecting flights (non-refundable) and I'm waiting to see how that works out with MaxJet. The customer service rep promised refunds but I haven't heard back yet. We did purchase trip insurance but we'll see how that works out as well. We had to rebook our connecting flight at more than double the original cost to us. I also wish that Las Vegas had a lounge. If the California flights have a lounge we would probably opt to book via California. Express security is wonderful! I think MaxJet is worth flying a good product at a great price. Just be sure that you can be a bit flexible if the plane is delayed.

LAS-STN return. Missed having a lounge in Vegas but ground staff helpful with pre-boarding with 4 kids. Outbound flight delayed for over 3 hours but crew did a good job of keeping everyone informed and the pilots explained the technicalities. The flight was great cabin crew attentive and food excellent. Baggage delivery took no time at all. Barely made the lounge on the return but it looked great. We usually fly Virgin Upper and I think cabin crew service is pretty close entertainment and food is on par and seats are like an improvement on Premium Economy. The entertainment kept us and 3 kids entertained so there was a good mix of programmes available. I would recommend them and look forward to them flying from San Francisco.

STN-IAD return. Great prices and a great service. Every airline sometimes has problems with delays or luggage (just read the reviews on this site to find that out). MaxJet do a fantastic job and given the price you pay it would be crazy to complain! The food is fine the seats comfortable entertainment fine (turn your dinner tray sideways and it all fits by the way!) and service fantastic. Flying from London Stansted is much easier than Heathrow or Gatwick.

### Jet Airways customer review
I can't comment on the flight because I never made it. Cancelled my ticket after 5 calls to customer service to change my departure date. They could not give me a quote to change it immediately and never returned my calls after promising every time. Customer service reps on the phone were awful lacking customer care training kept me waiting forever and failed to even apologize for the situation until the 5th call. Then they wanted to charge me nearly $1000 to change my departure date. They were an absolute nightmare and I finally decided to cancel the ticket and rebook with another airline. It was cheaper to do so and I wanted to cut my losses with this company while I still could. Really Maxjet get your act together.

### Jet Airways customer review
Stansted-JFK. We arrived at Stansted at 8am and were told that Maxjet do not open until 8.45am (their website states 7am). We checked in at 8.45am and with security questions etc the process still only took 5 minutes. Fast Track security a boon and we were in the lounge just after 9am. The lounge was lovely - unlimited good quality sandwiches snacks and drinks. The staff were informative and helpful. The downside was that as our flight left nearly 2 hours late by 11am people were arriving for the Las Vegas flight and it became unbearably crowded. Some people did complain about lack of showers and the toilets were located outside the lounge. The flight itself was more of a mixed bag. We were in seats 9A/9B - more than enough legroom and comfortable seats. We were told that due to the late running of the aircraft canapes would not be served - however seats D to K were offered canapes and people in A/B were not. We had ordered a vegetarian meal but were informed by one of the flight attendants they did not have this - but that the fish was very nice! Not having much choice we accepted it and this was served before other passengers. After everyone had been given their main courses we were presented with a vegetarian main dish by another member of the crew. The help yourself larder - containing a sandwich crisps chocolates and fresh fruit - you had to ask a flight attendant for anything you wanted. About an hour before landing afternoon tea was served. We made up a lot of time and actually arrived pretty much on time at 2.30pm. Considering we paid a few pence less than £599 each return I think we received excellent value for money. It was cheaper than Virgin Atlantic economy and service was better than premium economy and world traveller plus. AI would think twice before paying thousands to travel in upper class or business class with another airline. I hope MaxJet can sort out the tiny niggles because they could so easily be put right.

Tried to travel to DC for business on 25th June and received an email at 09.00 before the 15.00 flight that the aircraft had been downgraded but when I phoned through to take a re-routing option through after receiving the email was told that the limited options had gone but I could have a refund or fly another day. Customer service was appalling. Beware if you are a business passenger and have meetings to attend you can NOT rely on Maxjet to get you there and the customer services could not care. Gave up on the return flight yesterday.

I wish I had discovered this forum before booking with Maxjet then I might not have had such high expectations on my first business class flight to NY. We were booked on their flight to JFK on Friday 15th June (so that was probably our plane which was still on the tarmac - see previous comments). At check-in we were advised there would be a delay as a replacement plane had to be flown in from LAS as there was a problem with ours and as would seem to be the norm we were sent off to the Radisson for breakfast. After a couple more 'time changes' plus some considerable period sitting on the plane whilst supposedly waiting for a second signature on some paperwork (I'm surprised there wasn't a riot!) we eventually departed 12 hrs late. Trying to give Maxjet the benefit of the doubt - these things happen and the plane has to be safe etc. after all - I hoped they would redeem themselves on return journey. Unfortunately that wasn't to be the case. Again we encountered a 3 hr delay this time sitting on the runway whilst air traffic control found us a 'slot'. As has been said previously you do get the feeling of being fobbed-off with what seem feeble excuses but I do feel sorry for the crew who really do try their best and I have to agree that the inflight service etc. is very good. Unfortunately however this is vastly overshadowed by their unreliability. We were not offered any compensation at all but having now read other comments I can probably understand this as it would appear they'd have to compensate almost every passenger. I'm afraid I have to agree with a previous comment that if they don't get their act together pretty quickly they're not going to survive. Word seems to be spreading.

Booked with MaxJet STN-IAD last Nov. for July 24 as the airport is so close. Cancelled Tuesdays' flights way back but didn't tell me till about March so had to change some holiday reservations. Since then I have been keeping a close eye on things. The recent flush of IAD cancellations has meant that I have got my money back and taken the BA Club offer instead before it's too late. I phoned first and was told "in the event of our flight being cancelled next month they would only offer another date or refund". Like other comments here it's a pity not to support them both for the competition they could give and for the convenience of not using LHR but if you can't trust them to fly it's not going anywhere.

I was scheduled to fly STN-LAS on Saturday 16th June. Arriving from Belfast the night before I noticed a Maxjet still on the ground. On enquiring at their desk was told it was the delayed NY and that it was to fly LAS the next morning - when leaving STN at 23.00! Simple flying maths told me that we must be 7 or 8 hours late. The desk girl said she could not say! Website said flight was on time as it still said on Saturday. Yes the flight was over 8 hours delayed - pax were put up in Radisson SAS for day and allowed £15 for meals. When the NY flight landed that evening the waiting pax cheered in the Maxjet lounge. One surprise was being told by the Captain that we were going via Iceland to refuel - the LR a/c was presumably u/s but we were never told this. Arrival in Vegas was 12.30am and then find a taxi! The stay there was enlivened by trying to find out if the flights were back on time - website page eventually taken down and call centre only - staff there knew of no problems!! Flight back was on time almost. Service was OK seats as expected and price good. Is it sensible to fly an airline with 3 tired aircraft? Maybe.

Maxjet makes it hard to love them. They just canceled tomorrow's Stansted to DC flight which was sold out. They have booked us Upper Class on a Virgin flight (and offered a full refund or change of date) but we were trying to avoid the inconvenience of Heathrow as we live in Cambridge. They cancelled the one other time we tried them - when they cancelled the DC route for the whole winter! I wonder if we will be flying Maxjet back on Monday or Virgin! If they can't get their planes to be more dependable Maxjet won't survive - and shouldn't.

### Jet Airways customer review
STN-LAS-STN. We are Premium Economy upgraders rather than business travellers so our experience of high quality air travel is limited. However thanks to correspondents on this forum we thought we knew what the Maxjet experience would be like. Correct. Stansted is great Fast- Track excellent and the dedicated lounge high quality. OK the planes are a bit old but for us the outward journey was heaven: masses of legroom; attentive friendly high-calibre service; good food and entertainment; and clean toilets. In fact it was close to perfect. We have travelled to Vegas often and never arrived as sprightly and rested as this. To compare it with Virgin Premium Economy is farcical. It was superb. Unfortunately here comes the sting. After booking our flights in February (in the sale at £600 return) we monitored the flights on Maxjet's website to check reliability. Every flight (yes we should get out more). It was excellent for a couple of months but nearing our departure date things started to slip. This coincided with the reinstatement of the Washington service. We are not experts and have no knowledge of the airline business but it seems that Maxjet have barely enough planes to go round. While the Washington route was suspended things were fine now they are flying by the seat of their pants (apologies). Our return plane from Vegas arrived from London 2 hours late. We were told because of a combination of 'abnormal heat in Vegas a full load and a shorter runway because of prevailing winds' we would have to stop in JFK to refuel as we couldn't take off with a full fuel load. 38 degrees in Vegas abnormal? They've not been there often in August then. Total rubbish. We don't know what the problem was - perhaps they borrowed the plane from the Washington route (see comment below from T Williams) and it didn't have as large a fuel tank. Or perhaps it leaked?! Who knows? But it wasn't because it was hot in Vegas. We arrived at Stansted 6 hours late. I personally felt pretty ill when we had to land an hour after going to sleep and then had to sit on the tarmac for an hour. Worse than travelling Economy - possibly. We can't fault the staff (although no apology was ever given for our late arrival) and every other part of the experience was very good. We would go to Vegas again with Maxjet at sale prices as there are limited alternatives. But New York - there would appear to be better choices at similar prices. Do not rely on this airline (certainly while they try to cover too many routes with not enough planes). Just know what you are getting into. If you have two trouble free flights then you'll have a great trip and a bargain to boot.

Dulles to STN on June 4 - original aircraft was in for servicing so they replaced our plane with an "all first class" 757 previously leased to the Dallas Mavericks basketball team. Seats were above coach but certainly far from first class. Cabin crew were very apologetic and still fed us very good food but a single aisle plane with seats that hardly recline didn't make it up for us. On the taxi trip to STN for our June 17 return we learned through the toll-free celll number that the flight would be delayed 7 1/2 hours. Phone agent would not rebook us - said we had to take care of it after arriving at the STN counter. When we got to the counter we found out the flight had been cancelled. We were put on a shuttle back to Heathrow where we were rebooked in COACH on Virgin! As consolation we were told that we would each receive two vouchers for future travel on Maxjet. We'll see if the vouchers actually show up and if the airline stays in business - otherwise I wouldn't fly these guys unless I had a whole lot of time on either side of the trip to allow for 24 hours of schedule mishaps. Also that it was interesting that of the seven flights operating this week from Dulles to Stansted 2 were delayed 7 hours 2 were delayed over 12 hours and 2 more were completely cancelled.

### Jet Airways customer review
JFK-STN-JFK last week. The plane was full on NY-London run and almost full on the return. Service remains equal if not superior to United/American Intl. business class. The experience can be described as what MaxJet calls traditional business class. This means a comfortable seat with a 60" pitch (not a flat bed) decent food (the lobster was probably the best in flight meal I have had) alcoholic beverages served by attentive cabin crew and a decent selection of movies. There were some minor issues I would have liked to see improved such as serving dinner sooner and breakfast later and heating up the nuts before serving them (a real time inflight tracker would also be nice as would power ports) but these are minor quibbles. A note to those who would avoid MaxJet because they would rather use or accrue frequent flyer miles on a major carrier: Fly MaxJet instead. I have priced out a business class upgrade on this route on two US carriers and it was the same price before accounting for the 50000-60000 miles I would then need to expend before getting the upgrade. I prefer to save my major carrier miles for when I really need them or they are a better use of miles such as for trips to Asia.

So inadequate were Maxjet's replies to my two e-mails on disrupted seating assignments that I have written to their Customer Services VP an address provided in their onboard literature. Maxjet are offering a dood fare good seat and pretty good food but let themselves down badly on reliability timekeeping and customer service. The comment on the good seat does not apply to 8D/F which they should not be selling as their regular product. My battles on changed seat assignments continued at LAS. It appears that the Reservations department do not fully understand the impact of aircraft changes some of which occur because of Maxjet's flaky reliability. The inbound aircraft was late but still had time to go out on time at 5pm. However they were always chasing the clock when the cabin crew were boarded late perhaps because of the TSA. We didn't push back until 5.15 and then had a 20min taxi. One thing that goes straight out of the window with time constraints is the canape service which I have not seen in a while. I imagine they are loaded so am I to understand that they are simply wasted? Maxjet show an overall time of 10hrs LAS-STN which I think is actually unachievable given the time factors at LAS and flight on two engines. The pilot made a bizarre departure announcement that the forecast weather for London was 54 degrees (F) and must have been reading an actual rather than a forecast. My lobster was unexpected and very good but it would have taken more than an agreeable crustacean to improve my overall impression of Maxjet on my 4th round trip. I can report a highly satisfactory outcome to my latest tranche of queries which eventualy I addressed to VPCS at Maxjet. I received comprehensive and valid responses; given the benefits offered by Maxjet in spite of their occasional failings I shall be happy to travel with them again.

I just travelled with Maxjet to Las Vegas. Service was excellent for the price. The Business class cannot be compared with the likes of BA or Virgin but the price is comparable with Premium Economy. The seat is equivelent to the old style bucket seats. The seat goes back far enough to get a decent night sleep and the configuration is 2-2-2. As for the price I compared their price with Virgin and BMI's Premium economy price. And at just under £800.00 including tax it was a no brainer! I got a further discount from invegas.co.uk. The flight takes a bit longer than Virgin but this is probably due to the smaller plane. If you are a regular business class traveller and you think you are saving a fortune you will be disapointed. If however you fancy splashing out instead of economy then you will be delighted!

MaxJet is an economy airline maquerading as a 'quality' alternative to BA/AA/Virgin/United business class - the Ryan Air of 'business class'. The planes are very old and tired - which means they have an unusually high percentage of mechanical problems. I was diverted to Boston enroute from Dulles to Stanstead when one of the two generators onboard (which powers the entire aircraft electrical system) failed over Newfoundland. The staff were ill prepared for any of the obvious fallout such as "what the ---- do we do now to get to London". I opted to take my money back from MaxJet rent a car back to DC and booked a very comfortable Virgin Economy Plus seat the following evening.

I paid £999.00 each for my wife and myself to fly MAXjet from London Stanstead to Washington Dulles return. The outward flight from London was excellent. Check in VIP lounge cabin services etc were all of a high standard After a very enjoyable but tiring holiday we checked in at Dulles for our flight to Stansted only to be informed that our aircraft for the flight had been changed to a Boeing 737 and that no business class accommodation was now available. Half of the aircraft was economy class and the rest I would classify as an upgrade. We spent over an hour at the check in desk having arrived there at 19.00hrs owing to in my opinion inexperienced check in staff who were incapable of handling the situation. The security personnel sent us back to the check in desk no less than on three occasions firstly because they had not given us any boarding passes and then they had entered the wrong information or no information at all. Our problems did not end there . When we did eventually board the aircraft we remained seated for well nigh three hours before we finally took off at 0.29hrs. During this entire period we were not offered any hospitality and it was only after I had mentioned this to one of the cabin staff that cold water and a small bowl of mixed nuts were offered to the passengers and to add insult to injury the nuts were more or less immediately taken back on the grounds that take off was imminent although we still remained on the ground for another 30 odd minutes. I appreciate and understand that there was a logistical problem that was taxing some of the crew but this still does not detract from the fact that this level of service was a shamble. Where was the welcoming glass of champagne? Dinner was finally served at around 1.30am quite an unsociable hour. The seats were so restricted in their lateral movement so much so that my wife and myself both in our 70's spent a very uncomfortable night. We finally landed at Stansted at 12.30pm. Having paid £999.00 for each person I consider the offer of $500each person in vouchers to fly MAXjet valid for one year as totally inadequate.

This is not an airline an international passenger would want to connect to for they have a limit of one bag (33lbs US). We were on an international flight so we each had two bags. We kept them at 33 lbs for we knew the weight limit beforehand but did not find anywhere on their website that the limit was 1 bag each. We were charged extra. I will say that the gate agent in Rome took pity on us nad only charged us 30 euro instead of the 80 required. After some discussion in Palermo the agent relented and only charged us 30 euro back to Rome. Other airlines flying to Palermo may not charge for extra baggage so check them out first if you have more than one bag. Windjet flew A319 (similar to Southwest Airlines). Very comfortable left on time personnel was friendly. Other than bag restriction I would fly Windjet again. Price of ticket was very good.

Las Vegas to Stansted. On time efficient baggage handling staff helpful and good humoured. Turbulence meant the service carts had to stay secured so dinner was individually served and the staff kept smiling. the old business-class seats are not the most comfortable for a 10 + hour flight and the movies could be a little more edgy but for that price.

Stansted to JFK route twice in the last month and overall very happy with service and value. Stansted was great - fast check in fast track through security super lounge easy boarding. Service onboard was good if a little less attentive than most business class services - you had to ask for stuff instead of being constantly asked if you wanted more wine which is the norm in business class. The plane is old and cosmetically tired but what do you expect for £350. The lack of guaranteed connections and inability to check baggage onto connecting flights is worth accepting to get tickets this cheaply especially given the 30 min check in deadline. Korean Air Lounge at JFK was OK but they could do a better job of keeping the drinks stocked up. The free arrivals service at Stansted Radisson more than makes up for it. I am finding these newer airlines a breath of fresh air after years of Delta misery and look forward to seeing their network expanding further. Maxjet is keen to please and see their business expand through positive word of mouth. That is certainly happening - my only worry is that they'll use the higher load factors as an excuse to crank the prices up!

LAS-STN-LAS. Seats comfortable service was good. Both flights on time fast track through security wonderful. I think Maxjet gives good value for the money will use them again - hoping they eventually having flights leaving from the Los Angeles area!

STN-LAS-STN. Outbound - fast track through security worked perfectly lounge is good although crawling around the floor and lifting dusty carpet flaps for laptop power isn't really on! Flight was almost full and seemed to take ages to get everyone on board so pre flight drinks were served 30 mins into flight. Seats comfy enough although they are already showing signs of age plenty of room. Service was amateurish the crew seemed disorganized and I was trapped behind a tray table for over an hour watching the keystone cops handing out cold bread rolls. Rest of the flight was fine digiplayer was good and good selection of movies seat was great and even managed to grab a few hours sleep. Terminal 2 at LAS really is a dump! Inbound - No lounge this time and waiting for a business class flight in a bus shelter isn't on. Flight left late (again) but got a drink while we were on the ground this time as a sign of the service to come we managed to take off with several passengers still with champagne glasses on seats and in hand (a few rolled down the aisle). Service looked abysmal again (this seems to be a feature) not sure how they manage this with just 96 of us! I opted for minimal food and got out from under a tray table after just 20 mins decided to sleep for as long as possible large 80's style seats were great for a snooze resulting in 6 hrs shuteye! Toilets are grotty and worth avoiding if at all possible. Breakfast was a weird mixed grill wrap? which was luke warm managed to hang onto digiplayer until 40 mins from landing much to the annoyance of cabin crew. We landed 1 hr late no apology or even reason just late! Overall Maxjet need to change either quit pushing "all business class" and call it "huge seat at a low price" or sort out the service and cut passengers some slack to sleep or watch TV when they like! I'll fly again but I know what to expect now so a packed lunch and sleep all the way!

JFK-STN-JFK. On time both ways. Seats comfortable although passengers frequently needed assistance to return seats upright. Snacks and beverages great. Food good but did not meet expectations. DigEplayers fantastic and mine was collected 30 min before landing. Bathrooms needed attention. Service very attentive. Korean Air lounge at JFK great. Stansted lounge okay. Check-in both ways a breeze. Aircraft was clean except for bathrooms. I was treated like a first class passenger. Connecting at JFK was a hassle but worth it to fly Maxjet.

Observation on Andres Mesa's comment "Before reaching the check-in counter passengers are first screened in the queue asking the same security questions at the check-in counter [same process not adopted with BA/Silverjet etc]. This is because BA and Silverjet are not American Carriers. Maxjet being an American carrier are bound by the TSA to conduct such checks before checkin in a foreign country. The person doing the checks actually has a laptop computer which they download TSA info to and then scan your passport then and there! It is entirely separate from the check in process. As someone who has done it twice yes it's a bore but it is not down to the airline's incompetence!

Maxjet to and from Las Vegas in march this year and found the flights excellent. Space great service very good and the food outward bound super but not so good inbound - lack of choice and they should not run out of options with only 79 to feed! Lounge at stansted and fast track great - we wait for the lounge at Vegas! Al in all well done and we will use maxjet again

STN-LAS-STN. 50% outbound and 97% return full flight. Uneventful and smooth check-in both ways - disappointed that no lounge facility in Vegas. Very enjoyable outbound flight - attentive inflight service though the food quality and quantity is a big let-down. Comfortable seat for the price. Inflight entertainment via DigEplayers. Unsure why it needed to be collected 1.5 hours before landing - seem to be the policy as occurs on both directions. Surely 1/2 hour prior to is sufficient. Las Vegas to London flight on time but inflight service is less than attractive. Some cabin crews appeared to be less experienced. Food ran out rather fast on the dinner service with bread roll served cold. Being an overnight flight it would be logical to dim the cabin lights and lower the shades after dinner serving - none had been acted upon. If you miss out of the initial breakfast serving 2 hours before landing be prepared to starve until arrival - very unimaginative. With a near full flight good refill of toiletries is essential - not so on this flight. I would be rather reluctant to try out the Washington and New York service if maximise sleep is top of the list - re shades and cabin lights. Given the price paid I would fly them again.

STN-LAS-STN. Slow check-in resulted from repetitive process. Before reaching the check-in counter passengers are first screened in the queue asking the same security questions at the check-in counter [same process not adopted with BA/Silverjet etc]. Superb in-flight service although food quality and quantity were a bit disappointing. 2 choices of hot entrees lamb and beef - whatever happened to fish for vegetarians? Lamb without any sauce wasn't very tasty. Seats 1980 biz class but comfortable enough. DigEplayers good - flights on time. Toilet very old and not very clean. Overallvalue for money. One disappointment that crew show little interest in restocking toiletries.

Stansted to Las Vegas return. Check-in for both flights excellent. At Stansted fast-tracked through security with no problems. Maxjet lounge at Stansted was great plenty to eat drink and read. The cabin crew on both flights were excellent very friendly nothing too much trouble. The seats were very comfortable food and drinks excellent. Personal media-player is a nice touch and comes pre-loaded with latest films videos TV shows and a good selection of music.

STN-LAS-STN Very enjoyable trip on both flights. Seats comfortable allowing me to sleep for 6 hours on the return. Food nice wines werein plentiful supply. DigEplayers excellent with a wide selection of . Check-in quick at both ends fastrack at Stansted brilliant lounge very nice. Las Vegas less good without the lounge. Both flights on time. I was highly impressed with product and pleased on a value for money basis.

STN-JFK. Swift check-in at Stansted followed by fast track through security. Lounge at Stansted comfortable and located next to gate. Flight departed on time. Although the seats may be from a bygone era of international business class travel they are more than adequate to work or doze off. FA's extremely polite serving food and drink that is better than I've experienced in BA's club world. Personal tv is perfect and comes pre-loaded with latest films etc. Return leg just as good with exception of crowded Korean Airlines lounge at JFK and the annoying blast of music 2 hours before landing that wakes everyone for breakfast. A far more satisfying experience than the similarly priced premium economy cabins of BA or Virgin.

Stansted to Las Vegas return. Check-in for both flights were excellent. At Stansted we were fast-tracked through security with no problem. The Maxjet lounge at Stansted was superb but unfortunately Maxjet don't have a lounge in Las Vegas. The cabin crew on the outbound flight were a dream nothing was too much trouble and service was second to none. Although the service was still excellent on our return flight some of the crew could have been a little more friendly. The seats were very good food and drinks excellent flights were on time and we could highly recommend Maxjet.

Good Service Verona VRN - Moscow DME. 30 minutes delay saved lots of money compared to economy ticket on regular carrier and did not have to change flights in Vienna. Fruit Juice or soft drinks and modest meal included. Boarding passes issued with seat so there is not the mad rush for seats as with Ryan air. Airbus is old makes some noise but did not fall out of the sky.

SYD- MEL. My husband and I were truly impressed on our first flight with Ozjet. The entire journey was a pleasure. Couldn't fault anything at all. Fine food and great service. The cabin crew were immaculate and extremely professional and attentive. It's an airline that will surely soon be leading the way for the astute business person. I think the media should be heralding a wonderful breakthrough for the Australian traveller. We shall certainly travel with Ozjet again. Hope they soon expand their routes to other states.

SYD-MEL-SYD. It's hard to fault their in-flight service. 60 seats all business-class. Their pre and after-sales services needs refining. Having already had a schedule change notification a few days before the SYD-MEL leg I was annoyed and frustrated to wake up on the morning of the flight driving from Canberra to Sydney to get another message they had left very late the night before telling me that the 9am flight had been cancelled - and I'd been put on the 8am flight instead. That might have been fine if I'd lived in Sydney but it made the drive up to Sydney from Canberra fast and furious! I tried many times to contact OzJet's customer service line after their 6am opening but couldn't - it took them to call me at 6:45am before they realised their incoming call line had not been activated for the morning! When I arrived in Sydney I had to use valet parking ($139) in order to make my flight. Before the return leg I logged on to check the flight details only to find the MEL-SYD portion had mysteriously disappeared from my online itinerary. After ringing them I was told that it had been a mistake; they had deleted that portion instead of the cancelled flight a few days earlier! I was put back on the flight but really business won't wear this sort of inconvenience.

MEL-SYD return. 737-200 both ways. Clean aircraft. Nice big seats. Meals good and full bar service. Cabin staff very friendly and always around - but they only had about 20 people to look after as the plane was mostly empty. I would fly OZJet again.

### Jet Airways customer review
MEL-SYD. The jet was immaculate as was the cabin crew. The seats were huge - same as traditional business class seats and leg room was more than generous. We received a glass of champagne and a choice of other drinks. A full meal was provided - great quality. The cabin crew were attentive and nothing was too much trouble. There were only 12 people on the flight which was a bizarre experience - we got a really good deal on the flight and I'm shocked that more people aren't trying it. It made flying fun and enjoyable again it really did.
