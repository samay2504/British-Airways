### "Very unorganized"
Not Verified |  Plane holds 17 people. They overbooked the flight and 4peices of luggage made it on the aircraft. The plane was an hour late. Half of the passengers had a 1:00pm international connecting flight to the USA. The plane touched down at 12:20pm. Noone got there luggage. Very unorganized but it's the only access to little Cayman.

### "I was refused to board early"
Worst service I’ve ever received upon check-in. I am handicapped but do not need a wheelchair. I carry my disability placard and always purchase best seat class available for airlines. I just need extra time getting settled into aircraft and I was refused to board early since I didn’t get a wheel chair. I had to wait for several families with children to board first since I was told children are a priority over disabled passengers without wheelchairs. This airline will only recognize disabled passengers if you are in a wheelchair which is ridiculous. I can spend my money on another airline that will respect disabled and elderly passengers that need extra help in the future. I was looking forward to trying this airline. This is definitely a one and done. I will never fly on this discriminatory airline again.

### "do not recommend traveling with Cayman Airways"
I do not recommend traveling with Cayman Airways. If possible, avoid it, especially if it is to travel to Cuba. I traveled round trip Miami - Havana with a stopover in Grand Cayman. On the way back, the flight from Havana was delayed a few minutes and when we arrived in Grand Cayman, the plane that was supposed to take us to Miami was leaving. When claiming, both the immigration agent and the airline representatives told us that this is a common occurrence. The immigration agent laughed as the plane left. He got upset and treated me badly because I said that it wasn't funny, that we had to work the next day, and that we had paid including the connecting flight. We found it very irresponsible that they did not make sure to wait for the missing passengers, even more so knowing that the flight was almost arriving. The worst thing is that, as I said before, this situation is frequent, and that the immigration agent did not show any empathy, it was very I'm unpleasant. No recomiendo viajar con Cayman Airways. Si es posible, evitenla, especialmente si es para viajar a Cuba. Viajé ida y vuelta Miami - Habana con escala en Gran Cayman. Al regreso el vuelo de la Habana se atrasó unos minutos y al llegar a Gran Cayman el avión que debía llevarnos a Miami estaba saliendo. Al reclamar, tanto el agente de inmigración como los representantes de la aerolínea nos dijeron que eso es común que ocurra. El agente de inmigración se rió al ver que el avión se fue. Se molestó y me trató mal al decirle que eso no era gracioso, que teníamos que trabajar al siguiente día, y que habíamos pagado incluyendo el vuelo de conexión. Nos pareció muy irresponsable que no se aseguraran de esperar a los pasajeros que faltaban, aún más sabiendo que ya el vuelo estaba al llegar. Lo peor es que, como ya dije antes, esa situación es frecuente, y que el agente de inmigración no mostró ninguna empatía, fue muy desagradable

### "the delays are long"
New York JFK to Grand Cayman. Don't even think about flying Cayman Airways until the Max 8 are back in the air. They are currently flying a schedule that they can't possibly make and the delays are long! No TV's or WIFI available.

### "worst flying experience"
New York to Grand Cayman. When we flew into this country, we had a wonderful experience. Flying back however, was the worst flying experience I’ve ever seen. We were met at the check in counter by the rudest woman I have ever met in my life. She not only rolled her eyes about a dozen times, charged us the incorrect amount for bags and told us it was our fault, and cussed under her breathe about 4 times during our interaction, and she decided to take a personal cell phone call while checking us in (she walked away from us on the phone), and there were about 25 people behind us in line. We then went through customs where they proceeded to tell us there were totally different flight regulations for our carry on. The rude woman told me to take all liquids out, and put them in a little bag she gave me. She then informed me that this included my lipstick (since when is lipstick and liquid?). So as I’m emptying out my whole purse she starts hysterically laughing that I have “so many more liquids in the carryon”. We wound up having to go all the way back to happy pants at check in and check our carryon. Then, I return with no liquids, to find out that my brother, his girlfriend, and my fiancé have all been stopped too for a “random check”. I have never had an experience with an airline that is less competent, kind, or respectful in my life. I would take ten connecting flights before flying this airline ever again.

### "Staff were very unprofessional"
We were on a 7:50 am flight to go to Miami with quick stop in Grand Cayman. We had a day of lies (need a part, sending extra planes, you’re on the next flight, etc). It took 14 hours to board our flight then another 30+ minute wait because of ‘incorrect paperwork’. 30 minute flight then another 90+ minute wait at other end for information and vouchers. Staff were very unprofessional. One check in person even came outside to argue with the lady Running the taxi stand. Everyone missed connecting flights, incurring hundreds of dollars in extra fees or booking last minute. No apologies from anyone with the airline. What a bad way to end a fabulous diving vacation. Took almost another whole day to get home.

### "Don't fly Cayman Airways"
Not Verified |  Don't fly Cayman Airways. 12 hour delay, communicated to us every few hours, because the flight crew had to rest. Been in the airport 12 hours now, with no reliable take-off time, and no offer of compensation for a full day missed of vacation. The customer service is atrocious! Upon further research I have learned that this is a normal course of business for this airline. They do not honor their flight times, and fly upon the crews whims. Save yourself the aggravation and fly JetBlue instead! !

### "the worst airline experience"
Grand Cayman to New York. I fly more than most most people, typically 6-8 a months between work and personal purposes. This airline has by far been the worst airline experience I have had. They kept the cabin lights on through out the duration of the flight and it was an evening flight. The flight attendants did not contain the passengers. Several were highly intoxicated as well loud and obnoxious forwards other passengers. Unreal! The food  served was simply atrocious. The pilot told us the flight time was 3 hours and 13 minutes. Apparently there were no complications, but we still arrived after 4 hour. We sat on standby at the gate for approximately 25 minutes at 11 PM at night! There were basically no flights coming or going from JFK.

### "Worst airline ever!"
Roatan to New York via Grand Cayman. Worst airline ever! Flight delayed for 7 hours, deviated and had to land in North Carolina because it had no fuel, we were stuck inside the aircraft at the airport multiple hours and they didn’t have even water! Worst experience flying ever and I would not recommend this airline to even an enemy. They claimed delay was because of weather but had we left at the scheduled time, the weather was just great and all other scheduled flights were leaving the airport.

### "very disappointed at check in"
Grand Cayman to Miami. We are very disappointed at check in. There is a special lane for business class but no one comes to service us at all. They just let us standing without any attention. If you want to open just one lane, so close the business class lane! We pay extra money for what?

### "was a great experience"
Grand Cayman to Little Cayman return. This was a great experience. Flights were on time. Both pilots were friendly. Seats were small, but adequate. No cabin service, but the flights were 22 and 30 minutes. Really fun! If you're looking for a posh, first class experience, then this isn't for you. But for those looking to go off the beaten trail, you'll really enjoy this.

### "worst airline I've ever flown"
Leaving Grand Cayman the flight was delayed over 3 hours, I'm finding out now that delays are a normal part of doing business for Cayman Airways. I was forced to miss my connecting flight out of Tampa and was forced to pay an additional $1,700 to cover the cost. Cayman Airways would not reimburse the cost. The Gate Agents were confused and did a horrible job communicating anything. I will not fly Cayman Airways again, worst airline I've ever flown!

### "customer service very poor"
Our return from Grand Cayman to Chicago O'Hare departed two hours late. The airline offered only that the jet was two hours late when it left O'Hare. When we finally left Grand Cayman, the cabin was very cold and the crew was not able to turn the heat on. Passengers who asked for a blanket were charged $5.00! I asked a steward about blankets and he said they only had 8 blankets and it would be difficult to have 124 blankets so everyone could have a blanket. Upon arrival at Chicago O'Hare, the pilot encouraged us to fly Cayman Airways again but made no mention or apology for the very uncomfortable cold flight. I understand mechanical problems but the pilot did nothing to explain or apologize for the problem. In my opinion, their customer service was very poor! Some reply from Cayman Airways would be appreciated.

### "delayed by over 4.5 hours"
An airline has a duty to post departure and arrival times correctly, and be on time according to the schedule. During my first and only experience flying with Cayman Airways, they failed to meet these standards, on both the outbound flight and return flight in what one would expect to be a short, easy flight from Tampa to Grand Cayman. Not only were both flights delayed, the first flight delayed by over 4.5 hours, Cayman Airways posted incorrect information including a flight number that wasn't operating that day, and another flight posting the old departure time with the new arrival time, a difference of 3 hours (after calling the airline, the flight was delayed and the departure time was listed incorrectly). I do not live in Tampa. Another, more responsible airline was able to change my travel bookings due to missed connections. I also lost a day of my vacation and a day of work, and had to buy 2 nights in an airport hotel in Tampa. Cabin service is lousy unless you are business/first class. Once onboard and in transit, it is no problem. The failure of scheduling is major when people have hotels, taxis, and connections to coordinate.

### Cayman Airways customer review
Flew from Miami to Havana via the Caymans. 1.5 hrs and 45 min flights. Very nice check-in staff in MIA - helpful. Nice flights in old but well kept 737-300. Cabin crew middle aged smiling and professional on both flights. Lots of Cubans on flight = lots of luggage. Ground staff obviously knows this and it seemed like one baggage-handler was dedicated - onboard! Only to help pax with finding space in hat racks. Transit in Cayman quite a mess though since no info was given from flight/cabin/ground-staff about well anything. You have to enter the country and leave again as if you had stayed there for a week. The whole process took about 1 hour. The little airports departure hall was overcrowded and contained no info-boards at all.

### Cayman Airways customer review
We have been vacationing to the Cayman Islands for years. We love the place. This was the first year we flew Cayman Air from DFW since they started direct flights which we thought was wonderful. Our departure flight was somehow 3 hours late. We arrived almost at 11pm. We had a return flight at 8am. We got up at 5 am to be at the airport on time. Flight was delayed 4.5 hours. Most people with connections missed their flights. Will never fly Cayman Air again.

### Cayman Airways customer review
HAV-GCM-LCE. Flight from Cuba packed flight was delayed they offered free drinks and you don't pay for the checked bag. Seats are ok aircraft ageing and smelly. The crew on the first leg was fine many Cubans on board and only one crew could actually talk in Spanish second leg quite empty crew less friendly and seemed lost. Would fly them again only if the price is right.

### Cayman Airways customer review

### Cayman Airways customer review
First I have to say that the delay at JFK was unacceptable because it could have been accounted for previously. The flight the night before arrived late and the crew needed their rest period and they could have planned this into the schedule because apparently it happens very regularly. The planes were very clean but were showing their wear. The seats seemed kind of loose which was especially bad when an out of control kid behind me was kicking. My seatback moved an inch every time he kicked. One good thing about the old seats is that they really recline. With my feet under the seat in front of me I was almost able to lie straight. They showed the same movie both directions which was a bunch of advertisements for places in the Cayman Islands. I didn't really watch it and it was totally unnecessary on the way back. There were no music channels or anything but who needs them that bad on a four hour flight. I was very happy to find out that there would be full meal service on board which is not something I have seen on such a short flight in a very long time. Our morning flight out included one breakfast option (eggs croissant sausage and other sides) and one lunch option which I chose (turkey wrap fruit salad roll cheese and crackers and cake). I was surprised by the quality of the food. On the way back the choices were beef or chicken. I went for the chicken which had broccoli rice a roll and a strange coconut cookie. Everything was pretty good except the cookie. Some people got a rum cake for their dessert... I wasn't one of them. The flight attendants were friendly enough and they were usually at work. Unlike on domestic flights where they have nothing to do and hide in galley for 6 hours. The airport terminal in Grand Cayman is dilapidated but a new terminal is in the works so it won't be long.

### Cayman Airways customer review
Miami-Grand Cayman-Miami in Economy. The service on Cayman Airways is comparable to a lot of European airlines and probably better than the domestic product offered on short-haul services in the USA. Despite the old aircraft interiors are faultless and you could not ask for much more from the cabin crew

### Cayman Airways customer review
I like Cayman Airways and choose to fly CA when I travel MIA-GCM. However I am disappointed with the Frequent Flyer programme. I found it nigh impossible to check the status of my air miles and even if I had navigated to the site it would not have made any difference as when I tried to recover my password I got the response 'null' - clearly incorrect. I still haven't been able to get a reminder of my password. Help!

### Cayman Airways customer review
Flew Miami to Grand Cayman. Plane spotless and fa's some of the best I have ever encountered. Well done and keep it up

### Cayman Airways customer review
MIA-Grand Cayman return in Business. Check-in at MIA was disorganized. While there were several check-in agents on hand very few were interested in actually checking in passengers. I stood in the business class check-in queue which was a mistake because I was ignored. Finally I joined the Y class queue and was eventually taken care of. General state of check-in was apathy. Standard business class set-up with eight seats up front in the 737-300. Interior was reasonably clean and the small up-front cabin was spacious and comfortable. The flight left on time and arrived in GCM on time which is of primary importance (after safety I suppose). The in flight service was friendly and the "snack" was plentiful (cheese and fruit). Our bags came off the belt almost last as Miami had neglected to place priority baggage tags onto our suitcases (not the case leaving GCM so that our bags were first coming off the belt in Miami upon our return a few days later). Overall a reasonably priced business class ticket (very reasonable when compared to their only competitor on this route American Airlines). Service was good overall (better than American).

### Cayman Airways customer review
I flew earlier in the day from Vancouver to Miami via Houston with Continental Airlines on my way to the Cayman Islands. The service and overall experience with Cayman Airways as compared to Continental was night and day. Cayman Airways uses 25 year old 737-200's but you'd think they just rolled off of the assembly line. Sparkling clean great colour scheme tons of leg room and seat pitch and great on-board service. I got more food and beverages on the 75 minute flight from Miami to Grand Cayman than I did on the 4.5 hour flight earlier in the day from Vancouver to Houston with Continental. Cayman had an awesome cabin crew and a very friendly pilot that personally thanked and shook hands with every passenger as we de-planed. I have nothing but positive things to say about Cayman Airways! !
