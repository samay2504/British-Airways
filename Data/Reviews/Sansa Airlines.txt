### "worst airline I've ever flown"
This is the worst airline I've ever flown. 2 out of 3 booked trips were cancelled at their fault. Humorously, on the day that they tried to get me and another cancelled passenger on the next flight, their pilots decided to fly 2/3 of the route, stopping over in Tamarindo (before my destination Nosara), and then without any consultation with several of us on the plane who would have happily got off there and taken a cab, forgot to check the sunset time and flew us back to San Jose. Thereafter their San Jose ground staff debated for an hour that they had fulfilled the conditions of carriage (LOL) and staunchly refused to compensate with a hotel room or replacement flight for marooning us in San Jose (and losing my regional booking), and then when they finally conceded, they put myself and another passenger who I had just met in the same hotel room. Of course I fought this nonsense, too. Hard to imagine a meaner or more immature form of conduct. In another case, trying to get a flight back to San Jose after my trip in Nosara a few weeks later, they cancelled a flight with under 10 minutes notice, and thus myself and a handful of others lost follow-on bookings, including two unfortunate French teenagers who lost their $2000+ flights back to Europe. They have now taken almost 1.5 months inventing conditions to give me a refund, which cost me another 500-1000 EUR in forward bookings lost Their leadership is incredibly uncaring, unaccountable and lazy. Pay ~15-20% extra to fly with Costa Rica Green Airways and give this awful airline no business. They are disgraceful.

### “They provided no solution”
Sansa cancelled the flight 40 mins after the departure time, they said it was due to the weather conditions. They provided no solution to get me back to San José in order to join a group of 21 friends for a diving trip to Isla del Coco (I simply could not miss the boat for the 36 hour crossing). Sansa refused a $ refund. They applied their WIN (Sansa) - LOSE (customer) policy by only offering a credit voucher valid for a mere 6 months (knowing full well that this is no good for tourists).

### “offered no partial refund for inconvenience”
Yesterday, 1 day before my flight, Sansa emailed me to say that had moved time of today’s flight from 1pm to 8h10am! (I would have preferred to take a leisurely breakfast by the pool!). I emailed them for an explanation but got no response. The flight actually left early and arrived 1 minute before the scheduled departure time. Of course they offered no partial refund for the inconvenience caused yet if you want to change the date/time of your flight they will charge you for it. Or if they cancel a flight they keep all your money and only offer a credit voucher valid for a mere 6 months.

### "would highly recommend"
We flew from Liberia to San Jose. This was an incredibly easy flight! We left exactly in time and arrived a few minutes early in San Jose. The San Jose Domestic terminal is a very easy and quick experience. Absolutely no problems whatsoever. I would highly recommend.

### "Avoid this airline"
Not Verified |  Quepos to San Jose. Well, my family and I were suppose to fly with Sansa, but after waiting at the airport for a while we were told the flight was cancelled and there were no other flights for us. The counter person said we would be refunded our ticket price. However, when I inquired with the airline several days later I was simply told that they do not give refunds, even when they cancel a flight. Avoid this airline.

### "Refuses to refund me"
Refuses to refund me, do not trust this airline. Sansa was supposed to refund me for a canceled flight almost 2 months ago. I still have not received the refund. I email and no one responds. No one can explain to me why I haven't received a refund yet. It does not take this long to return me half of the money I paid for. Please avoid this airline at all cost. They are not worth it. There are other ways of getting around Costa Rica to which you can avoid this airline

### "I would recommend them"
Tambor to San José. Regional airline. Flight with Cessna 208, clean and flight was on time. Very basic airport but the staff were eager to operate it efficient. They operate from  San José domestic terminal which is basic but does the job. They are trustworthy and I would recommend them.
