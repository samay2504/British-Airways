### "arrived 32 mins late"
Air Dolomiti did not perform. Supposed to be off the ground at 10:10am and did not take off till 11:00am and arrived 32 mins late. Missed connection in Frankfurt and spent 9 hours waiting in airport to get home on a rebooked flight.

### “I sent incessant emails for 2 months”
Let’s start off by saying I paid 2000€ for a one way economy class ticket from Italy to South Africa with 2 layovers. Delayed connecting flights however resulted in me arriving 12 hours after the initial arrival time, WITHOUT my suitcases, after being re issued tickets for different flights. Upon doing some research about compensation illegibility I decided to get in touch. I sent incessant emails for 2 months and after no reply, hope dwindled. I finally received a reply after my last mail turned nasty. Thereafter, each email started by apologizing for the delay because the waiting time for a response was laughable. 3 Months later and I have still not received a cent… I have likely given up by now, which means they have won, and this was likely their intended outcome from the start.

### "the flights are not bad"
Over the past 2 years, I have flown at least 10 times for work. My husband also frequently travels via this route, separate from me, for his job. We assume that this flight will be late, and plan accordingly. We have both had horrible experiences with missed connections, as Lufthansa/Air Dolomiti cannot provide proper customer service (for hotel, re-imbursements, etc) at Munich or Frankfurt airports. I should have known better. In March 2023, 2 bags were checked in Toronto. I tracked both bags via the Air Canada app until Frankfurt, so I know that both arrived. Of course, connection in Frankfurt was three hours late. Once I did arrive in Turin, one of the bags was missing. There were three other people in line that day with missing bags. 4 days later my bag was delivered to my home. Suitcase was damaged, the lock broken off, and items missing! I will now be avoiding Lufthansa + Air Dolomiti as there are more reliable options. Customer service center rep in Albania was extremely kind and reassuring. Italian counter-parts, not so much. In all fairness, the flights are not bad with clean aircraft, free water, and pleasant/multilingual airline attendants.

### “not a single flight on time”
Not Verified |  I flew multiple times with them, not a single flight on time. The company is the only connection from minor airports of Italy to Lufthansa Flights, so there is no alternative, but Lufthansa should be ashamed of collaborating with them.

### "A to B and that's all"
Not Verified |  A to B and that's all. I was pleased to see that the Embraer aircraft on this route was not as noisy as I remembered from years ago. The senior crew were grumpy and avoided eye contact or any interaction with passengers.

### "no time to transfer my luggage"
Lufthansa Frequent Flyer here. You will see a previous review from me entitled "Seems to be late quite a lot", under the surname Weber. Good news: Air Dolomiti (owner: Lufthansa) is still late on my travels. This time, it was only 30 minutes! They are improving. Excuse: "We left Frankfurt late". The problem is that Air Dolomiti connects me to my international flights, so when they are late, they have no time to transfer my luggage from the their small jet onto the connecting flight's jet. The result: 3 out of the last 6 of my international flights have had my luggage not arrive at the destination airport. Verified that in each case that they were not loaded from Air Dolomiti to Lufthansa plane due to no time because of late arrival. Yes, Air luggage delayed so often is sure helping Lufthansa frequent flyers. (both owned by same group.) Air Dolomiti is still late.

### "Stone faced and rather rude gate agents"
Lost Luggage. AirTag showed bag remained in Florence with the carrier for 7 days. Staff is not passionate and it shows. Stone faced and rather rude gate agents. Very lacklustre. Worse than a US based low cost carrier. On the plus side, the aircraft was clean.

### "Professional and friendly staff"
Not Verified |  Nice surprise, as an Italian I appreciated a lot the food which could be bought on board (Pasta alla Norma & Red wine Valpolicella). Professional and friendly staff, tasting and authentically Italian food. Proud as Italian to feel these kind of attentions to flyers. Strongly suggested.

### "has been late quite a lot on my travels"
Air Late-omiti. Am a Lufthansa Frequent Traveler, and always have to use Dolomiti for connections to Frankfurt. Yesterday, late arrival. Had to run through the airport to make my connection. In the last 32 sectors over the past 18 months, Dolomiti has been late quite a lot on my travels. Cannot figure out why they even bother to hand out single postage-stamp sized cookie or the single square of chocolate. Why bother? It's just a token, and not a useful one in my opinion. Better to just not hand out anything instead of that fattening little single bite of food. Secondly, staff uniforms seem strange to me: a business suit with a golf shirt underneath and no tie. Third, the pilots tend to keep the seat belt sign on for entire flights, even when there is no turbulence. Furthermore, may I suggest that they review the appearances of their crew: have seen a captain with shoulder length 'surfer-dude' hair - good for surfers - maybe not so good for somebody with a wings badge on their chest.

### "only good at finding excuses for being late"
This company is only good at finding excuses for being late and putting its passengers into trouble. They are always late. And when you arrive no stairs, no bus, nobody to unload luggage.

### "Never again with this airline"
The worst experience ever! Flight Florence-Frankfurt was canceled half an hour before departure! We were already on the gate. Had to go back and wait 5 hours at the airport until the airline rerouted the flight. They decided to fly us from Verona. We waited hours for the bus then they book us a cheap ugly dirty hotel where they put us in the rooms a bag with disgusting sandwiches. They didn’t arrange for our transfer from hotel to airport next day. We had to pay for the taxi! Never again with this airline!

### "an unpleasant experience"
Flight EN8287 on 02 June from Milan to Munich was delayed. Instead of leaving at the scheduled time (4:40 p.m.), it was delayed until 6:35 p.m. I arrived in Munich at 19.40 until all the passengers disembarked, it was 19.50 and I didn't catch the next flight home from Munich to Timisoara which was at 20.10. I asked the flight attendant to inform Lufthansa that we are late and to ask them to wait for me. Then I asked her to let me go out through the back door so that I don't have to wait until all the passengers get off, or to find a solution to help me. This lady from Air Dolomiti did not want to help me. In the end I arrived at 20.10 but the gates were already closed so I had to stay one night in Munich and take another flight the next day. I had an unpleasant experience with this company and I do not recommend it to anyone.

### "have her case under her feet"
I flew with Air Dolomiti twice in May (even though I was initially supposed to fly with Lufthansa, but they changed us to Air Dolomiti). Both flights were late (the first one was 3 hours late and made us miss our connecting flight to the USA). The second flight (from Frankfurt to Trieste) was one hour late. On the second flight, they made my mother have her case under her feet because there was "no space" in the overhead cabins, while they let people keep their backpacks and jackets there.

### "we almost missed our connection"
No organization of passengers or boarding process. The staff loaded 80 passengers onto 2 busses (without any organization for seat/boarding positions which will be a problem later) kept 80 passengers in 2 hot busses for 30+ minutes without A/C turned on (only a couple windows cracked on the doors that weren't broken) and no explanation about the delayed flight or why we weren't being transported to the airplane. After 35 min I stepped off the bus to ask why the delay (as we had a tight connection in Munich if we didn't leave soon)m in rude fashion 3 different men in AD vests told me to get back on the bus. I refused until some explanation about delay, they said there was some issue with the other bus but we would all leave in 2 minutes. So I got back on the bus and they scurried around and we left about 5 min later and they drive both busses no farther than 20 yards to the waiting plane. All the passengers pile into the airplane without any regard for seating priority or placement, but after 30 minutes we all had our seats and then we waited more and taxied. Plane left 30 minutes late and we almost missed our connection. We asked the flight attendant for info about gate arrival and she shrugged and said...we have external gate and a bus will drop you off at Gate L, shrugs and "you'll have to hurry to catch your connection ".

### "a good experience"
The first for me that a plane arrives from the previous flight really on time and we go out late, arrived a little late but the nice stewards compensate all these not so good things. In all a good experience.

### "cabin looked clean and crisp"
In favour of the staff onboard; the attitude was extremely friendly, we got a biscuit together with some water, and the cabin looked clean and crisp. What one can get on low cost airlines doesn’t justify flying with many European full service airlines and that includes Air Dolomiti. The reason I took them was only the time schedule, certainly not for flying premium, as the experience was nothing else than the opposite.

### "definitely fly with them again"
Not Verified |  I booked with Lufthansa and the Frankfurt/Pisa sector was operated by air Dolomiti. Both in Frankfurt and Pisa we were bused to the aircraft. In Fra it felt like we were driving to Pisa. Awful airport. Once on board there was nowhere to store my carry on bag and coat as the lockers in business class were full. Odd as there were only 3 passengers in business. There was someone in my seat when I boarded but I was happy enough to move as he did acually have seat 1B on his boarding card too although he was on an economy ticket, The purser sorted it fast. Seats are small and hard but its generally shortish flights so it's ok. Both of my air Dolomiti flights were breakfast flights and I found the standard of catering to be better than most. It was nicely served and of good quality. I was quite impressed on a short flight. Crew were lovely and attentive on both sectors. Be warned though if you are flying business with Lufthansa out of Frankfurt on the Fra Pisa sector you will not be able to access the business lounge as the air Dolomiti gates to Pisa are in the Schengen area and the lounges are through passport control. Its unfortunate that I had to travel through Frankfurt Main which I think is an overpriced filthy dump. My cases were lost on the way home and didn't turn up for 5 days. Most of the unpleasant parts had very little to do with air Dolomiti. Once on board I found the crew to be lovely and the catering to be far better than most airlines. I'd definitely fly with them again.

### "entitled to the same standard of treatment"
The very short flight was decent. The aircraft clean. When embarking there was a female member of the aircrew welcoming passengers on board - with a simple buon giorno and a smile. When embarking she greeted the passenger in front of me, and behind me - and ignored me. The other male crew members who were offering water and a biscuit and were collecting the rubbish were very courteous. When disembarking this same female member of the aircrew was stood at the exit and greeting passengers as they left. One more she greeted the passengers in front me and behind me and did not greet me. I believe that I am entitled to the same standard of treatment as the other passengers. I do not know the motivations for this particular member of the air crew’s omission towards me - however I do think they fall beneath the standards of her training and basic common courtesy.

### "smallest meal ever in business"
The flight Munich to Brussels booked on Lufthansa was flown by Air Dolomiti . The boarding was extremely unpleasant - we had to go down I think on stairs around 45 steps and put put in a bus - the plane was very far from the terminal building - when the bus arrived at the plane another waiting time. When the plane was finally ready, the pilot did announce a small technical problem so back and repair took around 1 hour and a quarter - a very small drink was offered in a very small glass during waiting time despite FA were friendly the service in business was a disaster - I think the snack can compete for the smallest meal ever in business - 25g of cheese a small piece of pineapple and 2 grapes, no breads  and a very minuscule glass of white wine no refill offered.

### "lost baggage reports is disgraceful"
Not Verified |  Air Dolomiti's customer service and handling lost baggage reports is disgraceful and is a display of the ultimate incompetence of one airline to it's customers belongings. On a long business trip after a flight from Frankfurt to Verona the bag is missing for almost two weeks, Air Dolomiti is putting not even a minor effort to find it or at least reply all the emails. All you can get from Air Dolomiti, after following their lost and found procedures from their website and submitting all their claim forms, baggage content forms and costs reimbursement forms, is a generic email reply. Which gives you no updates, no reimbursement confirmation, no deadlines, no phone number to call. They just don't want to bother. Very frustrating for any traveller as their customers.

### "Avoid especially if booking United Airlines and they code share"
Not Verified |  Avoid especially if booking United Airlines and they code share. My UA app shows my bags being scanned at 11.35 am. My Air Dolomiti flight was delayed boarding so there was plenty of time to move mine and my girlfriends bag for our flight to Florence. They didn’t make it. There was another later flight that arrived about 7.30 pm. Then the next day as well. It is 7.10 pm (27 hours later) and still no bags. My hotel is 1 hr away. The paper the airport lost and found gave me only has an automated system that says “Your bags have been found”. Found where? The guy I spoke to twice today was nice and somewhat helpful and said my 2 bags were picked up by a courier mid morning. Why not at 8 am when the office opens? I ask because after calling United Airlines, they told me our bags came in on last nights flight.

### "An enjoyable flight"
The reviews prior to booking were a concern due to the reported delays/cancellations without notice, so I booked an early AM flight from Florence to connect with a midnight international flight from Frankfurt, to give time for things to go wrong. The end result was 12 hours in Frankfurt waiting for my connection as the Air Dolomiti flight departed and arrived within 10 minutes of the published schedule. Check-in staff were friendly and efficient and the cabin crew had a relaxed and efficient manner with the passengers. Meal, snacks, drinks were offered but declined for a short flight. An enjoyable flight with Air Dolomiti

### "It used to be a wonderful airline"
It used to be a wonderful airline and a true Italian alternative to what the market had to offer. It still has its charm, but clearly Lufthansa as owner has downgraded whatever they could. Now they have the non-existent Lufthansa service, far from anything of a five or four star airline. Purchased this flight as LH ticket and though I was happy to fly Air Dolomiti because of their new planes and always kind crew, I am sorry to see how things are going terribly down: delay, no communication, pathetic little biscuit (which clearly is an embarrassment also to the crew) and a mini bottle of water. Very good is one can access an entertainment system through wifi onboard, not a usual feature on an European regional airline.

### "experience has been horrible"
Not Verified |  Our entire Air Dolomiti experience has been horrible since the moment we showed up to the Florence airport. During check in, we were told that we may not get on the flight. They reserve 15 people from every flight out of Florence that may or may not make it on. Our group of 15 was forced to wait by the check in counter (couldn’t go through security) for hours. The flight kept getting pushed back and back while the front desk agent basically just ignored us. Seemed annoyed when we asked for more info about whether we would make it or not. Finally after 3+ hours of waiting, my boyfriend and I were allowed on the flight (not every passenger was. People who weren’t were crying because in the time they made us wait, they missed out on all of their other options to make it to Munich that day). We check our bags, wait another half hour or so for a bus to take us to our plane where those people who boarded had been waiting for who knows how long. Then finally, when we land, we wait at the carousel for our luggage (which would be a carry on with any American airline). We wait for over an hour in Munich for bags going back and fourth to the Lufthansa help deal to try to get any info at all because Air Dolomiti will not speak with customers. After being told 3 times or so that our bags had made it and we were just waiting, we were finally told that our bags never left Florence. We filed a report with Lufthansa. And it has been two days now and I have yet to hear a word from Lufthansa or Air Dolomiti about our bags. And it wasn’t just two peoples bags. It was 15+. Everyone without a connection did not have their bags. They have no method of tracking bags, no reasonable access to customer service representatives. And from what I can tell, their employees care SO LITTLE, I wouldn’t be shocked if we never see our bags again. We leave Munich in a few days so fingers crossed that will not be the case. But I’m not holding my breath. Air Dolomiti could offer me a completely free flight and I still would not take it. They are that bad and disorganized as soon as the slightest issue arises.

### "Terrible mismanagement and incompetence"
Not Verified |  Terrible airline. Terrible experience. Pilot showed up late past the time for boarding start time. Then they have no one to load luggage so we sat on the tarmac in a full plane for an hour. This airline ruined our plans with others, ruined our next connection and destroyed a day of vacation. Terrible mismanagement and incompetence. I’ll never fly with them again.

### "The crew was very professional"
LH2371 from ZRH to MUC operated by Air Dolomiti. The flight had a delay of 80 minutes, which led to some passengers missing their connections in Munich. The crew was very helpful however, providing the passengers with up-to-date information about connecting flights. The flight itself was very uneventful. The crew was very professional, and passengers were given complimentary water bottles. Because the flight was full, economy passengers with multiple pieces of hand luggage had to check their additional items.

### "could not care less about customers"
They simply could not care less about customers. 4 people who had checked in early were denied seats because airline switched to a smaller aircraft. 4 suitcases lost and not delivered for 5 days. Zero chance to contact anybody and no communication at all from the airline. On return check in one counter for 150+ passengers. Upon asking why there are no more counters open it was suggested "if you want to you can complain". Return trip - luggage lost again. 80 mile delivery takes 3 days +

### "a great experience"
Munich to Amsterdam. A shorthaul flight which is not much different than a regular Lufthansa flight. Level of cabin service is about the same but certainly good enough. Flight attendants were friendly and attentive. They've an inflight wifi system which offers games, newspapers etc. All in all, a great experience.

### "I highly recommend"
Frankfurt to Verona. The plane had very nice livery and very nice design inside. Air Dolomiti colors are very nice. There was very clean inside. After boarding cabin crew gave out refreshing towels in business and economy class. The crew was very friendly and helpful. Air Dolomiti has very nice in-flight service, you can choose between cold drinks, hot drinks, beer and very good wines served in real glasses in economy and business class. There are also some biscuits and sandwiches, but it depends on the flight. IFE was also very good for such a short journey, every passenger can connect their phones to Air Dolomiti WiFi - there are information about the current aircraft position and some videos about Italy. Every travel with Air Dolomiti is travel in Italian Style. I highly recommend!

### "Pleasant flight and great meal"
Catania to Munich. Overall a great flight experience. The cabin crew is very attentive and the plane equipped with an excellent entertainment system that can be used with the on-board wifi on your smartphone, all included in the ticket price. Pleasant flight and great meal.

### "Air Dolomiti worked OK for us"
Munich to Bologna and Pisa to Munich, both on an Embraer 195, economy. Both flights handled efficiently; southbound on time, northbound delayed by about 25 mins on departure due to to late arrival of incoming flight (there had been thick fog at MUC early that morning which had sent things adrift for much of the morning). However, support given to those with tight connections. Modest in-flight service - snacks and drinks - wine came in proper glasses. Other reviewers seem to have had a hard time, but Air Dolomiti worked OK for us.

### "Unorganized, incompetent"
Munich to Pisa. Unorganized, incompetent company, huge disappointment. We were flying to Pisa for a vacation and first our flight got cancelled. We lost $150 on a hotel reservation. Then our rescheduled flight was one hour delayed because their crew hasn’t arrived. The company must be extremely mismanaged because as we were sitting in Munich we saw that other flights were also delayed for the same reason. And all this hassle after we paid $350 for the ticket. Huge disappointment!

### "situation we found ourselves in was a scary one"
Lufthansa flight from EWR to Munich was 10 minutes late, we were a group of 22 and we all raced panic stricken through the unfamiliar airport and customs to make this connecting flight (leaving at 11.15) only to be told at the gate (11.11) that the flight had already left! The Air Dolomiti employee began issuing new boarding passes for a 2.25 flight, but seemed overwhelmed when the rest of our group caught up and sent them all to customer service which is a long way back where they had just come from. A few people got lunch vouchers, most did not, why? At least we all were able to get tickets for next flight, which was delayed twice (why couldn't they have delayed our original flight? we were only minutes late) We finally took off at 4.00. The situation we found ourselves in was a scary one. Anyone who has had a connecting flight knows how stressful it is when one flight lands later than anticipated. It would have saved a dangerous run through the airport if a representative had met us or a message relayed over the loud speaker for all of us to go directly to customer service to be issued new boarding passes for a later flight! Not all of us are Olympic track stars!

### "never again"
Well I'd read reviews about this airline and thought no surely not but after a long stopover at Munich and with not long to boarding my flight was cancelled, no explanation. In the queue there were so many not singing the praises of this airline because they had had this before so instead of getting to my partner who I was meeting there for holiday and not being able due to ill health to stop for 36 hours for next flight Lufthansa flew me home. I would never again go anywhere if Air Dolomiti was choice of travel connection.

### "immaculate plane, comfortable seat"
Turin to Munich. Punctual, immaculate plane, comfortable seat, wine served in glasses also in economy. The staff is kind, offering more snacks on request, smiling. All great. Puntuale, aereo immacolato, sedile comodo, vino servito in bicchieri di vetro anche in economy. Lo staff è gentile, offre più snack a richiesta, sorridente. Tutto ottimo.

### "Good service for short route"
Lyon to Münich. Plane cabin was fairly new with enough legroom. Cabin staff was gentle and they offered possibility to get some snacks and drinks. Good service for short route. Only seat comfort can be enhanced.

### "$224 US dollars for two bags"
Not Verified |  Venice to Munich. Air Dolomiti charged my wife and I $224 US dollars for two bags that weighed under 50lbs each. I paid $100 from Dulles to Munch eight days ago. I was way overcharged but had no choice because I needed my bags to be returned to me in the USA. There fees for bags were not posted anywhere.

### "Worst check in staff"
Worst check in staff. Rude. There were no lines so it wasn’t because I was keeping people from checking in that the staff were so short. Tried to link two Star Alliance tickets. My Husband did the same route two days before, separate tickets. No problem. As I checked my bag in they said it might not make it. Doesn’t make one feel the airline has it together. Alarming, and, sorry to say, lazy. At least I am connecting with Singapore Air. Solitaire member (Gold on Star Alliance). This review is solely based on the check in service.

### "the dirtiest plane"
Not Verified | Frankfurt to Florence. The aircraft could be a newish plane but it was so dirty and very grubby inside. The dirtiest plane I have ever been on. I don’t know who cleans them or the last time it was done. It’s a shame as that is the only problem I found with Air Dolomiti.

### "really impressed with the service"
Munich to Sofia. I'm really impressed with the service. Cabin crew - friendly and responsive. The aircraft (Embraer 190) was clean and with good legroom. Food and beverages were of a higher quality then those of Lufhansa (although it is a subsidiary). Would definitely recommend this airline.

### "best domestic airline in Europe"
Gothenburg to Munich. My flight was a Lufthansa flight operated by Air Dolomiti. I would say that Air Dolomiti makes a better job than the elder brother. The ground crew was helpful. Our flight delayed 35 minutes because of the weather conditions and we were informed by the cabin crew or by the pilot every 5 mins. They served a hand sanitizer napkin before the meal (I only experienced this on intercontinental flights) and the complementary meal service was the best I have ever got on a short haul flight (a tasty sandwich with chocolate cookies, coffee and orange juice and wine). As final before the landing we got a jelly candy. The seat comfort and the cabin temperature were great, the cleanless is very satisfying. The cabin crew was kind and helpful, they got to know my next gate number because of my connection and the delay before the landing and they showed me the gate on a map. The flight was smooth in spite of the horrible weather conditions. Nice job Air Dolomiti! The best domestic airline in Europe!

### "very unimpressed with Air Dolomiti"
I am very unimpressed with Air Dolomiti. We were schedule to depart at 8.55 am but did not leave the air field until 9.43 am and we had an international connecting flight to Munich to connect to Los Angeles. There was never an update over the intercom as to why it was late and the only apology was towards the end of the flight and still no reason was given. Thank goodness we made the connecting flight. Anyone who has ever been to Munich airport will agree that it is not the easiest to navigate through. I will never fly Lufthansa again!

### "a highly recommended airline"
Florence to Munich. For a short flight of about an hour, the onboard service was excellent, the seats pleasant and staff exceptionally friendly. There were also several beverages offered and this was a very pleasant flight in a relatively new aircraft. Air Dolomiti is a highly recommended airline.

### "good flight and on time"
Flew Air Dolomiti from Amsterdam to Munich. Good flight and on time. Crew looked tired and were not very friendly. Plane looked well maintained and clean. Seats very comfortable and good leg space. A small snack was served during the flight.

### "service indeed"
After a fraught day missing a flight from Paris CDG and being rerouted to Genoa via Munich we boarded a well presented Air Dolomiti aircraft only to hear a message from the Captain that there would be a 20 minute delay waiting for passengers from Amsterdam. After they eventually arrived he again came on the intercom to say that he realized we had a cruise liner to meet and he would expedite the flight - and he did flying it like a light aircraft to reduce a 90 minute flight to a 48 minute flight - congratulations to him! The cabin crew were 3 smartly dressed young ladies and the purser was almost in tears when she was the one to tell us that our luggage was not onboard. The snack was, rather strangely, a cellophane wrapped apple but they insisted on us having a second Prosecco "to cheer us up". Then when we landed they came to assist us with our baggage claim - service indeed!

### "best one I'd flown"
Operated on behalf of Lufthansa, this Munich to Geneva route seems to get passed around LH's subsidiaries (I've flown with Augsburg Airways, Lufthansa Cityline and the parent company) but this was the best one I'd flown. Friendly, quadrilingual Air Dolomiti crew (even Swiss crews usually only manage 2-3 languages), nice snack box with and good alcoholic and soft drinks. The interior was very clean, seemed pretty new and I quite like the colour scheme. The seat pitch gave me enough space to work on my laptop, which I don't take as a given any more. All on time - I hope I get them next time I do this route.

### Air Dolomiti customer review
Flights both to Venice and from Venice were fine, on time and relatively uncomplicated. However, it angered us that our carry-on bags, that were by Lufthansa standards (dimensions and weight), had to be checked on the return flight to Munich, yet fit perfectly on our flight from Munich to Venice two weeks earlier. If you have carry-on guidelines and people follow them, they should never be told that they must have to check them! A "carry-on" bag should be just that, one that you can bring on the plane.

### Air Dolomiti customer review
One of the best airlines I have flown with. We flew from Riga to Frankfurt with Lufthansa, and then from Frankfurt to Verona with Air Dolomiti. The flight wasn't long, about 1hr 10 minutes. The flight attendants were friendly. I would recommend.

### Air Dolomiti customer review
The flight was late but the service on board was prompt and affable. The food is particularly nice for a European regional carrier. The biggest problem was that, as in other cases before, the miles were not registered. Every time it takes a series of e-mails to get them registered to Miles and More or other rewards programs.

### Air Dolomiti customer review
I was flying from TRN-MUC last August, the overall flight experience was good. I booked the flight through Lufthansa where Air Dolomiti is their carrier operating from Turin. The cabin crew were polite and helpful. The flight was on time, but the ground crew delayed it a few minutes with moving passengers from the aircraft to the terminal. I flew thrice in the same month on the same route where my overall satisfaction was good.

### Air Dolomiti customer review
LH1964 18 Aug operated by Air Dolomiti. Great service. We were offered very tasteful tramezzino. FA offered 2 or 3 drinks and tramezzino rounds.

### Air Dolomiti customer review
Flight LH9444 from Munich to Bergamo Orio al Serio. Seating 8C (economy class). The short trip was really good and inexpensive. On board the seating was comfortable and the legroom was perfect. Also service on board was good but one hostess was impolite (the only negative note).

### Air Dolomiti customer review
PSA-MUC in June 2014 in economy class. Flight left with +/- 25mins delay due to a medical emergency on board. Spacious cabin in this nice Embraer 195 aircraft. Refreshing towel for hands and face was offered before take-off and after take-off the meal service begun including a sandwich and drinks. Wine is offered in a real glass which is a bonus! Second time for me on this airline and truly to be recommended!

### Air Dolomiti customer review
MUC-FLR in February 2014 in economy flight was full. Plane was clean-although economy was pretty cramped flight staff was pleasant and professional. Air Dolomiti even gave us a snack and a drink on this short flight. Arrived on time. Would recommend (they are part of the Lufthansa network we thought we were booking a LH flight when we booked). Enjoyable experience.

### Air Dolomiti customer review
Flew on a charter from Gatwick to Verona on an Inghams holiday. The flights both ways were on time and 30 minutes shorter than quoted. The staff were welcoming professional and immaculate. The plane was an Embraer 195 and was spotless. Snacks only provided so no comments really well it was a charter. I would not hesitate to fly again with them.

### Air Dolomiti customer review
I'm a New Yorker living in Bergamo Italy. Flying to NYC via Malpensa is not convenient. So I looked forward to trying Lufthansa's route: Newark to Frankfurt (Lufthansa) connecting with their partner Air Dolomiti to Bergamo (Orio al Serio.) Monday August 26 at Newark/Lufthansa check-in I couldn't obtain a boarding pass for the Air Dolomiti flight. After much delay Lufthansa informed me that the flight had been cancelled. According to Lufthansa they were not informed by their own partner. Obviously I was also not informed. Another flight was not available for another 12 hours. This lead to a series of aggravating delays rescheduling mishaps lost (and found baggage) etc. Cancellations happen but why wasn't Lufthansa or the passengers informed by Air Dolomiti?

### Air Dolomiti customer review
I had a pleasantly smooth flight. Service was excellent plane spotless plenty of sparkling wine to keep me company during my flight from Turin to Munich - I wish they flew out of London as well as I would go out of my way to use this company.

### Air Dolomiti customer review
Venice to Munich en route to Toronto 26 October 2012. Arrived at Marco Polo at 5.30 am for 8.45 am flight. Smooth check-in with two young staff members assisting passengers. Our slightly overweight suitcases accepted without comment and no surcharge. Informed our flight was delayed 2 hours (which would have caused us to miss our Air Canada connection in Munich) but we were being put on the 7 am flight which was boarding shortly. Sent past the long line for security check as Priority passengers and loaded on the transporter minutes later. The ATR7 my first non-jet flight took off on time with a full load. Almost immediately we were served a tasty cake with cappuccino by a smiling attendant. Began descent into Munich 20 minutes ahead of the scheduled flight time. A comfortable plane excellent service friendly staff efficient processing.

Flew from Pisa to Munich on an ATR 72. Never flew on that model before and was amazed. Nice aircraft. Service was ok and the flight arrived on time. Seating was ok. Little narrow but then again its only a regional airline. The whole operation had an Italian charm. All in all a nice small charismatic airline.

Rome - Munich: The flight started 15 minutes late and we had a tight connection to Hamburg. Onboard we were greeted with friendly cabin crew handing out newspapers but unfortunately no English ones. The leg room was acceptable for 2 hour flight and seats were soft enough. We were given cheese sandwiches and drinks. In the end we did make it to our connection without being in hurry. All in all a good product from Lufthansa and will definitely recommend them.

Flew Business FRA-BGY-FRA on the same day. Total cost of 180€ return. Service was excellent food was fresh and tasty (cheese ham and fruits on the outbound salmon on the inbound flight). Cabin crew was always smiling. Definitely recommended.

BLQ-FRA in a nice and clean Embraer 195. Loved the interior colours. Good service onboard and very friendly. Tasty snack on this 100 minutes flight.

Pisa-Munich on ATR72. Great experience. Cabin spotless and flight attendants were professional and friendly. Inflight service started with refreshing towel for hands and face. Then offered Italian wine (choices from menu and wine served in a glass) plus a sandwich. Wish they flew in the US.

Frequently flown Frankfurt to Milan (Linate/Malpensa) or Munich to Milan (Malpensa). Airline is good and generally on schedule. But to my utter disappointment the snack on the return leg frequently is only non-vegetarian. Planes are usually small so one can expect a bumpy flight.

MUC-PSA return on ATR72. Plane was small but comfortable. FA's were friendly. Was given a sandwich which surprisingly was actually edible. I've heard good things about this airline and now I know why.

### Air Dolomiti customer review
Flew Air Dolomiti from Munich to Milan. It was a pleasant flight. After being delayed in Toronto for over 3 hrs we originally missed our connection but Lufthansa within 15 mins of landing in Munich got us on the next flight out. It was a very nice flight - the seats were comfortable the cabin-crew staff very friendly and very surprisingly the food (sandwich) was delicious.

TRS-MUC-TRS on AT7. Crew professional no more Settimocielo food box just an apple biscuit and hot/cold drinks. Return 1h 30mins delayed due to technical problems. Crew professional but fed up and tired due to evening delay. Salty nibbles and cold drinks offered. Generally not like it used to be.

### Air Dolomiti customer review
Munich - Rome as a part of our trip from London on a codeshare with Lufthansa The flight left on time and landed early. The cabin crew were really good and and friendly served a nice snack with drinks. Presentation of the plane and crew were spotless . Can recommend this airline.

### Air Dolomiti customer review
BLQ-MUC with ERJ195 very comfortable with huge leg room but cabin extremely dirty. Crew professional and friendly. Food consisted of just a small packed snack + beverages.

### Air Dolomiti customer review
FRA-VRN-MUC Embraer ERJ195 and ATR72. Clean and pleasant cabin with professional crew. Good snacks and beverages offered. Check-in screens were not working in Verona so we had to wait for a quite long time.

### Air Dolomiti customer review
VRN to FRA return with ATR 72 and Embraer 195. The cabin crew was professional and kind legroom was excellent. Newspaper available onboard free. The catering was excellent considering the flight time (1:00 h): into the "Settimocielo" box there were a salty snack a sweet and a small cup of water. Hot and cold beverages (including wines) offered by the cabin crew.

### Air Dolomiti customer review
Flight from Genoa to Munich was very pleasant. Excellent snacks and an overall atmosphere of relaxation throughout the flight. Lots of legroom. Nice plane a little on the noisy side.

### Air Dolomiti customer review
Munich to Venice return with a very nice Embraer 195. Both flights on time snack was tasty and crew was professional. To be quite honest I was not expecting Air Dolomiti to be such a good regional airline.

### Air Dolomiti customer review
TRS-MUC-TRS on AT7. Crew pleasant kind helpful kept passengers informed. Pilot talked to passengers all the time. Meal small but inventive surprising. Stewardesses smile. It seems that EN keeps its good standard!

### Air Dolomiti customer review
MUC-FLR ATR72-500. I have heard rumours of how noisy this aircraft is but to my great surprise it was just a little louder than a jet and I was even seated just beside the engine. Quite acceptable noise level ins the cabin. Flight stewardesses did a terrific work while we were flying over the Alps.

### Air Dolomiti customer review
MUC-Pisa and FLR-MUC : what a disappointment! Half a glass of liquid to drink miniature packet of snacks awful and the only food served in either direction. The aircon wasn't plugged in whilst on the ground and even in the air was hardly noticeable. One of the worst flights I've had. Boarding and disembarkation a shambles. 15 minute wait in aircraft with no air for bus to terminal.

### Air Dolomiti customer review
MUC BLQ return in business. Exceeded expectations. My heart sank at MUC when I realised it was a turboprop flight and I was expecting a LCC experience. Instead I had a nice breakfast of cold meats and bread rolls on the way out. On the return leg they served a nice dessert but I am not a dessert person. Flights were slightly delayed both times but not significantly so. Check in at BLQ was very efficient and the Marconi lounge has its own security lane which makes the whole process more pleasant.

### Air Dolomiti customer review
Recently I experienced my first flight with Air Dolomiti and first time on an Embraer from Frankfurt to Verona. The boarding was punctual. Embraer is a nice plane and I enjoyed the fact that the seats are 2 by 2 only. The service onboard very professional. It was a flawless flight.

### Air Dolomiti customer review
Economy class from Munich to Florence on ATR 72. Aircraft clean though quite loud when seated next to the engine. After reading reviews on this site I did expect a better service. The flight attendants were smiling and friendly however they did not serve me and my girlfriend with beverages I had to request this specifically and the cookies that were the only food served on this late afternoon flight and disapointing.

### Air Dolomiti customer review
Traveled in business class from VCE-MUC and I'm not sure there was any difference in the seats or service in the front but the food was simple and fantastic. Loved that I could have a cappuccino onboard. The crew was friendly and helpful and the all around experience very positive.

### Air Dolomiti customer review
FRA-TRN in economy. Air Dolomiti is one of the best regional airlines around. excellent legroom and service.

### Air Dolomiti customer review
MXP-MUC on a BAe 146 Y class. Good legroom excellent catering even on such a short flight. Flight attendants not smiling but doing their job. Overall a good experience followed by a smooth and easy transit in Munich.

### Air Dolomiti customer review
MUC-FCO: Booked a flight on Air Condor from Munich to Rome for 20 persons. Air Condor cancelled our flight but automatically rebooked us on Air Dolomiti. The flight was on time good snacks and nice flight attendants. I especially liked the way they boarded and deplaned from both the front AND rear of the aircraft.

### Air Dolomiti customer review
Munich to Venice. Originally booked on Condor who cancelled the flight and automatically rebooked me with Air Dolomiti. The flight attendants were professional and very nice. The plane was clean departed and arrived on time and the food/snack service better than any meal/snack I've ever had on a flight in the US.

### Air Dolomiti customer review
MUC-TRN. Air Dolomiti has own check in gate area in MUC with Italian flair (espresso etc). Bussing from gate to aircraft in MUC was quick. Hand baggage can be delivered to A/C hold if not checked in. ATR-42 (or 72?). Leather seats quite a lot of legroom. Small snack served on evening service choice of drinks. FA's english was good. On time arrival in TRN. If they flew regional jets flight time could be reduced against Turboprops. Inflight magazine was well presented. All in all a pleasant flight for a late evening.

### Air Dolomiti customer review
MUC-TRN; GOA-MUC. Flight attendant starts service by offering a refreshment towel followed by a snack. Complementary white wine even offered on the lunch hour service to TRN. Flight attendant from MUC-TRN always wearing a big bright smile that was genuine. You know it's a good airline when the staff believes in the product offered.
