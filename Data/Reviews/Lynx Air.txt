### "lack of customer service"
The flight itself wasn’t awful. My main problem with Lynx Air is their lack of customer service. I was supposed to receive two refunds from them - one for a changed flight and one for a carry-on item that was charged by mistake. I haven’t received either refund and I’m going to have to eat those costs. I’m not the least bit surprised this company is shutting its doors.

### "most disappointing airline experience"
Not Verified |   Lynx Air has been the most disappointing airline experience I've encountered. Their customer service has been notably inaccessible, leading to significant inconvenience. I have been persistently seeking refunds for two flights that were canceled by the airline, to no avail. This situation has been extremely frustrating. shame on them

### "Charged $120 for a small carry on"
Never again will I use this airline and will not recommend to anyone. Rude, mannerless staff, speak with people with absolutely no respect. Charged $120 for a small carry on box and when I emailed them about it, they came up with two different stories that made no sense whatsoever.

### “no longer a ‘low cost’ airline”
Have flown Lynx at least 10 times in the last 2 years and I’m done. Never again. Apart from the endless delays (spent one time 12 hours waiting for my flight to leave without any compensation whatsoever), the fact that you now get charged for a backpack is ridiculous. It is no longer a ‘low cost’ airline if you start adding every thing up, plus the ridiculous flying times. Going back to the traditional airlines! Certainly a lot less hassle.

### "they will not give me any refund"
Not Verified |  Calgary to Toronto February 8 2024 : Flying for uncles funeral, unable to receive boarding pass, went up to counter to retrieve boarding pass, got thrown to the side and told “ I’ll deal with this after I serve everyone else” paid for carry on got my tag ripped off and forced to pay 104$ to put my carry on under the plane as “ the flight is full and there is no room for my carry on”. Got on the plane many seats were empty and my compartment above my seat for my carry on was completely empty. Flight back home from Toronto to Calgary February 12 2024 : flight was delayed 40 min because 3 people were late to the gate people were getting their tags ripped off their bags again and charged 150$ for a carry on. Brought my carry on and had no room to put it so I left it in a full compartment and was planning to move it as I was holding up the line. The flight attendant decided to yell at me that my bag obviously isn’t going to fit there and, I tried to explain I was going to move it I just didn’t want to hold up the line boarding the plane, so she proceeded to grab my bag and throw it in another compartment. Then the Flight attendants seen I was sleeping hit my arm three times with the cart and continued to purposely walk up and down the isle nudging my arm from under me that I had resting on the arm rest. Never said excuse me or watch you arm just utter disrespectful service. I called the company to complain and they said they will not give me any refund or do anything about the service because I’ve already departed my flight.

### "We loved Lynx!"
We loved Lynx! It was Super affordable, planes were on time and no delays. We don’t eat on planes anyway so who cares. Will definitely be flying again.

### "Horrible experience"
Not Verified |   Horrible experience<. Lynx Air canceled the return flight. Because they only fly out of Fort Myers twice a week they wanted to push the return flight 4 days. I suggested an alternative departure and return date and the wanted to charge double the original fare.

### "charging people 150$ for a carry on"
Not Verified |  The worst experience ever both flights, paid for carry on my bag got taken from me tag ripped off and forced me to pay 104$ to put under the plane, mean while it was carry on size and already tagged and paid for, then when I got on the plane my over head was completely empty and they said “ it’s a full flight no room for my bag” empty seats everywhere this was on the way to Toronto. On the way back from Toronto staff was super rude to everyone ripping peoples tags off again charging people 150$ for a carry on like you’re kidding they held the plane 40 min over time for us to take off because there were 3 people late for the flight. No offer for water or food nothing.

### "Terrible experience"
Not Verified |   Terrible experience. Our bags fit under our seats in front with room to spare and they still made us pay 80$. Rude customer service. The way back was fine and the crew did not make us pay for our bags. Have a flight booked for spring and they bumped our flight a day out coming home, which is going to cost me an extra night hotel, childcare and day off work - they are unwilling to compensate in any way. Will never fly with them again after this trip. I would cancel but have a cruise booked. They have an average review of 3/10 for good reason.

### "we will not use LYNX air ever again"
Not Verified | I asked for a refund as we were charged for our check in baggage on a flight that we changed due to sickness. It is very unfair to have to pay for a new bag when all you had to do was change the dates. Apparently, they won't refund for "add-on" services. They said they hope the experience will never be repeated. It won't because we will not use LYNX air ever again.

### "no good reason to fly Lynx"
There is no good reason to fly Lynx. They throw a bunch of flights up to see what sticks then cancel the less popular ones. They will rebook your return flight to be ahead of your departure (impossible). If you actually want to go where you've booked, take a legacy carrier. Lynx has 0 respect for their customers lives (beyond what's expected from a budget airline). Plane was incredibly dirty for a new plane. Dirt and grime ground into the aisle carpet. The two lines in the photo extend the length of the plane. Do they expect me to believe they are maintaining these correctly?

### "worst airline and service ever"
By far the worst airline and service ever and same with their security. We were charged for 2 carry on and one check in 290$ . They made us put all the tags on our bags our selves. All of the workers had a bad tone when speaking with everyone. The security just shove and push and rip open your belongings and broke my purse. They don’t give you enough time to properly unpack your stuff to put through security. I could name more but we just happy we made it through. Every thing we bring on the plane on a normal flight they were giving problems to everyone. People started to put all there clothing on from there cases. Everything is hidden fees by 3 times worse. I can always replace my things but you can’t replace a persons experience.

### "I wish I had stayed away"
Worst airline possible, save yourself and book with anyone else. I didn’t think it was possible for an airline to be this bad. I wish I had stayed away. I can’t believe this company is even allowed to operate.

### “Worst airline”
Not Verified | Worst airline. No food, no charging points. You’ll get bored and you’ll not be able to sleep properly too. Better pay more and travel through Air Canada or West Jet or whatever suits you. Moroever, they make your ticket for $168 or something after that they’ll charge you extra $200 even if your carry on bag is small. I’ll never take this airline again. For you personal item is just a small bag. We’re not going on work we’re going on trip. Personal baggage dosen’t make any sense. Anyways! Thanks for giving me this experience.

### “I really felt like I was being robbed”
When I checked in online, I registered my carry-on baggage but for some reason it was not registered. I tried to explain the situation to the staff but they were very rude and charged me $79! I really felt like I was being robbed. This is an unacceptable practice. I understand that is a low cost company but they shouldn’t feel like they have to rip off customers to make ends meet.

### “This airline is completely unreliable”
Not Verified | Do not fly Lynx Air. The first time I booked with this airline, they moved the flight to a whole different day last minute, completely proving useless based on hotel bookings. I now booked with them again (hoping that it was a one time issue) and they once again moved the flight to a whole different day. Both times had to book another flight last minute (at significantly higher prices) based on hotel bookings. This airline is completely unreliable.

### "a very bad service"
It’s a very bad service. They didn’t let us take any carry on luggage, long flight but not even drinks they serve. Cabin crew  don’t help passengers with anything. I have no idea why those cabin crew for maybe just to sell. We have been travelling so many places we took domestic flight so many times but I would never buy ticket from lynx air. They made us limited to carry stuff. We couldn’t carry our important stuff to visit Toronto for a week. Couldn’t take extra shoe’s because of the limitation. I highly suggest not to go with lynx if you want little bit better service. You can’t even have any water with this airline. We made big mistake to get this.

### "spend more on a regular airline"
Not Verified |  Lynx cancelled my flights with 6-weeks notice. They offered a refund or changed flights. The changed flight option was more than a week after my original flight, and only had one option listed. When I selected a refund, I received an email that said the refund request was approved and would be deposited in 5-7 business days. It has now been 12 business days (3 weeks) and still nothing. Have been on hold with customer service for 23 minutes so far. Just spend more on a regular airline, you'll save time and headaches later on, I think, at this point.

### "Never booking Lynx again"
Absolute worst staff I have ever had to deal with. I have a backpack made by osprey specifically around the British Airways personal item requirements but was stopped in Calgary and the lady said you need to put it in this gauge now. I told her it's built for this and her response was to scold me and and my wife for 20 minutes on how it's not true. In the end we had to pay for 1 personal item with was $90. That is absolutely ridiculous. Once on the plane we sat in row 1 so overheard the flight attendants gossiping about the "difficult passengers" on this flight for 4 hours. Never booking Lynx again and would highly recommend paying the extra bit for a professional experience.

### "Very bad experience"
Not Verified |  Very bad experience. Will never recommend using this airline. Flight was canceled on the day of flying which is about to go to the airport. And no even compensation for that, considering that it is a 24-hour delayed flight. 2The staff at the counter in Montreal are so rude. There's no specific instruction on the carry-on bag at the site and you will be surprised you need to pay another 103.54$. Ground staff and even the shift supervisor need training on how to deal when this problem arises.

### “Very rude and unprofessional”
Very rude and unprofessional/late and disorganised. The worst Airline ever. Worst customer service. Rude staff. I have witnessed some bad behaviour from two males in specific. One at the boarding gate was literally shouting at an old man just for asking him. Another one was shouting at a passenger asking him to stop music. The same host didn't intervene when there was a conflict between two passengers and that was disturbing. These guys aren't presenting you well (I don't want to talk about the delay and the disorganisation) because customers can still accept some transgressions but not when it comes to being rude, no one accepts that.

### “never fly this airline”
Literally never fly this airline. We arrived to the airport at 5AM for a 7AM flight from Toronto to Tampa. The bag check area was a complete disaster with no organization at all. After waiting in line for 15 minutes and going no where, getting no updates and receiving zero communication on our flight, I walked up to the ticket counter cutting over 100 people in line because I knew we were approaching the 75 minute rule to bag check before our flight. I was pushed to 2 different attendants while getting mixed information from each. Finally I was placed at one mans stand and the woman next to him said it was "his call" if they accepted our bags or not. He then spent 5 minutes on the phone and said he would not accept our bags. I then asked if he was able to put my bags on the next flight and he said that "they don't do that" I then asked if they had a shipping area in the airport to ship our bags and he replied "there is no where that does that". I then asked if he could get us on the next flight and he said "no, you need to call customer service". I then began to call customer service and was continually hung up on, after the 6th call the woman next to him told me that the office didn't open until 9AM. I left the airport and called LYNX over 30 times with no resolution to my problem, everyone kept saying I was a "no show" even though they took my information at the bag check. I have sent over 25 emails to their customer service email and have been given no refund. This airline is horrible and a total scam.

### "90$ Lynx Air charge for carry on"
Avoid at all costs. I am sitting at Calgary airport writing a review because I declined to get on the plane due to rudeness of staff. I only asked if I could pay for my carry on and the manager started yelling at me. You will end up paying as much as air Canada with the almost 90$ Lynx Air charge for carry on.

### "lack of professionalism, absolute rudeness"
My experience with 2 of the check in staff at the Calgary airport was nothing short of a sever lack of professionalism, absolute rudeness and point-blank humiliating. My mother had unfortunately brought the wrong size of bag for the trip. She made sure not to exceed the 7kgs of weight but didn't realize size also mattered. Although her bag was mostly empty, they wanted to charge us for the empty bag. Since my mother couldn't speak any of the 2 official languages, and we were on separate flights, when I asked if anything could be done for my mother's luggage that was mostly empty but just oversized, the check in staff at the Calgary airport responded very rudely, saying not to tell her how to do her job, and whether I wanted to do her job. When I called her on her rudeness, she threatened to cancel my flight and then to call security. This happened after I tried to deescalate the situation, smiled at her, asked her to take it easy. But she pursued with her threats. She then threatened that she will also "be on the other side", I can only assume she meant at the departing gate, which she was. It was very humiliating and degrading. We were treated as if were disobedient children that needed to be punished. I ended up going to another counter to pay for my mother's bag. She followed us to the other end of the counter aisle, spoke in Hindi to her colleague about us and laughed at us. She clearly did not expect me to understand Hindi as well. I called her on it, simply saying it was very unprofessional of her to do so and that I understood everything she said. My brother asked her to leave us alone, to stop following us, that we had paid for both bags and to stop harassing us at this point. All this while a crowd queued up for check in, was watching. The airplane staff however were respectful, professional and just nice in general. The Pearson site supervisor for the airline apologized for my poor experience despite not knowing what had happened. He politely asked and I just said they were unnecessarily rude. Comments cannot be provided over the phone, only via email. I wasted over an hour on the phone and was hanged up on before I could ask any other questions. It is cheap flights but at the cost of a degrading experience. Respect and dignity are a must. It seems like for this airline, the cheap flights are in exchange of those.

### "promised to sent compensation"
Worse company ever. flights delays, promised to sent compensation back in September for delay. Last email from them was back in November that compensation is coming within 14 days, still waiting.

### "cannot take off your winter jacket"
Extremely slow check in process. Was not sure to laugh or blush when staff told me you cannot take off your winter jacket and put it in your back pack while getting on board.

### "I had an amazing flight"
When I booked with Lynx Air, I was apprehensive because of all the bad reviews I read from other people who had flown with them. I can now say, after flying round trip with them, that I had an amazing flight. You get what you pay for, people. I was very happy with my flight. The staff may seem rude to you, but I have seen the awful way flyers have treated them. They are just doing their job. They have to measure your carry on, that's what they are told to do. If your bag doesn't fit in their measuring tool, that's on you. There are many places that it is clear on the sizes. Just make sure your bag is not bigger than their standards. Pretty straight forward. Again, this may seem extreme, but you are getting a discounted flight. As for the service on the plane, there is nothing. No food or drink for purchase. But it is a budget flight. I would 100% fly with Lynx Air again. Loved the prices, loved the simplicity. The landings on all flights I took were some of the smoothest I've experienced. If you want all the bells and whistles, don't choose Lynx Air.

### "never recommend this airline"
Not Verified | Flight from YYZ to LAX was cancelled three times, Flight from LAX to YYZ cancelled again twice. This is a horrible airline. I would never recommend this airline to anyone, better to pay extra and save your precious time.

### "force you to pay for bags"
Not Verified | The worst airline you can ever travel with. They force you to pay for bags that are small enough to be allowed by all low cost airlines. I was charged $83 for a tiny backpack. The staff there said they don't even work for Lynx Air. You won't find a single Lynx employee if you have any issues at the airport. I was on hold with customer service for over 2 hours and they dropped my call.

### Lynx Air customer review
Not Verified | Never heard of this airline but they were offering an affordable flight to Toronto. Leaving LAX we were delayed about an hour but the gate agent was very communicative with updates. Everyone needed their carryon tagged & needed to have a paper boarding pass, not one passenger had an issue. When we boarded it was quick & easy. The seats were a bit hard, they offered no Wi-Fi, or any food or beverage. Luckily I always bring my own food & buy water at the airport. Now leaving Toronto was the worst experience of my life! There was no line to check in or check my bag. There was about four ticket agents behind the counter. I stood there for about 4 to 5 minutes looking and making eye contact with one agent several times while another agent was ducking behind the counter on her phone, and the agent next to her was talking to her. I decided to walk to the counter and ask if I could check in. The agent hiding stood up and she asked me to place my bag to be weighed. The other agent asked me to see my carry-on bag so I showed her. They looked at each other and one told me to go see if my bag fit in the box. Immediately, I realized I needed to take my sweater out of the bag. I also accidentally brought a bottle of salad dressing that I also took out of the bag. After I took those items out the bag fit effortlessly. I went back to the counter and they looked at each other and said with an attitude “I didn’t see her bag fit” and the other one said me either. So I walked back over and put it in the box again where it fit effortlessly. The agent proceeded with her attitude & told me that I could not have my sweater in my hand, nor could I have the salad dressing in my hand. I let her know I was putting the sweater on & I was going to be throwing the salad dressing bottle away as it couldn’t go through security anyway. Now a third agent joined. She asked if I wanted to put the dressing in my check in luggage & I declined. I said I would rather throw it away. Now they continued to discuss the salad dressing bottle as well as an almost empty gallon of water bottle that I had. Again, I let them know I was going to be throwing it away. They told me to take my bag to the drop & I left the counter. They offered no information on how to get to security or the gate so I ended up asking another airline. Now when I got to the gate, they stated all bags needed to be tagged & a paper boarding pass needed to be printed. I stood in line, and when it was my turn, they scanned my boarding pass. The girl looked at the screen and looked at my boarding, pass several times & then called her manager or supervisor. The supervisor told me that there was a note on the computer that said, I was rude to the ticket agent and they should not let me board the plane! She asked me what happened and I told her there were three agents that had an attitude with me about my carry-on bag. The supervisor said I did not pay for the carry-on which I stated I did not need to because it fit in the box. She again stated that the computer has a note that I was rude & had a attitude & pointed at the screen & said look. I attempted to look & she quickly turned the computer screen away & said I could not see it. And I stated “well you told me to look so that’s why I did that.” She smirked & again said “I do not have to let you board because they’re asking me not to. However, I am using my discretion to let you board.” YYZ employees are extremely rude for no reason & want you to pay for your bag!

### “I'm still waiting for my refund”
Not Verified | The worst airline and customer service. If I can save people the hassle, waste of time and waste of money learn from my mistake and, do not book with Lynx or EDreams. I had a flight booked in November leaving from Vancouver airport to Montreal to attend a family emergency. I got to the airport and they laughed at me and said my flight wasn't that night and it got changed to 2 days later. I had never gotten an email about the change and now both companies are blaming each other. It’s now January and after many calls throughout the months I'm still waiting for my refund.

### “Delays upon delays”
Not Verified | Horrible airline. Delays upon delays, unsanitary plane, terrible communication and rude staff. Would not reccomend to anyone. Never again, terrible.

### "schedule was delayed 4x"
I’ve been at the airport since 5am the schedule was delayed 4x from 6:55am, 11:00am, 11:30 am then 12:20pm. When I arrive in the morning at 5am they gave a $10 voucher for breakfast then around 11:59am they announced that they are giving food voucher for the delay but when I lined up the staff said that I already had my voucher which was the breakfast, so no need to have for lunch. The service for Lynx air sucks. Never to ride again with this airline.

### “customer service was horrible”
Lynx Air is the worst airline I’ve ever flown. The airline pushed my departure time twice. Took them forever to board their customers. And even after boarding, it took the pilot(s) forever to take off as the plane was going round the tarmarc for over an hour. The customer service was horrible. Having paid a huge amount for my flight from Calgary to Toronto and back, the airline still charged me a whopping sum of $168 (to and Fro) to have my small luggage tagged. I spoke to the manager at the counter, he said he would look into the charges but I haven't heard from Lynx since. I'm highly disappointed as the airline is all about just taking your money and not providing great customer experience.

### "have not received any payment"
The flight was on time and the service was BUT they have lost my luggage. Nobody at the airport to help because the flight has already flight back. I live in Montreal. 2 days after, Got a message to come pick up my luggage in Vancouver the day after, got a message to come pick up my luggage in Calgary and then they never found my luggage. I sent messages sometimes and i feel that they were not checking. Sometimes they were writing me: have you found your luggage? Sorry you should tell me. As an organized person, i sent all my receipts the week after the lost in September. They approved my purchases also in September. But after 4 months i still have not received any payment. I write every 2 weeks and they tell me i am sorry. I pay interest every month on my credit card for the stuff i needed to buy.

### “airline is extremely unreliable”
Not Verified | This review is about an upcoming flight. I booked a flight and made other reservations for my trip. Lynx emailed and said flight was changed and I rebooked, and updated my other reservations (had to pay penalty). Then, Lynx emailed again and changed the flight time. I accepted. Then, Lynx cancelled the flight again, and I had to cancel everything and my other reservations (hotel, etc.) and lost more money. This airline is extremely unreliable and should be avoided at all cost. Nothing is cheap for no reason. Lesson learnt!

### “last time flying with them”
Flight was delayed from 9:15pm to 10pm to 11pm to 11:45pm but didn’t leave until 12:15AM, the boarding pass said they were boarding 12:15AM but the flight gate was closed 11:30PM. We got to Calgary 3:05AM which was around 5 hrs, waited for my luggage till 4AM because Calgary was short staffed, if it can’t get any worse they left my checked bag in Montreal and told me to call customer service that opens at 8AM. When I did they say they will try to get me my bag within 48 hrs, I’m still waiting on a call back, last time flying with them just ridiculous.

### “You’ve been warned!”
Not Verified | NEVER AGAIN! I arrived at the St Johns Nfld airport to find out that my Lynx flight had been cancelled and rescheduled for three days later. They ‘claimed’ that I had been informed 14 days prior of the cancellation and was not eligible for compensation. Not true…no email was ever sent. You’ve been warned!

### "worst airline I have ever flown"
This is the worst airline I have ever flown. Prior to my flight they cancelled my original flight twice prompting me to have to make alternate arrangements for accommodation. Then on the day of departure the flight was delayed twice last minute for no apparent reason, departing 3.5 hours late. Finally on the returning flight there is a delay but they are not announcing anything and refusing to answer any questions. It’s been 3 hours since the original departure and they “have no idea” if the flight is delayed further or if will be canceled. The worst airline. Never again.

### "we will never fly Lynx again"
Not Verified |  Lynx Air has clean, comfortable and safe aircraft. Our rides to and from destinations have been enjoyable. However, booking our flights in July of 2023, Lynx had failed to notify us of flight changes leaving us stranded in and around an airport for 9 hours. Then once the check in stations had opened we were greeted by another problem with their service. When we booked our flight we had to pay 300 dollars (CAD) for our luggage, (we had receipts to prove we had purchased checked luggage), Lynx had claimed that we didn’t pay for our luggage with the receipts in our hands and having flown to our destination previously, we were shocked and confused. Ultimately, having to pay another 300$ USD (we are canadian). Then later that evening once we had boarded the plane we had sat on the tarmac for an hour, pushing our shuttles and hotel booking back an extra hour, causing us more stress. Unfortunately, we will never fly Lynx again and would not recommend unless you are wanting to experience deals and un resourceful staff.

### "food didn't have to fit under the seat"
When you buy the ticket, they tell you that you can take a personal item that can fit under the seat in front of you. I travelled with a backpack that has fit under many airplane seats, and fit easily under the seat when I did get on the plane. But as I was waiting to board, a man called me out of line and asked me to fit my bag into a tiny box with an opening about 30cm by 15cm. When it didn't go in easily, he said "you will have to pay. I replied "I'll get it in there" and kept stuffing. We went back and forth like this for a long time. Finally, the man started helping me: "Do you have any food? he asked. Apparently, food didn't have to fit under the seat in front of you (why didn't he mention that before?). By removing two water bottles and a Costco-sized carton of chocolate caramels, I fit the pack in that tiny box. He allowed my wife to remove her coat from her bag. I don't know how much they charge, but if I had purchased a carryon item ahead of time, it would have been $92 CAD, and the web-site said it would cost more at the gate. The people are nice, but the airline policy is to lure you to the gate where they tell you that if you want to fly, you must pay extra. If you fly this airline, make sure you can pack your bag into an opening 15cmx30cm. I don't remember the other dimension very clearly.

### "refused to refund me that $180 in upgrades"
Be very careful! Luggage was underweight in Toronto, we brought nothing extra back and was charged $75 US in overweight charges in Orlando. Even though I argued with them that their scale was incorrect and in fact showed them a screenshot of the airport scale and that their scale was incorrect they still charged me. We also upgraded to seats with extra leg room as we are tall, they refused to refund me that $180.00 in upgrades even though they admitted to a aircraft change. All in all this is a low cost airlines, no bell or whistles. We didn't even get water service on the way back to Toronto. The initial flights might be cheap but they charge if you sneeze! In the long run with carry-on's and luggage we paid more than if we had flown with Air Canada. The prior reviews of delays are very real, we were delayed twice in Toronto and 3 times in Orlando making what should have been a 2.5 hour flight into a whole day of travel. I would rather pay more than fly with this airline again.

### "My flight was very much delayed"
This airline is a joke! Not cheap at all. They don’t have customer service over the phone, and their website is erroneous you couldn't download a boarding pass. If you wanted to modify anything, you are unable to do it online. There’s no 24-hr customer service to call also. My flight was very much delayed. I will avoid this airline from now on.

### "terrible traffic for support"
Overcharged for a carryon because of technical issues of the website, terrible traffic for support, and the lack of option to add a carryon to my reservation online, even if you still have 24 hours. The SMS notifications that an agent wants to talk to you did not load the chatroom, but sent me to help page where I had to requeue and end up at the end of the line over and over again, putting me behind 100s of people. After the 6-7th attempt, it was too late to resolve an issue that would take a few seconds to solve, because I already had to pass baggage. Sure is a smart way to overcharge the clients. I had to pay 30% than the original price because of this. By the way, the bot kept suggesting I add the carryon online myself, but the link it sent me would just lead to my booking that was already checked in. I would fix the bot suggestion to direct a client to agents right away. Thanks for nothing.

### "Overall a fantastic experience"
Not Verified |  I am really impressed with Lynx Air. The plane was very clean and welcoming. Staff made you feel safe and even provided some comic relief which is nice for an apprehensive flyer. It is a basic airplane and all you get is water but for the value I would completely fly with them again. Overall a fantastic experience.

### “Be a company who thinks of their customers”
Not Verified | More than a week before the departure date, I have a family emergency as my grandma is in a critical condition and we need to visit her right away. Lynx Air said they can do a partial refund but not to the original payment method but just a travel voucher. I'm just shocked how a company have this kind of policy for not giving any refund policy. Based on this personal experience I don't think we should ever book ahead with Lynx Air, other airlines I know do give a refund or partial refund at least to the original payment method and not just a voucher. Be a company who thinks of their customers and not just for the profit.

### "don't think I have met a nicer crew"
This was my third time flight with Lynx. Yes you pay extra for luggage but this is all explained on their website so there should be no surprises. And you need to pack a lunch if you think you will get hungry. I have always found the cabin crew to be very pleasant. I have flown on many airlines and I don't think I have met a nicer crew then on my recent Lynx flight.

### "charge me $90 for the same backpack"
This was the worst airline I have travelled with. Terrible customer service. I was not charged for a carry-on on my way from YYZ to YEG, but when I returned from YEG to YYZ they decided to charge me $90 for the same backpack, the same that I have previously used in the first flight.

### "charged $85 for my backpack"
Worst Airline. They charged $85 for my backpack because the strap didn’t fit in. They nickle and dime you for ever cent. Do not recommend that you use this airline.

### "they charge an extra $100 fee"
Not Verified |  Almost all backpacks and bags are considered as a carry on and as a result they charge an extra $100 fee on top of any checked bags and ticket. Boarded us an hour and a half early before actually taking off. Based off my experience and reading other reviews I’d recommend flying with a different airline.

### “I will never fly Lynx again”
Not Verified | Simply put, I will never fly Lynx again. Delays in both directions. Inability to scan phone tickets resulting in the slowest boarding I have every experienced, archaic bag tagging further delaying boarding, and ludacris bag size expectations. I almost had to check my carry on bag (a standard size carry on product) because one wheel didn't fit their ridiculous bag size measurement bin. They were delayed so they "let it go this time". Terrible airline. Not to mention, if you are doing a carry on and a personal item, it no cheaper than Air Canada or West Jet. Just simply a worse experience.

### "the worst airline in Canada"
Not Verified |  Not only do they charge for carry-on bags, but they also charge for seat selection and priority boarding. And don't expect any complimentary snacks or drinks on board, because they charge for those too. The worst part is, you don't even get what you pay for. Lynx flights are notorious for being delayed, cancelled, or overbooked. Their customer service is non-existent, and their refund policy is a joke. They will make you jump through hoops to get your money back, or offer you a useless voucher that expires in a month. Lynx is not a budget airline, it's a rip-off airline. They lure you in with low fares, but then nickel and dime you for everything else. You end up paying more than you would with a reputable airline, and get a much worse experience. Save yourself the hassle and avoid Lynx at all costs. They are the worst airline in Canada.

### "learnt a costly lesson"
First time experience with Lynx and learnt a costly lesson. Once you have paid for anything - ticket, seats, baggage etc, the money is gone forever, Its like a blackhole. If you are lucky, they may issue a voucher but never your money. The initial price was good so we booked 3 return tickets from Los Angeles to Calgary, not realizing that costs will start piling up. Added the carry-ons [$35/piece] online as cost at the airport is $50 per piece. Went to the airport and the flight was delayed twice, making us miss all connections and bookings. So we did not board and asked for refund on the entire trip. Airport staff is outsourced and were unable to help in any way. Called the airline number and was on hold for 50 minutes - after which the Agent told us to contact them back, 3 hours after departure. Tried getting in touch again - the calls kept getting disconnect and site was down. Next day tried the Chat and after 1 hour 30 minute wait, got a live agent. There was no refund on the outbound flight - not even the $105/- paid for the carry-ons or the taxes. Reason - the flight was late by 2 hours 53 minutes and not 3 hours. The return leg was cancelled but after a penalty of $35/ticket and again, the taxes and fees were not part of the refund voucher. Ended up loosing $500 during this process. So realized that do not go with Lynx unless 1. You are absolutely sure about date/time 2. There are no dependencies of connections, bookings, rentals etc 3. Not travelling with young kids 4. Don't care about WiFi or charging your phone. 5. Ready to never see your money 6. Able to use voucher [if lucky] for future travel

### "This is the worst experience"
Our December 24th, 5 pm nonstop flight from Toronto to Vancouver was changed to a one-stop flight with a 40-minute layover in Winnipeg. Upon landing in Winnipeg, the flight was canceled, requiring us to leave the plane with our belongings. We were instructed to take a hotel, with the promise of reimbursement, and the substitute flight was scheduled for December 25th at 11 am, later delayed to 2 pm. The airline now refuses to reimburse the hotel cost, citing the flight cancellation. This nearly full-day delay has prevented me from spending Christmas Day with my family, and I've incurred additional expenses due to these disruptions. The lack of clarification on the reasons behind these issues is frustrating. I expect accountability for these inconveniences caused by this awful Lynx airline company. This is the worst experience I’ve ever had!

### "completely torturous experience"
This was a completely torturous experience for us. It was my first time trying Lynx Air, but unfortunately, it did not go well. The flight was delayed for 4 hours without any valid reason or an apology for the inconvenience. I can't believe this airline actually exists. This was such a bad experience that I would rate it 1 star and never recommend anyone to try this airline.

### "experience was extremely pleasant"
This is my first experience with Lynx, and I was very nervous, having read a number of reviews. I am happy to say that my experience was extremely pleasant. The price was great, as I did not bring any baggage other than a personal item. By that I mean a small backpack that I was able to fit a laptop and a few clothing items and toiletries in. Nobody batted an eye at the boarding gate to give me a tag either way. The crews on board [4 different crews] and at the ticket counter in both Vancouver and Hamilton were fantastic. By that I mean really awesome! There was only water served on the YCC to YHM Leg. There are no USB ports or films to watch, so bring your own. All of this information is clearly outlined in the mini emails you will receive. I had only a boarding pass on my phone and that was fine as well. The flight leaving was on time, but we were 1.5 hours delayed returning because of the delayed inbound flight. The price was very steep if you wanted to bring carry-on baggage to go in the overhead compartment. But if you don’t need to, then I would recommend this airline.

### "Lynx has good value for money"
Arrived at the airport in Calgary with my boarding pass already printed off. I had prepaid for a checked bag so I went to the check in desk to drop it off. The agent I spoke with was not wearing anything that identified them with Lynx air, I suspect that she worked for a third party FBO that Lynx contracted to save money. Such is the ULCC experience. The gate agents were rude and their instructions were unclear. The one constantly made announcements to come to the gate to have your boarding pass printed if it was not already printed. But people had already "printed" off their boarding pass at home. I feel like the gate agents could be a little more professional in their operations. Besides that I had a good experience with Lynx. I was in Calgary and now I am in Vancouver. I booked my flight for over the holidays in August and for me to fly one way with a check bag and a seat in the emergency exit row was $153 CAD. Lynx has good value for money but don't expect any extra perks. If you're simply looking to get from point A to point B then I recommend Lynx.

### "Had a great experience"
Had a great experience with Lynx! I was a little worried after reading all of these negative reviews but they are a low cost carrier so you can’t expect the same benefits as other expensive airlines. For what you receive it is definitely worth it. Was a little delayed boarding but still arrived shortly after the scheduled arrival time. Overall very happy and will be using them again.

### "Stay away from this airline"
Stay away from this airline at all cost! I don't know why I gave them a try. I was stupid. The departure flight I got an email saying that it is delayed by 4 hours, from 4pm to 8pm. Then there was a second email saying that the flight was further delayed to 8:45pm. My friend arrived the airport at 6:30pm but he couldn't find any staff working on check-in. He has a snowboard bag. Eventually he gave up the flight. I asked the staff lady at the boarding gate why there was nobody at check-in? She said it was closed and she didn't see my friend. Perhaps there was a fine print that the check-in close 90 minutes before departure. But the departure is 8:45pm, not 8:00pm! This delay costs me a lot. When I arrived Calgary airport, it was about 1:30am. My rental car company Hertz closed. Therefore, I have to pay a very expensive fee to get a car from Avis nearby. I hope Lynx can reimburse this extra rental car cost but they never answer my phone call. The delay also ruined my ski trip. My friend didn't board so I have to pick up him the next day (he booked another WestJet which is much more reliable). The 2nd leg is not good too. There are many check-in counters in Calgary airport. The staff were not well trained. I didn't know that the international check-in counter is at the other end until the staff told me after I waited about 20 minutes. Then at the international check-in, the guy didn't know how to use the oversized luggage computer. A lady from westjet told him how to open the gate. The most outrageous part is the bag waiting time. The plane landed at 9:40am local time in Los Angeles. My bag was showing up at 11:07am. I took pictures to verify the 1.5 hour bag waiting time. There was a Lynx lady at the site. She told me that there were two planes unloading at the same time so they decided to unload the bags after the plane from Toronto arrived? This is the most ridiculous and most stupid cost saving idea. What about customers of the plane that arrived first? Finally, the in-flight service is simple but I don't understand why there are 4 flight attendants as there was just one free water service. The European budget airlines just have 2 flight attendants and they are busy from very beginning to very end of the journey. This airline doesn't know where to save money and control the cost. The management definitely has no experience. The only positive point is the seat pitch. It's the most generous among all the budget airlines I have flown. Perhaps exceeding some top-tier carriers. However, there was no food, no WiFi, no charger, no screen and hard to understand the accent of pilot. Anyway, this airline devastated me and my friend.

### "Lynx will never see me again"
First issue, flight was rebooked for a day later than it was supposed to leave for vacation. Arrived at the airport to rude and argumentative gate agents. Arguing with me about my 'small backpack' which is approved on their website. They told me it has to be a purse. They demanded I pay 85 dollars or have them stand over me while I remove my medication and a sweater from my bag and transfer it to my friends bag. They repeatedly made me put my bag into the measuring device at which point the zipper on my bag broke. Still sitting on the tarmac now. Being told the airplane has to be restarted so we must sit out here with no power for the next 5 mins. So awful I'm considering getting off and staying home. 1000 out of 100 do not recommend. Thank God I'm coming back in Westjet. Lynx will never see me again.

### “Charged us for their screwup”
Not Verified |  First they changed flight home to one day earlier. Then week later changed flight to from a Saturday morning to Sunday night. Lose 3 days of an 8 day holiday. No alternatives available. Cancelled. Charged about 20% to cancel. Charged us for their screwup. Never again will I book a Lynx Air flight.

### "I have to pay for the carry-on"
I was flying from Toronto to Nova Scotia on December 1st 2023 by Linx Air. At the airport I came to know that I have to pay for the carry-on. So, I paid online with booking number and I showed that to the lady in counter, she is like "you cannot pay online at the airport you have to pay again at the counter. whatever you paid you will be able to use that on your return flight" - so, I paid again in the counter. When I was returning back from Nova scotia on December 3rd, they said my carry-on is big I have to checkin the bag. So, I asked can I upgrade? She is like you cannot upgrade now, you have to pay full amount now. And you can connect customer service later they will refund the money for the carry-on. I called customer service, the lady said she is like sorry you can get money back. Then when I argued with her again and again she is let me check with booking number, after checking with booking number and keeping me online for almost hr, she said I can only refund the difference. But I explained her what do you mean by difference because there is no difference. I paid twice, so I should get refund for the carry on but she is like sorry I can just refund the difference. Basically they are charging again and again and steal money from peoples pocket. Please stay away from them.

### "nickel and dime you for every penny"
They nickel and dime you for every penny and charge you an astronomical price of over $70 for a carry on. First and last time I'll ever fly with this joke of an airline. I should have selected the WestJet or Air Canada flight. Especially after just coming off an 11hr flight with Cathay Pacific which is a top notch airline. Never again.

### "Terrible Experience"
Not Verified |  Terrible Experience with Lynx Air. From start to finish, the entire process was a nightmare. They delayed the flight without informing then I had to wait there for 4 hours at the airport. They checked me in and I had my boarding pass, was waiting in the waiting area then they cancelled the flight for some reason. When I went to the counter's to inquire about flight cancellation, literally no one was there and I waited for LYNX staff members for 45 minutes and no one showed up. I was at the airport from 4am till 3pm, they have lost my luggage as well and no body helped me. Now, I’m going all the way back home without my suitcases. Such a terrible experience. Please don’t book your flight with them

### "highly recommend flying Lynx Air"
I loved flying with Lynx it was amazing. My flight was extremely cheap. It was really clean and spacious. The flight was on time and although they didn’t offer drinks they did offer water. Very friendly flight attendants. I would highly recommend flying Lynx Air and will definitely fly with them in the future.

### "ask to be reimbursed"
They had dimensions on their website for a personal item, I literally followed the dimensions. Upon my arrival at the airport, a Lynx airlines employee was in charge for inspections with a box indicating the required dimensions (not the same as on the website), so I had to pay 101 CAD! Same thing on my way back 90 CAD. I contacted Lynx airlines to explain my experience and that ask to be reimbursed, first got an email telling me to check the dimensions on their website, then I responded attaching a proof of the dimensions of my backpack (within the range indicated on their website) and good thing I had them captured at the time of the incident, I got a reply saying "The Airport will charge you for overweight and oversized baggage as they are basing off on certain criteria at the airport and are the ones doing the inspection before each and every flight.

### “We will definitely come back!”
We flew to Orlando on Nov 26 Y9605 and return on Dec 5 Y9705. 1. The pilots' skills on departure and arrival were amazing. I had some smaller aircraft like 737 before. These two experience are very good. 2. There was a hiccup during our way to Orlando. We were sent to Air Canada for some missing documents for an hour. Ended up they realized it and asked us to go back to the Lynx check in. I didn't understand why we had to go back to the check in as Lynx had done the check in. Nobody was there anymore. At the moment I thought we must miss the fight, Lynx called us and waited for us at the last minutes. We really appreciate it. 3. After we arrived in Orlando, I contacted Lynx with the missing documents. Although it is a long wait on the phone, they did their best for the arrangement for rest of us. We really appreciate it again. 4. The price is fair. They only provide water. It is a good way not to interrupt our rest. Some other airline selling foods, duty free and etc. I personally don't like it at all. 5. The bags pick up is very fast on both ways. I am not sure if it is because Lynx Air or local airport service. Just want to give a thumb up. Overall, I wish Lynx Air can get more and more customers because Lynx Air deserves it. We will definitely come back!

### "very happy with the service"
On the way to Toronto the flight was delayed but I expected that was a possibility so I made sure that I checked to see before I left for the airport. I have to say that they're communication was amazing I received many emails updating me. For the price that I got this flight I was very happy with the service and with the plane itself. I was a little nervous at first when I read the reviews but I had a very good experience with them

### "not hesitate to travel with them again"
Not Verified |  I flew round trip from Toronto to Phoenix - both flights left and arrived early! Sadly no where near sold out, everyone had their own 3 seats. Planes are brand new, lots of leg room compared to Air Canada Rouge. I got the tickets for $250, can’t go wrong for that! They often have sales on their website. Flight crew and pilot had great communication. They actually kept the lights dimmed for the night flight! As a budget airline, there is only water served - bring your own food and drinks. There is no entertainment and no plugs, so come prepared. I brought a 6x13x17 inch mini duffel bag which counts as my personal item, and you can got a lot in there, no need to pay for a carry on! I have 3 more Lynx flights booked, would not hesitate to travel with them again!

### "I was told my bag was too big"
Leaving Toronto I was told my bag was too big, I transferred most item and still got charged $110. This is ridiculous since it went under the seat just as a small bag went wasn’t too big, just a ripoff. Coming home from Tampa the flight was delayed 2 1/2 hours and then we got to Toronto. We sat in a plane for nearly half an hour because there was no ground crew to push the bridge over to the plane so we can get off. The plane was probably 90° with no air-conditioning. I don’t think I’ll ever fly on this airline again.

### “Customer service is not a priority”
Not Verified |  I would have sent my boarding pass but was unable to get it online. They said it was a malfunction. There was no one at the Lynx desk and I missed my flight. When I called, they could not help me. They said basically tough luck. My friends who were on the same flight caught the plane. Customer service is not a priority for you!

### "we had to pay for bags"
When going in to check in for my flight the flight attendant was so rude and told me and my husband we had to pay for bags that we were told when purchasing the flights we did not need to pay for. She then asked twice if my last name Was Ahmed (I don’t know why that’s a problem). Just so rude worst airline I’ve flown with and I’ve flown with a lot of airlines and never had to make a review.

### "cozy, on time & nice"
Liked this airline! They were organized, cozy, on time & nice. Will definitely fly with them again. Internet & entertainment should be added though.

### "highly recommend this airline"
I was pleasantly surprised with this “budget” airline. Flying from Toronto to Phoenix and back was a breeze at such an affordable price. The plane left on time (maybe delayed by a few minutes) but then arrived earlier than expected so it all came out in the wash. I was curious about trying Lynx as there are so many mixed reviews but the cost was enticing (even with having to pay for carry on bags and a seat it still cost less than any other direct flight). Granted that there is no power outlets, no wifi, no entertainment, no food/drink (aside from water) but the planes were super clean, flight attendants were great and the flight was smooth. I knew what I was getting into with the absence of certain amenities but the price definitely reflects that. What I was expecting was a dusty old rickety plane with terrible service and hours or days of delays. What I got was the polar opposite. I highly recommend this airline!

### "won't fly again with them"
Carry on and personal items on lynx air: You have to go to the counter to get them to approve your carry on and your personal item. If you don't do it (even if you have your boarding pass), they will make you check the size of your cabin luggage with their little size case thingy at the gate (when its too late). They will be strict and make you either pay for a carry on if your backpack is too big or, if your carry on is too big, you won't be able to fly because it will be to late to check in the baggage with the bigger ones. So, do come as early as possible as indicated in their emails and go to the counter. They are less strict when you come to the counter 1st. They didn't put my cabin luggage in the size checking thingy. Also, won't fly again with them. Delays, not confortable, very young crew, far from the gates at YUL, having to go to the counter is another waste of time for sure. Not worst saving money over time. They are not the worst but you have to be careful with their shallow rules and not be bothered by flying low cost and waking up early. Otherwise, we landed, the plane got from A to B. So the job is done.

### "Absolutely horrible"
Absolutely horrible from the gate to the arrival. 2.5 hour flight took 5 hours. Won’t let you use digital boarding pass on your phone. Then wouldn’t accept our paper printed one. Had to get back in line for an airport printed boarding pass.

### "a one way refund will be offered"
While waiting at the airport in Toronto received a phone call that my father passed away, was told by numerous Lynx Air representatives a one way refund will be offered, still waiting almost 2 months.

### "Overall we had a good experience"
My daughter and I had a great experience with Lynx Air. This is a budget airline… so if you don’t pay attention when booking your ticket, you will not be happy. You need to measure your luggage- they check every bag at the airport for size and will make you pay if too large. If you read your emails and understand that there is no snack service, luggage restrictions, etc then your expectations will be appropriately set. Our flights left on time and very pleasant. Airplane staff was excellent as was check in staff in Toronto. Check in staff in Calgary were absolutely awful and miserable, but once you quickly got past them all was well. Airplane was very clean, warm, good bathrooms. Seats are very basic but ok for a domestic flight. Return flight was in an exit row and the leg room was great! You will pay for everything- but we were fully aware heading in to the flight and packed accordingly. We chose to pack together in one checked bag as that was cheaper than 2 carry-ons. No issues with our luggage. There is not a lot of staff in the airport and many seem to be in training, so do arrive early as advised in many emails sent before the trip. Overall we had a good experience and I would fly Lynx again.

### "Delay after delay"
Not Verified |  Absolutely horrendous. Delay after delay. No updates, and wrong information provided on their web site. This is the last time I am ever flying with this airline. They delayed our flight for 12 Hours. Then it went on for 24 Hours! Who knows if they will fly at all. Avoid this airline at all cost.

### "won't be traveling with them again"
I paid for a carry-on luggage but when I arrived at the airport, the lady at the check-in counter said because it did not fit into the metal frame, it has to be checked in. This is a carry-on luggage that I have been using for all my travels and it never has a problem. Besides, I can see other passengers bringing the luggage same size as mine onboard which made me feel so stupid that I followed the "rule" for them to measure my luggage even I already checked in online. But knowing Lynx is a cheap airline, I agreed to have it checked in and paid over $100 for that. The lady at the check in counter told me to call Lynx to get a refund for the fee I paid for my carry-on bag. When I called, I was told it will not be refunded according to policy. The lady at the call center put me on hold for over 40 mins then disconnected the line. I felt that it is so unfair for consumers to pay for a service that was never used, not to mention I paid extra for checking in the bag. It is not only about needing to compromise for small space and luggage fees, but also the harsh and unfair rules that Lynx impose. Now I learn my lesson and probably won't get into trouble again; however, I will not travel with them again. I rather pay a little more to save the hassle of lining up for over 40 mins even I checked in online so that they can measure my bags and to deal with the harsh rules and rude employees. Besides, even when I submit a formal feedback, the company refuses to take ownership for the wrong information given by their employee and all I got was a copy and paste reply. I value my good mood when I go on travel so I won't be traveling with them again. At least other airlines care more about their reputation and Lynx only want them be labelled as "The Cheapest".

### "do not recommend"
Not Verified |  Tight seats, no air flow, the cabin was sweating. Made the entire plane wait 15 min after landing because someone vaped in the bathroom, deal with them separately, don't make everyone wait. $140 charge for carry on, this airline is a joke, do not recommend.

### "Very much disappointed"
Take off time was 9 in morning crew said there is problem in engine and send us back to wait again. Boarding at 12:00 done, now time is 12:46 still in plane at Toronto airport no message from captain. They don't even offer a cup of coffee to passengers. First time in my life I saw this type of service from airline. I will never ever recommend to fly by Lynx Very much disappointed. Still waiting for takeoff

### "Overall good experience"
Family vacation Toronto to Orlando. Overall good experience. I will fly again. Flying Lynx (as well as other low cost carriers) is like riding the bus. Pay your fare, get on, expect zero service, get off. If you have that in mind, then Lynx is very good option. If you want service, snacks, reclining seats, video screens, charge port, book another airline. You get what you pay for. Everything is extra. Pay for your seat, pay for luggage. They really stick to the size of the personal luggage, so pack lite or just pay for carry-on, and have a stress free trip. It's still cheaper than major airlines. Although the actual check in process was about 30-45 mins, give yourself 2.5 hrs time. It took 45 minutes to check-in, due to 2 sets of people arguing that their personal item (clearly oversized) was personal and should not pay carry-on fee. Time spent was not the airlines fault, but peoples unrealistic expectations of a low cost carrier. Keep going Lynx. I'm tired of paying high prices with other carriers

### Lynx Air customer review
Beware of Lynx Air: A Cautionary Tale of Incompetence and Frustration. Our recent experience with Lynx Air, from Toronto to Los Angeles, was nothing short of a nightmare. Our return flight was abruptly cancelled while waiting in the check-in line and rescheduled without proper notice, attributed to 'IT technical issues'. When we sought recourse through an APPR complaint, we were met with a shocking denial and a claim that the flight wasn't delayed—an alarming display of disorganization and misinformation. To add insult to injury, we received damaged luggage, and our subsequent complaint has been pending with no resolution from Lynx Air. This experience wasn't just poor customer service; it was a complete failure of their system. If low cost is your only criterion and you're willing to gamble with your travel plans and customer care, Lynx Air might be an option. For those seeking reliability and respect, look elsewhere.

### "Terrible experience"
Not Verified |  Terrible experience. Arrived at destination 1:30 late both flight. YUL-LAS is way to long of a flight to be stuck in a such a plane. Usually, airlines will fly faster to make up for the delay and try to arrive at the schedule time. Not Lynx, they value saving gas over not arriving 1:30 hour late. Staff was very anal about the size of the carry on and was trying to force people to pay for a check bag on top of the fees they already paid for the carry-on. We got at destination so late they made us unload by the back into a bus.

### “I definitely recommend them”
First time flying with them. We did our research beforehand. (my ticket was $34.07. I’m gonna research it!) no drinks or snacks…pay for carry on or checked luggage. Cheaper to pay for luggage before you get to the airport. I read hundreds of bad reviews. Why do people fly a no frills airline then complain about paying for a carry on bag? They tell you that before you book! They are strict about their bag sizing. You cannot bring a hockey bag and call it your personal item. They check! We paid $69 for our shared suitcase. Checked it at the airport fine, very friendly counter staff (and not just 1 or 2..there were 5-6 at least) boarding was easy..back of plane first, made perfect sense. All flight attendants were pleasant! Got to our seats..no TV or power plugs or internet. But they tell you that when you book, it shouldn’t be a surprise! Plane was nice and clean, normal amount of room, all was good. Halfway through flight..no drink or snack service. But once again they tell you that! I pulled out my own drink and snacks and all was good. Imagine needing to use the washroom with no drink carts in the way! Flight was good and on time. We fly every month using whichever airlines are the least expensive. I have my favourites and I’m thinking of adding Lynx to that list! People shouldn’t complain when they are made aware of everything before they book! All the negative reviews almost scared me off flying with them but I’m glad it didn’t! I definitely recommend them.

### "83$ for a single carry on bag"
I finished web check-in 24 hours prior to my departure and haven't received my boarding pass in email. I paid 83$ for a single carry on bag which is ridiculously expensive. On the first place why do you guys keep tickets cheap if you don't want to make us aware for expensive rate for single baggage. And additionally they even charged 32$ to me for 2 seat booking and my friend was not charged a single $ just because he received a boarding pass in his email. Really very very unhappy with this. Worst airline service till date.

### "never recommend this airline"
Horrible staff. Our flight was originally at 6PM and delayed to 9:35PM after two delays. Our bags got measured at the departure gate and charged 101 CAD while that's never been the case before. Were met with the rudest staff ever and told solely "if your bags don't have a tag, we won't let you in". Staff refused to put on the tags for our bags and slammed the tablet at our face after we paid for the checked baggage. When we explained that we had never experienced this before, were simply told "well this is Lynx". But 101 CAD for a checked bag, almost the same amount I paid for my checked bag for my international flights, for a low cost airline. Would never recommend this airline.

### "Lynx Air is a joke"
Not Verified |   Lynx Air is a joke. They pushed my flight back 24 hours, luckily it just added an extra day to my trip to Vegas so I was ok with it. When I got to the Airport in Vegas to come home, there's no lynx kiosk until a few hours before the flight so it's really confusing. Staff are seriously rude. Had to pay 58 bucks to carry my bag on, which is a bit ridiculous but that's the rule I guess. Flight was delayed an hour. Service was really poor from the ground staff, up in the air was fine. The flight was half empty, and they crammed people in the rows of three, while other rows were empty. At the departure gate. They make you line up to get a paper ticket, and then line up again to get on the flight. It was the weirdest thing. This is my third time flying with them, and to be honest none of the experiences were good. I get it's a budget airline, but every single flight is delayed by hours or even days.

### "a terrible experience"
My flight with Lynx from Vancouver to Calgary was delayed four times, with my arrival time ending up 20 hours delayed. Lynx must have become aware at some point on the initial day of travel that they would be unable to carry out the flight, and rather than cancelling the flight and rebooking passengers with another airline, or sending everyone home to come back the next day, they pushed back the flight time by increments of 2-4 hours until 11pm, then delayed again until 8am- meaning everyone left the airport for less than 7 hours. The morning flight was delayed AGAIN, and they had no staff at the check in counter to check anyone in- so we all got up at 6am to come to an airport where there were no staff from Lynx, an issue they surely knew about before 7:00 when the delay was issued. Overall a terrible experience and I will never fly with Lynx again.

### "never recommend anyone use them"
This was my first and last time flying Lynx. I have been flying for over thirty years, and this was by far the worst flight I have ever taken. It was delayed weeks before the actual trip, and then twice on the day of, only to leave 45 minutes later than the third delayed time. The seat comfort was a zero, and I am honestly appalled that affordable airfare now means the sacrifice of time-respect and comfortability. I am amazed this airline is still in business, I would never recommend anyone use them.

### "pleasantly surprised by their service"
On-time and friendly staff. I was a bit hesitant to book with them as they are a new airline, but they I was pleasantly surprised by their service. Will book with them again.

### "Terrible Experience with Lynx Air"
Terrible Experience with Lynx Air. I recently had the unfortunate experience of booking a flight with Lynx, and I must say it was by far the worst airline encounter I've ever had. From start to finish, the entire process was a nightmare. To begin with, my flight was abruptly canceled without any notification. Imagine my shock when I arrived at the airport, only to be informed that my flight had been canceled. Surprisingly, I hadn't received any email or text message alerting me to this change. The lack of communication was already a red flag. When I inquired about the next available flight, the Lynx representative provided misleading information, stating that I would be flying out the next day. However, this turned out to be a blatant lie, as the next flight was actually scheduled for two days later. Considering my tight schedule with only four days in Vancouver, losing two days was a significant inconvenience. Attempting to address the issue, I requested compensation for the trouble. Unfortunately, despite the airline assuring me that I should have received it by October, I am still awaiting any form of reimbursement as of August. To make matters worse, each time I contact their customer support, they seem clueless about the problem and offer no assistance. Their response time is excruciatingly slow, adding to the frustration. The level of unprofessionalism demonstrated by Lynx has left me contemplating legal action to rectify this situation. It is disheartening that a company can operate with such disregard for its customers. In the end, I decided not to fly with Lynx and opted for another airline to ensure I could arrive in Vancouver on time. My advice to anyone considering Lynx Airlines: proceed with caution. The lack of communication, misinformation, and inadequate customer support make this airline a risk not worth taking.

### "flight was 3 hours late"
Incoming flight already hours late. Was boarding and about to be scanned in when someone grabbed me to say that I needed a tag to verify that my personal item was not too big. It clearly was something that can fit under the seat but I still had to get the tag. I was far from the only one - I'd say close to every other person in line was pulled out to do this cursory performative task. Some were even scanned in and were pulled back. Needless to say chaos ensued, which further delayed departure. The fact that you need to do this in the first place is annoying, at minimum. Could they not have asked people to do this ahead of time? I stepped away to find food (which I was not expecting I'd need to given it was a red eye flight that was supposed to be leaving before 1am), but I was sitting by the gate for well over 2 hours combined between the time I arrived (what turned out to be) way way too early at the airport and leaving, and I did not hear such a request to get personal bags tagged at all. So of course we arrived way later than expected, and of course they did not have a ground crew ready so we were sitting idle on the tarmac for at least 15 minutes before somebody waking up to do their job to get us to the gate. The flight was 3 hours late, how did they not know to plan ahead for this? Other aspects of the flight were also not great (seat, friendliness, cleanliness) but not truly unique to Lynx I suppose, but their stupid personal bag tag policy and just obvious utter and complete inability to plan and organize and resulting chaos is something else. I guess the fact that they have zero food and beverage on board even for purchase is not great either, considering that pretty much everything at the airport was closed by the time they got their act together to get us out of there. Maybe reconsider that policy of not having any food or drinks on board if you're going to be an airline that just simply cannot stick to a schedule (I checked, the same flight out the day before was 5+ hours late, at least I wasn't that affected I suppose...)

### "most awful airline in Canada"
I have flown with Lynx Air with my family to travel to Calgary this summer, but I regret my decision to buy the air tickets to fly with Lynx Airline. It was probably the worst decision I ever made in my life so far. According to the experience that I had recently with Lynx Airs, I believe, Lynx Air is the most awful airline in Canada. Customer service is just terrible, especially the Ground check-in service is so horrible that I would never recommend this service to my family & friends. Ground service agents, including their Supervisor, are very rude to every passenger being checked in. The supervisor who introduced himself at the check-in point was extremely rude and harsh with the passengers. The boarding process and even the inflight services are extremely poor; Looks like no one really cares about the passengers on the flight. With such experiences, I have made up my mind to never plan a trip with this particular airline and I will not recommend anyone to fly with this airline.

### "We were pleasantly surprised"
I was honestly nervous about Lynx since I had seen the reviews online. We were pleasantly surprised. I’ve flown with them four times now. Flights were never more than 30 min late (which when leaving from Pearson is basically on time in my books). Staff was friendly, seats were comfortable with more leg room than most flights (I’m 5’10” so this matters to me) and the planes were clean. Yes, there’s no frills but I will gladly bring my own drinks and snacks on board if it gets me the same flight for half the price. I really hope that more people will give them a try as we desperately need more options for airlines in Canada.

### "Absolutely ridiculous"
Our flight boarded at 3:50pm. We waited like an hour on the aircraft. They then said there was a problem with the A/C and asked 4 rows of passengers to get off the plane. A few minutes later they had us all get off the plane. They gave us a $10 food voucher and asked us to stick around because the issue would be fixed in 2 hours. We were told it was just the A/C unit and that it would be annoying listening to it for the 1.5 hour flight. At 7pm they let us know that our flight would be delayed until 11pm and gave us another $10 food voucher. I informed the gate attendant that I needed to be in Calgary for an appointment in the morning and she said that 100% the flight would be leaving at 11pm Nov. 8th. All Lynx employees had to go to another flight, and told us they would be back for our boarding. At 11pm they had us line up to receive a hotel since our flight has been delayed again until 5:30 am. Meanwhile there was no updates to verify this. All the other flights to Calgary had left so I was otherwise stranded. By the time I got through the line to get my hotel, it was 12:30am. It was a 40 min ride to my hotel and I was informed that it would not be covered by the airline. Since I would have to leave back to the airport in a few hours I decided to stay the night at the airport. The flight was then delayed again until 8:30am and then 10:00 am, all for the A/C to be repaired. I didn't land in Calgary until 12:30pm Nov 9th. A 17 hr delay with no compensation. Absolutely ridiculous

### "My experience was extremely disappointing"
My experience with Lynx Air was extremely disappointing. The airline changed their schedule a total of five times, resulting in a significant delay in getting home. Instead of arriving at 4:30pm as originally planned, I didn't reach my destination until 2 am. To make matters worse, when we finally disembarked the plane, we were held in a corridor for over an hour with no communication or explanation. The doors were even closed, leaving us feeling trapped and helpless. This level of disregard for passengers is absolutely unacceptable. This was my first time flying with Lynx Air, and I can confidently say that I will never choose to fly with them again. I strongly advise everyone to spend a little more and opt for an airline that actually cares about their passengers.

### "deeply dissatisfied with Lynx Air"
I recently had the misfortune of wasting my time with Lynx Air, and my experience has left me seething with anger and frustration. I booked a flight with this airline, only to arrive at the airport and discover that they had unilaterally switched my flight without bothering to inform me. The lack of communication from Lynx Airlines is utterly inexcusable. I was left stranded at the airport, unaware that my travel plans had been thrown into disarray. This negligence forced me to scramble and spend additional money on a last-minute alternative flight, all because Lynx Airlines failed miserably in notifying their passengers of changes. It's mind-boggling that an airline could be so callous and indifferent to the inconvenience they cause their customers. This incident not only disrupted my schedule but also led to unnecessary financial strain. Lynx Airlines' complete disregard for customer satisfaction is both shocking and disappointing. I strongly caution anyone considering flying with Lynx Airlines to think twice. The lack of professionalism and basic courtesy displayed in this situation is indicative of a company that cares little for its customers. I am deeply dissatisfied with Lynx Air and will actively discourage others from subjecting themselves to the same level of incompetence and disrespect that I experienced. Save yourself the headache and just pay the extra to fly with another airline.

### "I would never recommend this airline"
Not Verified |  Lynx airlines is the worse airlines we ever flown. On Sunday Sep 24 23 we were suppose to fly from Vancouver to Toronto. Our flight number 115 was suppose to leave at approx. 11:30 PM. Our flight didn't leave until the next day Monday Sep 25 1:30 PM . That's 14 hours later. We didn't even get an email that the flight was delayed. We had to sleep on a bench in the airport. We couldn't get a hotel after 12 am, not unless we want to pay about $500 a night in the Vancouver area. And we would have to wait approx. six months to get your money back from the airline. We couldn't even get in contact with any Lynx staff. Apparently, we were told from a third party that the flight came from Toronto to Calgary and when they got to Vancouver the Pilots ran out of hours and they couldn't fly back to Toronto. As we know by law a pilot can only fly so many hours in a day. Yes this airline has great price. But like almost anything in life you get what you pay for. You better pay the extra $ on air Canada or West Jet at least you don't have to wait 14 hours for your flight. I would never recommend this airline.

### "would not reimburse my funds"
It started with me starting to check in to the wrong flight as i mistaken my 730pam flight for 730 am. Ticket agent made me pay for my oversized bag (golf Clubs) and proceeded to take my payment. After processing payment i was advised this was not my flight and would not reimburse my funds and to call Lynx air. After several attempts with hours on hold as well trying to chat to the robot i received a rude agent and informed it was my problem and no refunds. Did not want to hear my story and only told me i was wrong and following policy. I asked her if she could please explain why i was calling and every time my reasoning was different. Then informed me to call Toronto airport as they deal with baggage. After contacting Toronto airport i was informed it is Lynx that is responsible. Complete run around. At the end of the day it is about customer service and if for any reason they can explain my wrong doing i would accept it. But again the check in and customer service is the glue to success. How can they take payment for a bag when passenger is not on flight  transport Canada policy). How can they not refund for my payment when service was not rendered.

### "I was pleasantly surprised"
I was pleasantly surprised after reading a number of online reviews. While there is minimal available on board, they make sure to remind you about this 72 hours prior to boarding and also have reminders to charge devices and purchase food in the airport at the boarding gates. Check in and baggage retrieval at the Pearson (Toronto) end was incredibly smooth. It was a bit less smooth at the Phoenix airport, with the bags being delivered quite late after arrival and the check in desk not being open 3 hours before arrival (was waiting about 10 min). In the end, the plane was comfortable and the staff were lovely. They also provided water service, which was unexpected. It’s better than many other budget airlines I’ve flown.

### "close to 300$ CAD for our two checked bags"
My carry-on was ok from Montreal, but not from Vegas. Not any refund possible, they also told me today. We end-up paying close to 300$ CAD for our two checked bags one way back to Montreal with no refund possible.

### "Such a poor service"
This is my first experience with lynx. My first experience was horrible as i first faced an issue while getting my boarding pass and I contact the support and they told me that you can get your boarding pass in the airport. When i reached there i carry the same personal item bag and they told me to pay extra cause it wasn’t fitting in that bag check area. I had to pay 91$ extra for the 6kg which was in personal bag. Lastly when they boarded us we went inside the plane at the last moment they announced that they got an issue and we had to board again. This is my first experience and from today onwards I'll never ever try to travel with this airline. Such a poor service

### "the staff was very friendly"
Not Verified |  I flew from Fredericton to Calgary round trip, the flight was on time and the staff was very friendly. Take your own snack and drink on board. Looking forward to flying with them again next year.

### "changed flight schedule"
Not Verified | They changed flight schedule without notification. I need to go back on time for my work, so purchased another flight ticket to go back. I asked compensation for the expense, but they declined it. Lynx is the worst airline. I recommend not to use it if you don’t want disruption to your trip.

### "I was pleasantly surprised"
Great value, low price! I was a little skeptical but I was pleasantly surprised during my first flight with this extra low cost airline. No delays, pleasant and attentive staff and above all an unbeatable price! I would not hesitate for a moment to use Lynx Air again.

### "charming and experienced staff"
Not Verified |   I had such low expectations given the reviews that I was more than surprised. New plane, charming and experienced staff. You bring snacks, you travel light and download things because there is no wi-fi and honestly it’s perfect! There are no surprises, everything is clearly indicated on the site. We will take it back. Sérieusement j’avais tellement pas d’attente vu les avis que j’ai été plus que surprise. Avion neuf ,personnel charmant et experimenté. Tu t’apporter des collations tu voyages léger et télécharge des trucs car il n’y a pas de wi fi et sincèrement c’est parfait! Il n’y a aucune surprise tout est bel et bien infiqué sur le site. Nous le reprendrons

### "they would not refund me any money"
When I booked my friends and my tickets to travel to Calgary Las Vegas return tickets, I paid for the carry on as well two ways. When me and my friends left Calgary, we never had any issues with the allowed size. But on the way back, which is Las Vegas to Calgary, the check in lady in Las Vegas won’t allow me and one of my friend to bring the same carry on bags to the cabin. She wants us to checked it in and pay $76 . We told her that it wasn’t a problem when we left Calgary and her response was, we are not in Calgary. So we like it or not, our carry on has to be checked in. So I asked if Lynx what happens to the money that I already paid in advance and she said to call Lynx a for a refund. So after coming back, I contacted Lynx just to be told that the money that I paid upon booking is non refundable. I explained that I got double charged but I was told that they would not refund me any money as I already paid them. That’s absolutely outrageous.

### “was pleasantly surprised”
My flight was delayed a bit, but communication was good, flight was smooth. I wasn't on the return flight, but my friend said it left on time and landed early. It's a basic airline, based on these reviews, I had low expectations and was pleasantly surprised. The flight was 25% the cost of a comparable Air Canada flight, I would book with Lynx again.

### "an atrocious airline"
Not Verified | Lynx is an atrocious airline. The flight I was supposed to get on was delayed 5 times for a total of about 11 hours. Some people lost entire vacation days because of their terrible planning. In the end, I think they gave each of us 10 bucks for airport for so we didn't perish. Do not recommend!

### "Great for the price"
Great for the price. Boarding was quick with a full plane, on time, arrived early. Basic features, no electric outlet, no foot bar, very narrow seats, regular leg room. No food service and just warm water offered. They don’t fuss with baggage sizes to an inch like others do.

### "the most terrible experience"
Not Verified |  I have the most terrible experience with them. My flight not only was delayed but they canceled it. I had to buy a last minute flight which cost me around 800 dollars. Their lack of customer service and contingency plans when things get complicated cost me more than paying a more expensive flight since the beginning. I'm not travelling with them again.

### "looking forward to being frequent fliers"
This was our first return trip on Lynx Air and it just was unbelievable. We knew that it was a no frill airline so did not expect much but were pleasantly surprised. The check in at Toronto in September was smooth and the flight though took off 40 minutes late was very comfortable. Though landing at Bradley West terminal and then to take a coach to Terminal 1 was a bit unusual. On our return trip it was just flawless! The check-in was smooth and though the flight had more people than our previous flight it took off right on time. The seats were comfortable and the limited service was excellent. The plane looked and felt new and fresh with the cabin staff friendly and smiling. The flight has no frills and that is what one can expect considering how very reasonable the fares are. In fact they are the cheapest! We sure are looking forward to being frequent fliers on this airline if they maintain the service and the pricing.

### "Not flying this airline again"
A group of us were scheduled to depart from Calgary to Las Vegas at 8:10am. We boarded the plane and everything seemed great - we even got out to the tarmac but then stopped short of the runway and turned around. The pilot came on to say they had a malfunctioning de-icer and had to get it checked out by maintenance at the gate. At the gate we remained on the plan for about a half hour when the pilot then explained they would either be fixing it or replacing it and that we'd have to get off the plane - but it shouldn't take more than an hour. We waited an hour which turned into another hour, followed by 6 departure time changes/delays before eventually cancelling the flight. Through this the gate agents would only say "we're working on it, it shouldn't be too much longer". At one point they even said "it's fixed, only 20 minutes then we'll board". Then we didn't because they cancelled the flight and told us the plane was fixed but leaving empty to make some other flight schedule. Though all this we got a $10 food voucher for our trouble. They did re-book our flights but to departing Calgary on Sunday only for us to return the same day which makes no sense. Gate agents told us we could take it or cancel for a refund so we did the latter. We then wasted another 3 hours in the airport on hold with customer service as there was a Friday morning flight with space on it but we weren't offered that. Customer service told us there was space on that plane but we'd have to pay the full fare to get on it as we cancelled! Completely ridiculous. The weekend getaway was ruined. Not flying this airline again.

### "Worst airline ever"
Worst airline ever! Domestic flight of three hours duration with a delay of eight hours! Short notice after arrival at the airport with no proper information about the further procedure. No vouchers offered for food and drinks to bridge the time. We were told it was a medical emergency which caused the delay, which seems convenient for them since they do need to refund or compensate if it's because of medical incidents. I doubt it causes 8 hrs delay though, since many other lynx flights went to Toronto. After the flight was delayed from 12:50 to 19:10 it was further delayed to 19:40 and then to 20:40 with no explanation at all. Ground service impolite and without pleasant answers. Whole day of vacation lost. Too much money spent on these tickets. Will never book again!

### "My return flight was canceled"
Terrible. Do not use Lynx. My return flight was canceled to be re-booked 3 days later. Leaving all alone with no where to go and did not help with hotel. There should be banned from doing business.

### "Worst airline ever"
Worst airline ever. Our 6:30 AM flight was canceled and we were rescheduled for 3:30 PM. Then we were rescheduled for 9:30 PM. Now we are rescheduled for 10 PM. We asked for food vouchers, but told we couldn’t have some because it was a “Medical emergency” that created the delay. Total lie. Never again!

### "Delay after delay after delay"
Horrific. Delay after delay after delay. Flight from Toronto to Halifax originally 7.50am. Arrived 3 hours before as told so at airport 5.00 am. 3. hour drive beforehand to Toronto. Soon as through security flight delayed to 3.15 pm. No food vouchers. No refund nothing. Now it’s due to leave 3.50 pm. Staff polite but unable to help. Just dial the number to Lynx. So currently at Toronto since 5am. Time now 1pm. 8 hours. No food vouchers so paid extortion rates to eat. Found a lounge for 2 hours at $65 each. Food included. Will we get to Halifax. Who knows.

### "charge me $83 extra for bag size"
I had 4kg in my bag, but they charge me $83 extra for bag size which only exceed by little bit. There was no communication made for the size. I feel they have cheaper tickets but they make money by doing such things like adding costs at the spot when there is no going back.

### "difference is not worth it"
Avoid flying with Lynx if you are looking for a reliable low-cost flight. Special bags purchased to fit on their “personal ítem” space were denied, so I needed to pay extra. A compact reflex camera hanging on my neck was considered an extra item as well, while handbags were not. It would be great to have known this in advance because in that case I would have bought any other rightly priced ticket from a different airline. The difference is not worth it. I hope they can learn to do it better in the future.

### "cancelled the flight with no notice"
They cost me over $700 because of unannounced delays, changes, and cancellations in my only attempt to travel with them. Not only was my flight delayed 6 times, over 3 days, without ever letting anyone know, but they also then cancelled the flight with no notice. They provided no assistance with stays, food, travel, other travel accomodations, or literally anything. They hung up every single customer support call anyone with a ticket started. And had no staff on the airport for 3 straight days. I paid over $700 out of pocket to feed and shelter myself, as well as travel to and from the airport because of the unexpected delays. The airline, after 3 weeks of silence, say that they are unable to refund anything because the cancellation was due to unscheduled maintenance, this is all the communication I have received from them.

### "agents were caring and efficient"
Not Verified |  My family had a medical emergency just as our Lynx flight was about to leave the gate and we had to deplane. When we were able to resume our trip the Customer Service agents were caring and efficient and got us on a flight the same day I contacted them.

### "incredibly disappointed with Lynx service"
Zero transparency. Original booking was October 3 in the afternoon. They initially rebooked my flight as they had cancelled it due to flight crew issues. New flight they offered was October 2 in the afternoon. They confirmed with me and I agreed. I suddenly get a check-in email saying I need to get ready for my morning  flight on October 2. They had switched my flight 9 hours earlier than what I agreed to and did not notify me at all. I had to speak to multiple agents (one of which suggested I can rebook my flight for $600) and finally got one to rebook my flight at their expense to October 4 early morning. It is October 4 and departure time has already passed. I had to approach the desk to ask what was going on, and they said the flight would be delayed an hour as they were looking for a back-up pilot. It’s been 40 minutes since we were supposed to be in the air and they JUST announced the delay with the new departure time in the next 15 minutes. I am incredibly disappointed with Lynx service and the lack of transparency to their clients. I will not be flying with Lynx again after today.

### "absolutely no complaint"
Not Verified | I tried Lynx Air for the first time Sept 28th to fly from Vancouver to Montreal. I have absolutely no complaint about this airline as the cost of my ticket was incredibly well priced even once I paid for my seat. I did not require to pay for a suitcase or a carry-on as I travelled really light for this trip. It seems that a lot of the passenger were complaining not being aware of all the extra charges which is very clearly explained on the website when booking a ticket. There would have been no delay leaving except for the fact that all those passengers having to pay their extra fees were causing a delay to board the plane which was a real nonsense for the crew at the boarding gate. People need to pay attention to the details before they blame the staff for their own errors. My return flight was great! No delay.

### "very greedy on expensive luggage fees"
Not Verified |  Lynx Air became very greedy on expensive luggage fees. Lynx airline used to be kind forgiving about carry-on baggage fees, back in April 2023 and before. But recently in September 2023, they become ultra-stingy and try to charge as much fee as possible on the luggage fees. My family got charge $90 CAD (including tax) per "oversized" luggage per person per one-way flight, totalling about $450 CAD in extra carry-on luggage fees on top of the $300 base fare (for 3 people) for roundtrip flights between Toronto and Halifax. My family will likely never fly with Lynx airline ever again. It seems Lynx airline being bought out by the Big corporation Air Canada has made them extra greedy in charging fees, not worth flying with them anymore. Other than that, Lynx is your typical budget airline, with only free water offered once during each 3-hour flight, there are no included onboard entertainment nor wifi nor snacks nor flavored drinks.

### "Absolutely ridiculous"
Not Verified | Just reviewing this airline because they canceled the flight 5 hours before it was supposed to take off and rebooked me for 6 days later just due to manpower. Then I tried to contact them and figure out how I would get home and there was nobody to even talk to. Within 3 days. I was finally able to get a hold of them to cancel my flight that they had booked 6 days later. Then I asked for reimbursement and they gave me $125 even though my flight that I had to book to get back for work was just under $500. They told me that because I canceled my flight 3 days later and didn't wait for my 6-day flight that I was only entitled to 125. There was zero attempt on their behalf to call me and let me know what my options were. I reached out to them since and pretty much they've just told me sorry but not sorry. I'm never flying with them again and I will not stop it anything to spread bad news about them. I had one other flight booked in the future and one of the legs of the flight had already been canceled by them and rebooked for four more days later. I've never actually flown with this company but had two trips booked. Absolutely ridiculous.

### "Major cash grab scam"
Not Verified |  The baggage charges are outrageous. My ticket price was affordable at 100 but upon checking in they told me I had to check my carry on bag which was a standard carry on suitcase. At first was told it was going to be 80-100. I was then told it was going to be 140 because we were further back in the line of people checking in for the flight. Cost more to check a carry on bag than for the flight it self. Major cash grab scam. Will never use this airline again the ticket prices sound good but you end up paying double or more

### "extreme chaos and clueless team"
Terrible airline, slow offboarding and onboarding, crews are clueless. Offboarded a flight due to a failed beacon lights and got delayed for 14 hours. Airline played the game and waited until 3AM in the morning to check in hotels, needs to check in 8am in the morning for the recovery flight. They are slow solving issues, extreme chaos and clueless team.

### "pushing for charging us at least one bag"
It was a surprise when I realize the size for personal Items was different to what is standard worldwide. I was flying with my wife, mother in law and 2 kids, and the experience at the airport was a surprise. It was like it was a bad joke in a hidden camera. The counter attendant was pushing for charging us at least one bag even when all of us had standard size back packs. That beginning of our vacations was really stressful. Then the flight was delayed in one hr.

### "doesn't want to give a refund"
I booked a roundtrip flight from Toronto to Calgary without checked bag or carry on. A personal item is allowed to be brough if it fits the front seat in the plane. The way to Calgary was fine, the way back was not. The supervisor at the counter wanted to charge me $150 for my personal bag that is a school bag with a laptop and couple of shirts that fit perfectly in the 'personal item' box near the counter. $150 is double than what I paid for the flight ticket itself. Somebody need to sue this airline for that as many people in the lineup were upset as you can't fit anything in this box, and my bag actually fit well there. After agreeing to pay the extra $150 so I won't miss the flight in a hope to get refund later on when I dispute this charge and complain to the airline, the supervisor decided to deny me from the flight and called the police (for taking pictures in public airport?) and I lost thousands of dollars in booking another airline to go back home, hotel fee, taxi, loss of work etc. There is nobody to talk to, customer service of Lynx doesn't function, they don't have any authority other then giving $50 discount for next booking a flight with Lynx. The supervisor didn't want to give her name or id number (even though she carried an id). This is a scam, many people on the line were upset as their bags didn't fit the personal item box which is extremely small, I fly many flights and always carry this bag with no issues. The crew was rude to me and discriminating me. This is unreal. The airline doesn't want to give a refund even. Worst airline ever

### "very poor customer service"
Flight was supposed to be at 7.30am, then pushed to 11.30am then pushed to 14.30pm then pushed to 17.30pm then cancelled. I did not get any compensation or money back from this airline which is very poor customer service. I will never as well as my family and friends fly with this airline again and recommend not to go with this poor and un-reliable airline.

### "Great for short distance flights"
Good airline, no delays. If you have the correct expectations, every service provider can actually be great! This is no different with Lynx. Our flights were on time, staff was courteous and smiling and as you likely already know prices are very competitive. We flew to Las Vegas for our 10-year wedding anniversary and have absolutely no complaints! This was our first time flying Lynx. I have to say we were a little bit skeptical about their baggage policy, but they are great at communicating their limitations/expectations up front and provided all the baggage measurements and prices in a detailed email 72 hours prior to departure. IMPORTANT: Do read and understand the email they send you... "Subject: Important information about your upcoming flight. If you follow the instructions, everything will be a breeze! Also, make sure you pay your baggage fees online, because they are more expensive at the counter. Do your research, pack accordingly and be prepared. If you do not want to pay for seat assignments or check-in online, leave them unselected and have the agent randomly assign you a seat at the check-in counter. No food or drink for purchase in flight (they do bring you water); there are no screens or in flight entertainment and also no plugins to charge your device(s); seats do not recline. Great for short distance flights! We are already planning our next trip and just found our new favourite airline.

### "discount airline good until you need help"
Horrible! Their site is useless so I had to call customer service. Twice. The first time I waited for 1.5 hours to speak to someone who could not help me. They seated my daughter and I far apart and when I called to get us seated together--23 hours before the flight when I was checking in--they could not change any seats, even if I paid additional to seat us together. As is typical, a discount airline sounds good until you need help. I should add that in the end, for just bags and fight, no seat selection, I paid over $500 to fly Vancouver to Toronto--which is no deal.

### "the whole baggage fees are a scam"
Baggage practices bordering on illegal, non-existent service, dirty planes, poor gate-to-gate performance. The airline attendants at the gate promised me that they would upgrade my bags, but that the upgrade would be the full price and I would later get a partial refund from the customer service. Surprise, the whole baggage fees are a scam, and customer service will adamantly deny that you upgraded one bag, and will insist you've bought multiple, because their records show you brought multiple bags, and you have no way of denying their records.

### "no service, no courtesy, no food, no water"
Lynx is an airline where they really do nothing except for A to B. There is no service, no courtesy, no food, no water, no ventilation (fans) and no sleep. For example, on. A red eye flight, they departed an hour late, and kept light on most of the night. For people looking to be tortured, it's a great flight.

### "charged 94 dollars for my bag"
Totally a rip off, they even charged for the backpack. I was charged 94 dollars for my bag. They told me that you cannot fly if you don't pay. They make excuses if you dont pay. very bad service ..

### "a great experience"
Not Verified | I flew from Calgary to Fredericton on September 13 and returned September 20. It was a great experience, staff were so friendly and it was obvious they loved their job. The aircraft was comfortable and immaculately cleaned. The price was very reasonable. My next trip planned is Calgary to LAX return in November and I will definitely pick Lynx.

### "it means that the agent lied to me"
Lynx Air is the worst flight I have ever seen during my flights. The flight crews were the most unprofessional and the most impolite crews I have ever seen. Lynx inflight crew damaged my luggage when she was trying to open further space for other luggage. As soon as the flight landed in LA (LAX), I showed the damaged luggage to the Lynx crew agent in LAX airport and she said that she filled a form on my behalf on her iPad and said to me that someone from Lynx will contact me in 5 business days. Nobody has never contacted me from Lynx in the next 5 business days. Not only Lynx is using 7 days delay as an excuse to avoid of paying the damaged luggage, but also it means that the agent lied to me, and she has not filled any form on my behalf.

### "I would absolutely fly with Lynx again"
I’ve never flown with Lynx before, not that I would consider myself a frequent flyer but I didn’t know what to expect. I was returning from a trip to Halifax with my Mother and Best Friend. The ticket prices were very reasonable. You do have to pay extra for luggage and to choose your seat. Fair enough, we choose to pay to pick our seats and for one checked bag and one carry on to share between the 3 of us. Once all the extra costs were calculated the tickets were still a good deal. We couldn’t fly out of Halifax on Saturday September 16th because of hurricane Lee. I expected our flight would be cancelled and we would be left to figure things out for ourselves. I was pleasantly surprised that Lynx delayed our flight and pushed it back to the exact same time on Sunday. We still had our chosen seats. The people who checked us in were pleasant and made the process easy. The flight crew were excellent, they were charming and helpful. I’m a bigger person and I found the seats to be comfortable and reasonably spacious. We were even offered complementary water mid flight. After going in with zero expectations, I would absolutely fly with Lynx again. I think they are an excellent option for people looking to fly at a fair price if you are willing to forgo all the fancy upgrades.

### "never been so angry at an airline"
Not Verified |  I’ve never been so angry at an airline. I’ve flown with my baby about 6 times now in the span of his 10 months. I’ve flown many airlines and not once have I had to pay to check a car seat. However, at Lynx they charged me 112$ one way to check a carseat. I could buy a car seat for cheaper than what I had to check mine for. I’m so angry at this airline for the poor quality, awful customer service, and dishonest pricing. My flight ended up being more expensive than air Canada’s would’ve been - and they give you a free checked bag, personal item, and carry-on. I’ll never fly with you again. Absolutely furious.

### "don't waste your time with Lynx"
Not Verified |  They canceled my flight the day before with no options of another flight. Due to the limited time that I had, it ended up costing me $4000 extra to book another flight. Just don't waste your time with Lynx

### "Garbage service"
Garbage service. Asked for $100 plus extra for same bag I bought with me when I came from Winnipeg to Toronto. Will never ever fly with them.

### "They care little for passengers issues"
Not Verified |  Explore all other options before booking with Lynx Air. I checked a suitcase during pre boarding. Cost was $69 Cdn. I was charged $69 USD and ended up paying $109 CDN for 1 checked piece of luggage. They refused to give me the difference saying optional fees are non refundable. They care little for their passengers issues.

### "they don’t care about you"
Not Verified |  Worst airline I have ever been on, all they care about is getting more money out of you. I had to throw out a bunch of stuff so that my backpack would fit their restrictive limitations otherwise I would pay extra. It’s a backpack, it will be the same size regardless, it will fit under the seat, you are just greedy. I have never NEVER seen an airline charge extra for handbag. Basically the airline sucks, the staff sucks, and they don’t care about you! Fly on any other airline besides this one.

### "Worst airline ever"
Worst airline ever. I have traveled with over 20 different airlines, and this one is the worst. They even charge you for handbags which I have never seen with any other 20 airlines and over 100 flights that I have had. They charge me C$90 for a handbag. outrageous

### "unpleasant and unprofessional"
The flight from Montreal is a gate 21. You must go through a tunnel under the tarmac to get there. It was 21:33, which was 2 minutes before the boarding start. The announcement started "final boarding... all customers must be on board". The gate close at 22:05, take off at 22:15. Everyone start running thinking we were missing our flight. That same announcement was played every 2 minutes. When i mentionned it to the  crew while scanning my ticket, he was literally blaming me to be late and if he didn't do that i would have missed my flight. The people in line were as shocked as me. It was only 7 minutes after boarding had start. Very unpleasant and unprofessional

### "Absolutely terrible customer service"
Fly at your own risk. Checked in online, but for an unknown reason, was not able to get my boarding pass. It says in the reservation confirmation that gate check-in will close 75 minutes prior to flight departures. Arrived 90 minutes before, and there is no one at the desk. Have them paged over the airport intercom, wait and wait, and no one shows up. Missed the flight and had to book another. Afterwards, contacted customer service and they say no refund, saying it's my fault for being late (which, again, I was not, per the language explicitly stated on the booking confirmation). Did manage to get on the return flight with no issues, and it's fine. Standard no-frills experience, worth it at the right cost. But their refusal to take responsibility for their error on the first flight means I will never use them again, and don't recommend anyone else does either. Absolutely terrible customer service, and not worth the risk. And, of course, ended up costing me more in the end.

### "They are charging for hand bags"
They are charging for hand bags. Total waste of money, even staff has no customer dealing skills. They are charging for each and every person by saying this not completely fit in box.

### "Will use this airline again"
When you purchase your ticket it clearly asks about luggage and states it is more expensive to purchase at the counter vs pre-purchase. Staff was very friendly and professional. The planes are new and clean. Water was provided, seats reclined, and the air buttons all worked. Will use this airline again.

### "what a horrible experience"
Not Verified |  Horrible airline. You pay half price but end up paying in pain, stress, fatigue, frustration for the other half. First of all two weeks prior to our flight we received an email that our flight is cancelled, after 2 hours on the line to speak to an agent they told us our flight is not cancelled and they had no explanation about the email! On the day of our flight from LA to Toronto, the flight was delayed 10 hours! Instead of arriving at 6:30 pm we landed at 4 am, we where told our luggage are at carousel 11 after waiting 40 minutes one of the other passengers noticed the carousel has been changed. There were no announcements or updates from the airline, 100+ passengers tired from a delayed flight were all waiting by carousel 11! On the way back we arrive 2 hours before boarding, the agent at luggage check told us the gates are closed!! We should have been here 3 hours before the flight. There were at least 20 people in line trying to check in their already paid for luggage. All these are the main points that stood out but oh my what a horrible experience! Never ever again!

### "avoid this airline at all costs"
Not Verified |  Terrible airline all around. From not keeping people updated of delays prior to arriving at the airport, cash grab by charging for personal items that fit well within the sizing device, no announcements keeping passengers at the gate updated of the new departure time and no refreshments or vouchers provided, rude check-in and gate staff, crabby and plain discourteous flight attendants. Lack of arrivals and baggage assistance staff on arrival - you name it this airline has failed miserably in pretty much every category of service delivery. I had a horrible experience flying them earlier this year and decided to give them another chance and I regret doing so. Never again. Take my advice and the words of most other travelers here and avoid this airline at all costs!

### "Highly recommend"
When things go right we have to say it. On-time departure nice flight, on the way back on time once again. This is a no-frills airline, with no food sold on board you are welcome to bring your own snacks or meals. Great cheap way to travel much cheaper for this direct flight than the other connecting flights. Highly recommend.

### "airline service was awesome"
This airline service was awesome. Boarding was start on time. And fly almost on time. The crew members were very polite and cooperative. We had stay at Winnipeg and after stay we fly on time. Its worth for us for every single dollar we spend. We will try next time when get chance.

### "Not worth the gamble"
Not Verified | Not worth the gamble. I booked a Lynx Air flight from YYC to PHX for Oct. 6, 2023. That flight has now been postponed by more than 24 hours due to "crew availability". Changing my travel plans by an entire day was not an option in this case, so I had to pay over $800 to find a flight with another airline. This company must be understaffed or poorly managed if they are unable to find a crew for a regularly scheduled flight. 3/10 because at least they provided me with a month's notice to find another flight (even though they should have used that month to put a crew together and honour the flight schedule). And the refund process was easy. Seat comfort and cabin staff not rated since they didn't actually get me onto a plane.

### "you need to pay for backpack"
When i reach the airport the lady at counter said you need to pay for backpack which i have on my shoulders. I told them this bag is allowed without any cost and i travelled many times with this airline and why do I need to pay approximate $83 for back pack. She said either pay for bag or i am not giving you boarding. On that time i left my bag at airport with my brother and fly away without anything.

### "$83.99 carry-on fee for our small backpacks"
Not Verified |  Boarded at 7:40 AM; Take off was supposed to be at 8:30 AM. We boarded and remained sitting on the tarmac until 9:50. Finally, the pilot communicated that he was missing his Log Book for the plane so we weren’t able to take off without it. We were told in increments of 10-15 mins until 10:30 that this was a maintenance issue and there was nothing anyone could do for us to take off without the physical Log Book. We were now sitting here waiting for the Maintenance Crew to show up with the Log Book. At 10:30, the pilot announced anyone who wanted to get off the plane can do so (but to bring all of their personal and carry-on items off the plane). At 10:50, the pilot then announced he could not hold anyone against their will and keep them on the plane. Everyone was instructed to un-board the plane and wait at the departure gate. There was no announcement on if the flight was delayed or cancelled! Everyone sat in confusion and frustration. Finally 13:15 came around and we were told it was a delay and we can now start to re-board onto the plane. This was over 4.5 hours of waiting at YYC! As we were boarding, the concierge handed everyone $10 paper vouchers to use at the airport within 24 hrs. To our dismay, this was adding salt to the wound! During the 4.5 hours of waiting at the departure gate, my partner took the liberty to complain about the $83.99 carry-on fee for our small backpacks that tucked comfortably under the seats in front of us. We were stuck at the airport without any communication or updates on flight status until they announced they were re-boarding us 4.5 hrs later. Just when we thought our flight home would maybe be smoother than going to Toronto. Our boarding time was 19:25 but they didn’t board us until 20:05 (this was the departure time). Our arrival time to Calgary was slated to be 22:34. It is now 00:22 and we are now stuck at the Winnipeg airport because the pilot indicated an indicator light went off and they had to land in Winnipeg to check out the issue. We are now sitting at the gates (once again) with no updates and we are no longer surprised. We were told by the gate concierge to not to leave the gated area otherwise we cannot come back to board the plane. Tim Hortons is in sight but we can’t head downstairs to grab food. 00:23: the flight (Y9108) is now cancelled and we were told to go upstairs to the ticketing counter to get information on where we would be accommodating. Everyone from that flight was in the line-up. No Lynx staff was in sight! Lynx staff finally arrived 1.5 hrs later and proceeded to process everyone in line for assigned hotel accommodations until they can get the plane back up and running. They indicated to come back to the airport around noon the next day and to frequently check our emails. Surprise, no emails came through from Lynx whatsoever! We proceeded to check the Winnipeg Airport Association (WAA) website and that was where we were able to find our flight status!

### "Expect nothing when flying with them"
I flew with Lynx Air for the first time and also will be my last. The customer service representatives are rude and there is no one on airport to assist and answer your questions. We have to move between multiple carousel to find our luggage and after waiting for 90 mins we ended up loosing our bag. Nobody was willing to help from Lynx Air with no luggage assistance team anywhere near the carousel. Upon inquiring about the lost luggage at their check in counters at Pearson airport, we were told to go somewhere else and that they do not look after lost baggage requests. On top of that they are very rude and won't even look at you to answer. Pathetic customer service. Expect nothing when flying with them or only plan to fly if you pack light or better pay more and have peace of mind.

### "No customer service"
First time flyer with this airline and will also be the last. Echoing so many of the other reviews.. No customer service - only access to a chatbot Staff at airports are rude, inflexible and lack professionalism. No staff to be seen at baggage carousels to assist or answer questions. Booking process is easy to manage, but add-on's are ridiculously expensive - they encourage you to make any changes 24 hours prior to check in but then do not allow you to be able to make those changes or reach a live person. The chatbot spews out pat responses that provide no help at all. You are forced to go to the check-in counter at the airport to make any changes where you are then charged a premium. The inflight crew were singularly unhelpful and did not communicate any issues or delays. Seating is paid for and costs are tiered, yet they then started to rearrange passengers with no consideration or compensation for the inconvenience. Then there was the baggage.....waited for almost 90 minutes to receive our bag and this after they changed the off loading carousel with no announcement to the passengers patiently waiting at the carousel they announced on the plane AND was showing on the monitors. Buyer beware. You end up paying FAR more than the actual ticket price. You will see delays and receive little to no communication. Pack your stuff into a pillow case and take it as a personal item to save yourself the additional baggage fees and ensure you have lots of entertainment downloaded to help pass the time. Having little to no expectations for your trip will help make the travel experience a bit more palatable.

### "how truly awful Lynx airline is"
Not Verified |  I cannot emphasize enough how truly awful Lynx airline is. My flight was delayed multiple times, causing me to stay at the airport for over 9 hours. There was little to no communication from staff members. When I finally was able to ask a staff member if my flight was going to be delayed again, the person I spoke with gave me an incredibly rude and vague response. I submitted an inquiry online via their chat to receive compensation for missing my first night stay and transportation. I was told I would receive a confirmation email with my case number; however, that never came. It is impossible to get a hold of anyone over the phone. I am truly grateful that my return flight is not with Lynx airlines.

### "Terrible customer service"
Not Verified |  Terrible customer service. The Luggage is lost. Their wait time on the phone was almost 2 hours and no help. Then I went to the online chat service and waited for 45 minutes there again no help. They even don't say what is the status of the bags. They just tell you that you will receive an email that you have a claim. 2 days and no email yet. Worst service I ever received from an airline.

### "made me pay again for checked bag"
I paid for checked luggage on booking. arrived at the airport and they made me pay again for checked bag $113.00 Apparently the bag paid for on booking was a carry on bag. It is the same cost for a carry on bag and a checked bag. $79.00 But they could not figure out how to make this transfer at the airport and insisted I paid for it again. Just hard to understand that they have such incompetent people handling their check in desk at the airport. So sad to see this in customer services.

### "fraudulent charges made to my credit card"
Multiple unauthorized fraudulent charges made to my credit card. No customer service at all. Multiple attempts made by phone, the hold time greater than one hour.

### "don’t recommend Lynx"
Not Verified | I don’t recommend Lynx to anyone they are complete rip off. When I reached the airport they overbooked the flight and don’t take me onboard. Some guys even come at 1 hour earlier at counter they also let them onboard. Please guys choose any other airline. I wonder how even they have 1 and half star ratings.

### "First and last time ever"
Not Verified | First and last time ever flying with this piece of garbage airline! Waited over an hour for baggage retrieval with not a single announcement or update - no customer service ANYWHERE, tried calling, email and chat with zero results. Return flight, Check-in Agent incredibly rude and inconsiderate. Just when you think things can't get any worse, they managed to surprise us with a new level of lowliness and the final cherry topping on top of two delays and gate changes from one end of terminal to another topped with an additional lengthy boarding delay.

### "Made a mistake booking this flight"
Not Verified |  Booked a flight 4 hours earlier so I can get to my international transfer at Vancouver to Melbourne but flight got delayed for 3 hours. Arrived late to Vancouver and from there missed my flight heading to Melbourne. Such pathetic flight with no other consideration. Will never recommend anyone else to book a flight with them. Made a mistake booking this flight.

### Lynx Air customer review
Terrible! Everything is extra, Baggage costs are almost as much as ticket price! 3 hours to get to phone help. 18th in line for chat. Chat cannot answer questions so terminates chat. Told there were no upcoming promotions but 3 came up within a week after booking. Website is a mess - triple booked me. No tsa/Nexus available on a Lynx flight. Got to be one of the the worst airlines ever. Wont make the mistake of using them again Hope you wont ever make that mistake.

### "horrible for my first experience flying"
First off the flight was cheap but carry on was not, I got a way cheaper flight with Air Canada when I flew back and my Carry on was free. So my flight was supposed to leave for 8.20 and arrive in Edmonton at 8.47 with the 2 hour difference, I didn't get in until after 1am. Also nothing but confusion at the gate, which was changed multiple times, Just horrible for my first experience flying.

### "is Lynx a good value? No"
In July I booked two tickets from Lynx and both experiences were horrible. One was delayed more than 3 hours (Vancouver to Calgary) and another flight (Calgary to Los Angeles) was delayed, then canceled, then 24 hours later, I received an email that they rescheduled me for a flight 48 hours later. By that time, I was already forced to stay an extra night and had purchased new tickets to go back home to Los Angeles. I had a young child traveling with me. Anyone who has traveled with young children will know how terrible it is to be stranded in an airport for hours indefinitely. These two flights ruined my vacation. And I have received zero compensation so far. Nothing for hotel, air fare, and not even a refund for the original flights I purchased that were canceled. You're welcome to read on for further details: My flight from Vancouver to Calgary was delayed more than 3 hours and I was notified around 3AM, just a few hours before the original departure time. It was annoying but we eventually got to Calgary. The flight from Calgary back home to Los Angeles, however, was an absolute nightmare. We got to the airport, went through customs to the US terminals, and was told it was delayed an hour around boarding time. Then we were told two more times it was delayed further, then "indefinitely" (but still not canceled). The Lynx employees (who said they didn't work for Lynx; just third party contractors who work for the airport) rounded up all the passengers and ushered us back through US/Canada customs and dumped us in the baggage area. To make a long story short, families with young children such as mine were stranded at the Calgary airport with no customer support whatsoever. I had to book a hotel, stay an extra night in Calgary, then scrambled to purchase a ticket back to Vancouver, then flew to Los Angeles from Vancouver because there were so few flights out of Calgary to Los Angeles. During all this time I have received zero communication from Lynx, nor could I reach any customer representatives. Then the next day, while we were already on our way back to Los Angeles, I received an email from Lynx showing that they rescheduled my flight to two days later. Impossible to believe that this is a real company. Maybe it isn't - who knows. After all, they only have four airplanes in the entire company, according to Wiki. Wish I had checked this website before booking. Lastly, is Lynx a good value? No, because I ended up paying $200 for an extra hotel night, then $1600 for our flights back home on Westjet and Air Canada and I was not refunded for the original Lynx tickets I purchased.

### "Worst customer service"
Not Verified |  Worst customer service. Very unorganized. Over 6 hours of delay on way to Montreal. My return from Toronto also had delay. They mention staffing as the reason.

### "insisting me to pay for baggage"
I booked my ticket via kiwi.com and the information i was given about baggage was incorrect by kiwi.com. Staff who were checking in for flight were rude and they were not ready to listen to me and insisting me to pay for baggage.

### "negative emotions and a spoiled vacation"
I had 2 flights of this airline. I regretted it twice. the delay was more than 3 hours. I arrived very late because of which I had to take a taxi and also pay for late check-in. The airline company refuses to compensate for the damage. There were also a lot of problems with the flight delay on the return flight. Rudeness at the reception. They didn't want to register me and another woman with a child. Just a terrible aviation company, I do not advise using it. The most negative emotions and a spoiled vacation

### "overall a good service"
Went in skeptic after reading other reviews, but it turned out to be a smooth ride. No problems with carry ons, flight was on-time, staff were super friendly, overall a good service. For a budget airline it's a great service, I'm mostly writing this review because they deserve it. I saw some bad reviews and was nervous about my flight and baggage (I'm traveling on a slim budget) and I had no issues. Thanks Lynx Airlines and keep up the good work!

### "Lynx has completely abandoned us"
I flew to St. John's Newfoundland from Montreal on August 3, 2023 with Lynx Air to join my father who had taken the same flight on August 1, so that we could visit my grandmother. My boyfriend arrived Thursday evening (August 10) and we have to return to Montreal together on August 14 to return to work. Two hours after we picked him up, Lynx Airlines sent us an email saying that our flights back to Montreal are only two weeks away, and that no accommodations will be offered while we're stuck away from Montreal, no help with meals. They say my boyfriend and I can't get home until August 28th and my dad has to get home on the 30th. We had to book a brand new ticket home with PAL airlines to bring us home, and hope to get refunded by Lynx. The Canadian Transportation Agency said it was an organization after the fact and to make a complaint as soon as we return and to keep our invoices. It is impossible that the company was not aware! Lynx is advertising cheap flights all the way from Calgary to St. John’s, but not completing the service agreement with them. Lynx has completely abandoned us.

### "they treated me very badly"
Not Verified |  I boarded from Toronto to Winnipeg via Lynx Air. My daughter forgot her backpack in a waiting room, they treated me very badly when I requested to check my bag. I was with 3 kids, they didn’t allowed me to see the waiting room. I was in a bus before going to plane when I requested them, but they refused.

### "Worst experience of my life"
Not Verified |  When we tried to check in online we couldn't so we went to the airport to check in. That's when I found out that my flight was cancelled. There was no information or email that was sent informing me of the change. When I went to talk to the Lynx representative they simply said there was no flight going to Edmonton that day and I had to go that day because I had to attend a funeral and had to return the next day. I showed them my booking confirmation email and tried to explain to them the situation but they just said that this was the fault of the agency and refused to take responsibility for not sending an email in advance and letting me know or acknowledging their faults and giving me compensation. When I called the agency, as expected, they said it isn't their fault because they also didn't receive an email from lynx so they were unable to let me know. After that, I tried to call lynx on the phone to see if they could do anything. I ended up waiting for 2 hours and not a single person picked up the phone. It just kept telling me all the representatives are busy and to wait longer. I ended up missing the funeral of a dear friend because of some irresponsible airline. I would strongly discourage anyone who is thinking of flying Lynx. Worst experience of my life.

### "charged for normal carry on luggage"
Not Verified |  First they charged for normal carry on luggage, the staff was cold and unimpressive. They force you to put your personal items under your seat even if there is space on the overhead bins. They managed to ruin our trip to Jasper and Banff by their unprofessional behaviour. They should be penalized and fined.

### "get you there eventually and cheaply"
Lynx do get you there eventually and cheaply. Anything else is a bonus. Booking and organising are pretty straightforward, look out for the email reminding you to check in online. There is no app or anything else and boarding passes will be emailed to you and your party direct. Choosing - and paying for - Priority Boarding doesn't seem to make any difference as Priority Boarding will not be printed on your boarding pass or called at the Gate. It may however give you the confidence to push to the front. When considering bags do bear in mind that at no stage will how many bags you are carrying be reconciled with how many you have paid for so you may wish to style it out on this one. Lynx don't fly on time. They fly the same day but otherwise everything is quite fluid. Do sign up with the airport you are flying from for texts on the flight to keep in touch as Lynx will only update you over email. Keep an eye on both. The 2-3 hour delays on our outbound and return were both blamed on late incoming aircraft - the outbound kept worsening, the return was declared late the day before and stuck to this time. Boarding is chaotic and disorganised, basically you need sharp elbows if you wish to get on first. The Lynx fleet is modern, comfortable and clean. There are no in flight amenities which they are very clear about - water will be served regularly but no wifi, entertainment or food so bring your own. There is also no power at seat so again your power bank is your friend. Cabin crew are friendly and competent. Boarding at Pearson is via bus and seems to depart from a car park some distance from the airport, be prepared accordingly. It is cheap. It will get you there. Stop expecting anything else and don't make any plans linked to landing at a given time. Its not Emirates first class people, calm down.

### "delayed and delayed and delayed"
Leaving Toronto flight on July was delayed a couple of times. Flight was scheduled at 7 am so we prepared to leave home by 3 am only to find out flight was delayed and delayed and delayed and delayed. Finally we boarded the plane and waited again because apparently no co-pilot. We finally took off around 11 am (by this time, we don’t care anymore). Hoping a bit better leaving St. John’s and same issue happened. Originally scheduled at 6.10 pm and delayed and delayed and delayed. Then it was overbooked and they need volunteer to give up their seats with some compensation (credited). finally boarded plane around 8 pm but plane didn’t take off until 9.15pm due to maintenance issue. They found scratch on the rotor of the plane. We arrived in Toronto at 11.08 pm and right now it’s 12.30 am Toronto time and we are still waiting for our luggage. Carousel is not even moving. Very hard to travel with pet and little child. This is our first and for sure would be our last! Giving it 1 star because at least we arrived in Toronto.

### "original flight was at short notice cancelled"
Not Verified |  The original flight was at short notice cancelled. Phone centre not reachable. I had to fly 15 h earlier at a very inconvenient time over night. Seats cannot be lowered. Long wait for baggage.

### "No updates and no information"
If you are prepared for a guaranteed late departure, use this airline. My flight was delayed for three (3) hours when going from Toronto to Calgary and one hour delayed when coming back from Calgary to Toronto—no valid reasons for the delay. No updates and no information. Terrible customer service. There is no one you can talk to. You can call their customer support, but either the number will be busy or no one will pick up the phone. The most horrible flight I ever flew with. I wish I could give zero rating.

### "I should have listened to the reviews"
You are guaranteed to have a terrible flight. I should have listened to the reviews that I had read, I booked the flight as the time worked out perfectly for me, I was willing to pay more with other airlines for my peace of mind. But I went with Lynx due to my time being more valuable to me...big mistake. I booked even being concerned that they would lose my luggage due to reading reviews. I bought an air tag to track it and thought I would be fully prepared. I was wrong. I was solo travelling in Canada as a young woman, and expecting to get my flight at 11.10 to arrive in Toronto for around 4pm giving me an evening exploring on my trip. However this flight was delayed to a new time of 3.00 given the reason of staffing issues (meaning I would be entitled to compensation as per their website and the regulations of a 3-4 hour delay) then it was delayed to 8.50pm this meant I would miss check in where I was staying and would be stranded at 4am in Toronto because of Lynx as a solo traveller this was terrifying. I could not once get a hold of Lynx, no help was given at all. The flight departed at 10pm in the end and I missed my whole day in Toronto arriving at 5.32am. As the rest of these delays were “safety issues” I was told online I could not be compensated...despite paying for a hotel night I never got to stay in and having a disgusting 11 hour delay. I tried to call Lynx on the day and couldn’t get through, left in the queue for 30 mins each time before it cut me off. And I did not want to spend the rest of my trip calling them, and am now unable to call them now I am back in the UK due to international call fees (especially as I’m sure I’d be left in the queue and I’d be paying for silence) The rest of the passengers being Canadian citizens managed to contact Lynx and were advised of a $500 compensation.. whilst I received nothing. Lynx are absolutely disgusting and deliberately denying my compensation due as I am not a Canadian citizen and so they are aware I cannot call, and only send emails. I would advise against this discriminatory service at all costs! Never ever again!

### "they surcharge for everything"
Not Verified |  Don't get enticed by lower prices, they surcharge for everything. And you have to account for your valuable time. Nothing but delays and misinformation or no information. I tried to get info about why we were delayed for hours and the airlines person said he didn't have to say anything other than the plane is delayed. I referred him to the APPR and he claimed to never have heard of it? Wow. And when I pulled it up to show him he went back to talk to someone and then came back and said call customer service. Or course you can't get through to them. They treat you like cattle. If you can avoid airline travel do so, but if you must fly avoid Lynx.

### "Terrible service from Lynx Air"
Terrible service from Lynx Air. Flight was delayed 3 times due to different reasons each time, then cancelled on the 4th Delay announcement. Replacement flight wasn't for another 13hrs, no support or assistance was given to impacted customers either. They are now trying to make an excuse that the flight was cancelled due to Maintenance for Safety, despite it being delayed due to 3 different types of reasons beforehand, this is all a ploy to just cover themselves so they don't have to pay out compensation to the affected customers. I was a first time flyer with Lynx, I didn't even make it to the Tarmac, I will not be flying with them again and I advise others to avoid them like the plague due to their terrible services both Online and Physical.

### "a complete disaster"
Not Verified | Lynx Air, congratulations on providing us with an unforgettable experience – and by unforgettable, I mean a complete disaster. Canceling our flight and leaving us stranded in Las Vegas for two days was just the beginning of their impressive show of incompetence. Bonus points for not batting an eye at the hotel expenses we incurred during the ordeal.

### "customer service is non-existent"
Not Verified | 1) My "direct" included a surprise stopover in Toronto, adding another 90 minutes on the plane (which we were not allowed to leave while on the ground). 2) Customer service is non-existent, gave up waiting on hold after 2 hours. Seriously, any company that doesn't offer a call back option these days is doing so intentionally which shows how much they value their customers.

### "sell tickets when the flight is fully booked"
Not Verified | The worst airline in my life. They sell tickets even when the flight is fully booked. They are scams. I could not fly on the 31st of July 2023 from Hamilton to Calgary because the airline claimed the flight was fully booked and they never refunded my money.

### "charge you for a back pack 111 dollars"
Not Verified |  They will charge you for a back pack 111 dollars, same to your carry on bag another 111 dollars. When you arrive at the airport your flight may be delayed for couple of hours. What a bad airline. People who are working for this Air Line I feel bad for them. People should think before they fly with Lynx Airline.

### "absolutely garbage"
This airline is comparable to Spirit airlines, absolutely garbage! Starting with check-in, it’s $100 for carry on, they’ll separate you from your family with seat assignments and blame it on the system generator. Flight was delayed. Then once on the plane, the captain announces further delayed due to the engine not working appropriately but “will get us off the ground shortly because we have a backup engine and once that’s all situated we can kick back in the good engine.” We’re also surrounded by other families who have had flight cancellations with this airline for a few days and apparently they’ll only reimburse you $200 a day for accommodations and food. Also when you’re waiting for take off in the flight, they turn off all ACs. So if you’re planning to fly with this airline just make sure you bring your own fan.

### "Don’t fly with these guys! Horrible quality"
Not Verified | I am LIVID. Me and my party of five, all purchased a carryon and a personal item. We arrive at Toronto Pearson Airport and as we’re trying to get our boarding passes, their printer stops working? Which is minor, but we were already late for our flight. We check our luggage and are going through boarding when their scanners stopped working. Really getting annoyed at this point, but not all travels are perfect. We finally board the flight and take off. The flight was fine, until we landed at 1:30 ish. By 6:45, no sign of 3 (mine, my mothers, and my aunts) suitcases. If it were for my mom constantly asking people what’s going on, we’d probably still be there waiting for our suitcases. Finally after 5-6 hours of waiting, the customs manager finally tell us that our suitcases are either stuck in the system, or still in Toronto. We had to leave for a cruise the next day, and three of us had nothing but our small backpacks and carry on items. I was looking forward to a relaxing vacation, but I get told “we have no damn clue on where your things are, and we don’t really care, we’ll throw some money at it and hope it goes away!” Don’t fly with these guys! Horrible quality!

### "no warning of the flight changes"
Not Verified | My parents wanted to visit me in BC from Ontario so I bought them round trip flights. Their return flight was supposed to be on Sunday July 30th at 11am as said on the confirmation itinerary. As I checked them in, their boarding passes said Saturday July 29th at 12:30pm. I checked the flight status for the 30th and it said it is canceled. We had no warning of the flight changes and had to purchase new last minute flights to get them back home. I have been trying to call them since Saturday (waited 5 hours on hold that day) and it’s Monday now, and again, still on hold.

### "I was denied a boarding pass"
Not Verified |  I was denied a boarding pass after paying for two way ticket and checking-in on-line because I was told that my USA PASSCARD was insufficient proof of USA Citizenship. The agents at the check in counter said that the USA PASSCARD was invalid for air transportation from Vancouver to Calgary despite my having already cleared Canadian Customs in Victoria BC 3 days prior after arriving by ferry from Seattle. The back of the USA PASSCARD states that it is only valid for ground and sea travel between USA and Canada internationally. The validity of my USA PASSCARD was verified within the hour by AIR CANADA agents in the same terminal.

### "don’t know if this is an airline or a sham"
Not Verified |  Really don’t know if this is an airline or a sham. In Toronto they take us to a terminal where all shops close at 9. The flight was supposed to take off at 8 and then every 30 mins they kept delaying until 1 am. No apologies, no care for elder and kids who have been waiting not even a bottle of water. Reason is even funny. They could not find a company to clean the aircraft, can you believe it. Please please please avoid this flight . And after reaching Calgary waiting for another 60 mins for baggage to come. Canadian airport authority should look into this for sure.

### "messes up my travel plan"
Flight delay from hour to hour, ending up to be from 9.30pm to over 2am. This messes up my travel plan, other than being extremely annoying. Also, on Google flights was signed as carry-on free. But I ended up paying for it.

### "worst management I've ever seen"
Not Verified | Simply the worst airline I’ve ever flew, delays, no comfort, explanation or caring whatsoever. I've used ultra cheap airlines before, but who runs this company is a joke worst management I've ever seen in my life.

### "Staff  rude and unaccommodating"
I do not recommend Lynx Air. Never in my years of plane travel have I been charged for a personal item backpack being too large. Lynx charged me $100 for a backpack that clearly fits under the seat, and has many times in the past. Staff was rude and unaccommodating and extra charges significantly increased my cost of travel. Also, no option for mobile boarding passes and airline communication is poor. Prices aren’t worth the headache. Won’t fly again.

### "The worst service ever"
The worst service ever. The flight was delayed and then it got cancelled and they didnt even book us another flight. They told us they would, they are very irresponsible

### "will never fly with Lynx Air again"
Our 7:30p flight was delayed until after 10:00p and there was absolutely zero communication about what was happening or when it would be resolved. My wife and I were traveling with two small kids (Ages 3 & 1) and when we asked for some more water so we could relieve the pressure on their ears, we were told "that it wasn't time for water service and we would have to check back later in the flight" naturally our kids were crying and despite numerous pleas to fill up our water cup, they would not allow us to have it. We eventually arrived after 1am (over 3 hours late) and they had the audacity to say "have a great night" as we stepped off the plane. I will never fly with Lynx Air again, even if they pay me to fly on their airplanes.

### "unorganized and poorly run"
Not Verified | I flew from Toronto to Orlando for a business trip I. July. When I first checked in the lady could not find the information in her system for my paid checked luggage receipt. I showed her my printed copy of the paid receipt to confirm and she wouldn’t initially accept it saying that it wasn’t in the system and tried to make me pay again. I had to basically call over a manager and argue and fight to get my bag checked. (The cost to check 1 bag was an extra $187 dollars) When I landed in Orlando my bag was lost and never arrived. There was a girl at the Orlando airport who was nice but wasn’t really able to help me a she was a subcontracted employee that didn’t work directly for Lynx. She took my baggage claim report and said someone would call. I spent 12 days in Orlando and my luggage never arrived. I had to re-buy everything for my trip. On the way back the flight was delayed by 3 hours which was annoying (but unfortunately more common these days) and we sat on the runway for about half hour waiting to get off the plane because there was a “miscommunication” with the agents that were suppose to meet us on the runway with the stairs to deplane. It was pretty frustrating. Overall the airline seemed pretty unorganized and poorly run. I’m hoping my luggage gets back to me at some point when I get home. I won’t be using this airline again.

### "No proper communication whatsoever"
Delayed 5 hours, then didn't take off for 1.5 more hours. No proper communication whatsoever. Ticket booking service wasn't informed about this delay, all calls to their customer support fail "due to technical reasons". Flight crew is extremely novice, logistics for Lynx flights is non existent. This is the worst airline operating in Canada by a substantial margin. Avoid at all costs

### "flight was delayed"
My flight from Calgary to Vancouver was delayed and no notification was sent so we were sitting by the gate more than 20 mins after boarding as no one has said anything. When I looked into the flight status screen it says cancelled. Supposed to leave at 9:30pm but was rescheduled for 3:30am meaning I had to miss my 1am flight to Hong Kong from Vancouver. What a hassle it was for my family waiting in Hong Kong that were all schedules to fly to Japan after 2 hours that I'm supposed to land in HKG. I called them the next day and was rescheduled for 6pm but then I filed for complaint and up until now I have no replies or no one has reached out to me. It’s joke why this type of airline are still operating.

### "airline falls far below all standards"
Avoid this airline at all cost. They delayed my 12:35 am flight flight 7 times 2 hours prior to takeoff, and then cancelled last minute. I called them multiple times at between 7 and 9 am after the flight was cancelled but could not get through due to "Technical issues". After finally getting through to their phone line, I have been waiting on the phone for 3 hours for a customer service representative so that I can ask for my refund. I also have been waiting on their live chat for 2 hours, there were 72 people ahead of me in queue. These wait times mean - many many customers are unhappy right now and that Lynx air has maybe 1 employee working in their entire customer service department. Even if other airlines charge a bit more, it's worth it to pay the extra price for peace of mind and better service. This airline falls far below all standards I have for air travel, I would not recommend this airline to my worst enemy, even though my worst enemy today is Lynx Air.

### "Poor logistics, poor service"
I usually do not write reviews with a good or a bad experience. I usually let bad experiences pass, however I feel I need to write a review to let others know just how poor of an airline Lynx is in terms of logistics and customer service. I had a 7:35 am flight scheduled today which had been cancelled and moved to 8pm. They did not alert me until around 3am in the morning. By email and a voice mail. Naturally I woke up and headed straight to the airport to find out my flight had been cancelled and I had to head back into the city. A few hours notice that your flight has been cancelled and a 3am phone call is not acceptable in the slightest. I then got to airport and had a small gym bag filled with a few changes of clothes and a small work laptop. I was charged $90 dollars to bring this small bag onto the flight an absolutely outrageous price. When I brought up my displeasure at the price and the prior service, I was told to call the airline to complain, this was coming from someone who works in customer service for the airline, and I was argued with. A member of her team even agreed that my bag was just a small bag and should not be charged but she was ignored. Poor logistics, poor service, bad prices, poorly trained staff. Stay away from Lynx

### "CAD 377 for 4 carry on bags"
Very frustrating and poor service. They lure you with lower fare and then their carry on size are so small that you will have to buy checked luggage just for carry ons. So, ultimately you end up paying more than Westjet or other airlines. I had to pay Lynx Air CAD 377 for 4 carry on bags. Also, after taking this much money they only serve you water in flight. More so flight is delayed for 90 min, later I learned that it is a usual practice for Lynx. I suggest to avoid this Airline.

### "flight pushed out for another 2 full days"
First Flight Y9-536: Calgary to Kelowna - Delayed 2 hours without announcement in Calgary. Flight came from Toronto and is always delayed. No gate announcement until 15 min. Before boarding. Second flight Y9-537: Kelowna to Calgary. Delayed by one day, then cancelled. 6 hours later flight pushed out for another 2 full days. No notification SMS or Email received. Claimed for refund since I had to book another flight back to Calgary. System created a case File for APPR. But no response from the Airline. Unprofessional. File a complaint at Air Travel complaint.

### "you get what you pay for"
Not Verified | Flight was booked for a Thursday morning. 2 hours before the flight (when I was already at the airport) they emailed me, saying they postponed the flight to a Thursday night red-eye due to "an issue beyond anyone's control" with no further elaboration. So I re-booked my bus connection, which cost a fee to change last minute. That afternoon, Lynx emailed me again, changing the flight to Saturday - not the earlier flight on Friday morning, I had to find that one myself - and re-book my connecting bus yet again, which cost me more money. No reason was given this time, just an email. I got to the airport on Friday morning, and the flight was delayed yet again. Not even an email this time, I had to find out at the airport kiosk. I missed my connecting bus, and Lynx is now pretending they aren't responsible for any of it. I guess "you get what you pay for", but I've never had a problem with Flair or Swoop. If I had known I'd be out this much for the connection, I'd have taken a better airline.

### " made up time after 15 minute late departure"
Second flight, no issues vs Flair, who failed miserably. Even made up time after 15 minute late departure. I did not find cabin crew to be very personable on either flight though, not that I care for an hour long ride. For $50 and saving me 8 hours of driving is worth it. Seats are more comfortable than WestJet and good legroom.

### "Avoid at all cost"
Avoid at all cost. No customer service, with Nexus cards we were sent to 45 minutes wait for regular security check as Lynx "is not a partner" of this program. We had to wait 2.5 hours to take off from Orlando inside the plane with no AC, and another 2 hours to exit the plane in Toronto as regular airlines were given priority and Lynx passengers were treated as dirt. Every aspect of customer service is sub-zero.

### "Zero customer service"
Not Verified |  Online check in system does not work. Our family and two others on our same flight had our bags left behind at Toronto. Zero customer service - nobody at the airport after the flight lands and nobody will answer the phone. All done through the website “chat” feature. Bags flown to Orlando 2 days later, but nobody told me. I found out by tracking my AirTags. I contacted customer service to ask about this and no answer. I went to the airport 5 days after our flight in to track down staff who finally gave us our bags. Now back home, and still going through a chat system to upload claim forms for a refund. Worst customer service I have ever seen. Untrained and ill equipped staff. The only positive was an uneventful flight.

### "What a huge disappointment!"
Not Verified |  We arrive to Calgary airport at 12:30pm. Our flight was for 2.40pm, found out it was delayed until 8.40pm. Online it said that it was on time. We sat and waited a couple of hours, and then checked back in to find out the flight was totally cancelled with no explanation as to why. Multiple times we tried calling Lynx Air, they kept hanging up on us. We ended up booking through Porter Air, for the following morning at 6.30. We had to pay out of our pocket for a hotel, flight and a cab to and from. Not impressed with Lynx Air, I would never fly with them again, and I would highly recommend, no one flying with them. What a huge disappointment! I missed work on Friday, as well.

### "needs operational improvements"
They need to stick to flight and gate times. Arriving early is not safe and forces passengers to sit on runways and wait for gates. ( leg one) We went from early arrival to leaving late as the airport tried to accommodate the unplanned adjustment. Sadly leg 2 we arrived late back in Edmonton, then had to sit and wait for another plane to leave our gate… more schedule change adjustments. Very disappointing experience on both flights home. The flight there was much the same, delayed x2 then ridiculous experience in Toronto as we remained on the plane for a extremely long “quick turn” add 3 hours of crazy experiences to your flights both directions. This airline definitely needs operational improvements.

### "I wouldn't recommend"
Awful experience. Flight was delayed several times, ended up leaving 7 hours late. Only received email notification for 2 of the delays so was unaware of the final delay. Was sitting with a couple in the airport who were taking the same flight, they contacted Lynx and were told the flight was cancelled and so they rebooked through a different airline. Turned out the flight was not cancelled. At first it was "maintenance issues" then it was "delayed inbound flight". Couldn't get a straight answer. Flight was then overbooked and multiple people had to be cancelled. Once we were boarding the plane we were told seat numbers on our boarding passes didn't matter and to sit anywhere we wanted. I'm sure this caused annoyance for people traveling together as we were told it as we were walking inside the plane to our seats. Everything seemed very unorganized and chaotic. Return flight was a bit easier but still delayed over an hour. I wouldn't recommend this airline if you are looking for reliable and timely flights. Chairs had charging ports in them, but they didn't work. They did provide water which was nice. Didn't end up being much cheaper than other airlines once you pay for luggage.

### "abysmal customer service"
Not Verified |  I recently had the unfortunate experience of booking a flight with Lynx Airlines, and I can confidently say it was the most nightmarish travel encounter I have ever endured. From the moment our journey began, it was clear that Lynx Airlines was utterly incompetent and completely indifferent to their customers' plight. We were scheduled to board our flight at 8 PM, with an expected arrival time in Calgary at 10:30 PM. However, this journey quickly descended into chaos as our flight was plagued by continuous delays. After waiting at the airport for an agonizing six hours, our hopes were dashed when we received the devastating news that our flight had been canceled. Seeking assistance, we approached the Lynx Airlines staff, hoping they would take some responsibility for the situation. To our dismay, their response was  dismissive, stating that they couldn't do anything and that we should contact Lynx Airlines instead. Frustratingly, when we tried to reach out to Lynx Airlines, we were met with a deafening silence as we waited for three hours on the phone, with no one bothering to answer our call. In desperation, we turned to Kiwi.com, the platform through which we had booked our flight. Regrettably, even they offered no help or support. They simply told us that we could schedule another flight, which was set for two days later. This was an impractical solution, considering I was traveling from another country and had limited time before my return to Sweden on Wednesday. It was absolutely inconceivable to catch a flight under such circumstances. The lack of understanding and assistance exhibited by both Lynx Airlines and Kiwi.com was beyond frustrating. Their failure to communicate effectively, return our calls, and provide any form of resolution exemplifies their abysmal customer service. Furthermore, their refusal to refund our hard-earned money in light of the dire situation is utterly unacceptable.

### "cheap flight is not worth it"
Horrible service. my flight was said to be delayed 3 times, but it took off at a completely different time then all my emails, the time on the board at the airport, and the website. It was all different. The flight it self was Meh, do not recommend. The cheap flight is not worth it.

### "worst airline experience"
I have never made a negative online review but this is truly the worst airline experience I have ever had!! I paid $90 to check a bag, I made sure to check the bag at the counter with airline staff, the bag gets lost in transit on a direct flight!! I’m told it will be delivered to me in 24 hours. 24 hours passes there is no update. I’m paying out of pocket for simple clothing like bras and underwear. I try to call the 1 877 number and every time I am on hold waiting in the que, the line hangs up on me. I have sent several messages in Net Tracer which I was told would have quick responses and no one has responded… not once in 48 hours!! How is this an emergency communication line? And worst of all I have to go buy a new bridesmaid dress, wedding day gift, shoes, earrings, make up and purse OUT OF POCKET because this airline hasn’t delivered my baggage and it has been 48 hours since I landed! Also I would like to note I flew from Toronto to Halifax one of the most common domestic flights in the country. There has probably been 12 flights to Halifax from Toronto since I landed. This is truly the worst customer service and airline experience I have ever had. Unless I am fully refunded for my flight, checked baggage and all incurred expenses I would never recommend or fly with Lynx ever again!

### "horrible service, horrible system"
Not Verified | The absolute worst airline I have ever dealt with. First my flight gets delayed an hour. No big deal, then another hour, then another. Then it gets cancelled. I never got an email saying it was cancelled, they just verbally told us. I also never saw my flight on the departure board in the airport. I along with the rest of the flight stand in a like for approximately 2 hours. They did provide hotel and transportation if needed. I get an email saying my flight was rebooked to 8pm the next night, although there was a flight at 7am the next morning. I get it switched to the 7am flight. I get a taxi service provided by Lynx, it has my flight written on it so the driver had proof I can use the ticket. I go to my place, sleep for 2 hours, then come back for 5am (2 hours before my flight for domestic) I get in the line for the Lynx desk so I can pay for a tag for my carry on (83$). I tried to do it online but it would not let me so I was hoping they would charge me the online rate but they did not. They charged me before my boarding pass was printed so I lost 83$! My boarding pass would not print and the agent didn’t understand why. She looks at my boarding pass and I am on the flight for 8pm! After I stood in line and got my flight changed to 7am! They said I had to call Lynx at 7am. Thankfully the flight was already delayed 2 hours so I would have time to call them and switch it. I called right at 7am and the line was busy, I called a total of 25 times and the line was constantly busy. It tells you to stay on the line to talk to an agent and right after that message, it hangs up on you. I went up to the desk and asked if they are able to help call and give me assistance as I didn’t want to keep being hung up on and the flight was leaving in an hour and a half! I was never able to get through to someone on the phone, had to end up booking a new flight with Air Canada as I couldn’t sit in the airport for another 12 hours with no food and sleep. I would give Lynx a 1/10 as they provided hotel and transportation if needed. Other than that, horrible service, horrible system, rude agents, not organized at all. Never again will I be spending my money toward this airline!

### "Emails have gone unanswered"
I'd rate Lynx a "0" if that were an option. Calgary to Winnipeg, 26 May 2023. The flight was delayed by almost 4 hours. Lynx had my email and cell yet did not advise me until I arrived at the airport, 3 hours before originally scheduled departure, as the confirmation email demanded. They offered no apologies, no meals, and no compensation of any kind, and there were no staff at the departure gate to approach with questions. After sitting there for 3+ hours I noticed people coming to the gate, so I asked them what flight they were taking and, if they were also going to Winnipeg, how did they know to arrive when they did. They told me that they had received emails the evening before advising them of the new departure time. When the gate staff finally arrived they told me that the aircraft had been in Calgary overnight and wasn't delayed due to weather or issues elsewhere. It was simply due to staff shortage. I asked for clarification and why some had been advised the night before while many hadn't, and she acted as if I shouldn't be surprised, let alone annoyed. She offered only what felt like an insincere apology, and I got the impression that she had been put in this position many times before. Fast forward 40 minutes or so, and literally as they finally announced that boarding was commencing "in a few minutes" they also announced $10 "food vouchers" that were good only in the Calgary airport and only from that moment until departure. Few people took this seriously as they couldn't see how they would be able to get anything and be back in time to board. I had already been in the airport for 7 hours without eating, so decided to take advantage of this "offer" at a nearby sandwich shop. These vouchers were handmade and looked like some child's scam attempt. The cashier looked at it and literally laughed and called over a co-worker. She said "I'm surprised that Lynx is still pulling this. They know that no one accepts them, yet they are still handing them out? I'm sorry to tell you, but that is worthless. I paid for the sandwich and made it back just in time to board. Once on board I could hear many people peppering the flight crew with questions similar to mine and realized that they were unable to offer any help. Once in Winnipeg there were no gate staff to discuss this with, so I called Lynx once at my destination. I waited on the phone for two hours with no one ever answering. I've called back 3 times since, and no one answers the phone. I've contacted them through their online option and only ever received BOT replies. Emails have gone unanswered. Today I called again and enabled the speakerphone. 5 hours later, and I had to plug in the charger. 7 hours later and still no one had answered. They obviously are not even slightly interested in customer satisfaction or growing a successful airline. Fly Lynx only if you have financial constraints AND if you have plenty of time to waste. And definitely DO NOT fly with them if you have any kind of commitment at your destination.

### "Terrible airline"
Terrible airline. Our flight was delayed multiple times. We were supposed to be in a bachelor party but we were over a half-day late. This is unacceptable

### "rapidly became a nightmare"
Not Verified |  Toronto to Calgary and back. What should have been a routine in and out trip rapidly became a nightmare. Outbound Flight two hours late leaving Pearson because one or more crew members was still tired from their flight in from Vancouver. Inbound Flight delayed 5 hours due to "late arrival of plane". Flight then cancelled due to no particular reason. Waited two hours for the email notification only to find out Lynx were offering a new flight to Toronto, 3 days later.

### "Never flying with them again!"
Not Verified |  Flight delayed 2 hrs 45 min. Get to Calgary waited 2hrs no luggage appeared. Received next day at 3pm. Now flight home delayed from 3 45pm to 840pm!! Ridiculous. Had to change bus booked to airport and our pickup in Toronto. Communication lacking. Hoping not delayed again, or lost luggage. Never flying with them again! On hold 45 minutes, still holding.

### "lack of communication and assistance"
Not Verified |  We are now with lost luggage and no response from the airline. We have had zero communication other than a generic no reply email advising that they have received our cost baggage claim. We have advised them if the location in terminal 1 which we are aware of by way of air tag and still no assistance and no communication. There is no way to reach an actual live person, no direct email. There is no representative to speak to and they have advised there is no email to direct our concerns to other than through the general complaint site. Our emails have gone unanswered. We will never fly Lynx again. There should be no reason luggage can’t make it on a direct flight from Toronto to Florida and no reason for this lack of communication and assistance.

### "charged 100.00 for the mini-suit case"
Not Verified |  The discount airline had a great promotion. We flew Toronto to Winnipeg. TORONTO: Check in at Counter was easy, staff were friendly + cheerful. We had 3 backpacks + 1 mini suitcase. We were not charged extra. Boarding Pass said Gate 38. However, upon sitting at an empty gate with no plane, i happened to check email + saw the gate had changed to Gate 32. We almost missed boarding. Flight Crew were friendly. Planes are brand new and have modern blue lighting. Carpet was bright patterns, similar to a cruise ship. WINNIPEG: Check in at Counter was quick, however i was charged 100.00 for the mini-suit case carry-on. Upon paying it, the Counter Agent handed us the Boarding Passes + informed us our flight was delayed by 4 hours. This flight was later cancelled, of which i saw on the Winnipeg Airport webpage. LYNX never emailed us about the cancelation. I contacted the airline and we were able to get on the morning flight (next day) to Toronto. This flight was delayed by 1 hour. The airline gave us 40.00 voucher for food/drinks for any restaurant or store in the airport.

### "Don’t fly this airline"
Not Verified |  I arrived three hours early as suggested by airline. Our flight was to leave Orlando at 2:35. We were told that the plane was delayed in Jacksonville, a city that can be reached by car in less than a hour. We were told it was due to weather and the need to refuel. I checked the weather forecast in Jacksonville, forecast rain drizzle. It is now 6:39, and they still don’t when the flight will arrive. This airline is trash, it might seem that you are saving money, but you will pay it all back for the cost of the luggage. The ticket agents are stating that when they called to track the plane, they are being hung up on. Now it seems that they are trying to get people to cancel reservation. Don’t fly this airline you will regret it if you do.

### "utter disorganization was on full display"
Not Verified |  Our expectations of this airline were low, expecting a low frills experience. Not only were our low expectations not met, but their utter disorganization was on full display. Our story echoes others in that we arrived suitably early for our flights (both to and from our destination) only for us to find hours long delays in boarding. Their claims of weather delays lacked credibility and after I advised their counter staff of their obligation to provide updates every 30 minutes did they start sharing info. I don’t recommend buying tickets too far into the future.

### "Avoid this airline"
Not Verified |  Total Nightmare. Booked flights for a round trip from Toronto to St. John’s. Not worth the savings. The level of stress of having to deal with their ridiculous level of unreliability is just too much. They tell you to be there at least a couple hours early and then delay your flight by at least a few hours. We were at the airport at 5 am for a 7:20 am flight and didn’t take off until 10:20 a.m. They’ll keep you having to check for delays constantly because they’ll just keep furthering an original delay and then have you sit on the tarmac for ages. The way back from St. John’s to Toronto was, unbelievably, even worse. A two and a half hour delay and an additional hour and a half sitting on the tarmac in Toronto just waiting for our gate to be available (with very little communication from staff until people started getting angry) made for a harrowing 7 hour ordeal, all for what was supposed to be a quick 3 hour flight! Could have flown to Europe by then. Avoid this airline! It’s just not worth it.

### "This airline is a joke"
Not Verified |  When flying from Toronto to Vancouver, the flight was delayed by three hours. Then when I was to come back to Toronto I get an email that my flight is cancelled at 9.30 pm and the flight was to depart at 12.10 (departure was supposed to be 11.10 but was delayed. I saw the nasty reviews of this airline but decided to give them the benefit of the doubt. This airline is a joke and should cease operations soon. I learned my lesson that it’s better to spend a few hundred more and fly with a peace of mind.

### "They cancelled the flight"
I booked a return ticket for Toronto to Calgery. When I boarded from Toronto the flight was changed I waited there for almost 4 hours and a lot of people who were expecting a flight to Vancouver with Lynx were in panic as they changed the departure time repeatedly then ultimately cancelled, and the crew was handling it as normal situation. The same happened to me today, I’m sitting at Calgary airport while writing this review. They cancelled the flight and changed it two days later, and again the were acting normal. They book the flights, if there are enough profit giving passengers the flight departs otherwise they cancel it right away, and it happens every day. I highly recommend not to travel by this flight.

### "cancelled the flight at the last moment"
They cancelled the flight at the last moment when I was about to board after all the checking process was done around 11:50 pm (Midnight). They didn’t provide the accommodation and rescheduled our flight next day for the same time. Very unprofessional and left all the passengers by themselves on the airport. What should we do on airport by losing our sleep and 24 hours? Who will pay for our sleep and time as we need to show up for the work next day?

### "Highly unorganized"
Highly unorganized, highly useless flight, though flight crew is ok. Supposed to start at 8:00 clock. Writing this review siting in the flight at 1:00 at night. They start loading the cargo after the boarding. Boarded the flight after waiting for 4 hours at airport. First and last time I am flying with this airlines. Really frustrating and disgusting.

### "will not recommend this airline"
Not Verified |  This airline is totally unbelievable. Our flight schedule was 9.15 pm and when we arrived Vancouver airport to check in, we were notified that the flight was delayed to 1 am! We didn’t receive any email notification. After checking in our luggage, we went home. We returned to the airport and found the flight was further delayed to 1:45 am. Again, no notification. The flight landed Vancouver airport around 1:15 am and then passengers came out. Right after that we were boarded. The seat was dirty and I doubt there was any check up on the airplane. When we arrived Calgary it was 4:30 am and after getting our luggage it was 5 am. We booked a hotel at the airport and it was totally wasted. All we got from the airline was a $10 each food coupon and a card for us to call the customer service. For a flight of 1 hour and 15 minutes, a 4.5 hours delay is totally unacceptable. I will not recommend this airline to anyone.

### "not worth the cheap flight"
100% not worth the cheap flight. Airline staff at the Fredericton airport were clueless, unprofessional, and slow. I was flying with my dog in cabin which cost me more than Air Canada to begin with. Lynx staff had me constantly putting her into the carrier and pulling her out; one told me dog could be out of the carrier in the lounge, another went out of her way to let me know my dog wasn't allowed to walk on the carpet even though our flight was substantially delayed and the dog needed to stretch after 3hrs in their rinky dink one-cafe airport. When I checked my checked my bag in at the desk employee didn't even recognize I had a pet or ask me to weigh her until I mentioned it to her on my way out. You get what you pay for. Lynx staff in Fredericton made a stressful trip even worse and could use some basic customer service training. I won't fly Lynx again after this.

### "it was an absolute nightmare"
I recently had the unfortunate experience of booking a flight with Lynx air, and it was an absolute nightmare from start to finish. I cannot stress enough how disappointed and frustrated I am with their service. On the way to Toronto, the flight was delayed multiple times and I ended up spending six hours in the airport waiting. When I finally arrived, they lost my baggage and it took an additional 3 hours for them to locate it. Then, on the way home, the flight was plagued by endless delays, yet again. As if that wasn't bad enough, the ultimate blow came when my flight was abruptly canceled at 2am, leaving me stranded with no viable options. To add insult to injury, the airline's representative, who seemed indifferent to my predicament, advised me to wait for an email containing a hotel voucher. She promised me it would come soon. Unfortunately, that email never arrived, leaving me with no choice but to endure a grueling 11-hour stay at the airport. This kind of disregard for their passengers' well-being is simply unacceptable. The most infuriating part of this ordeal was dealing with Lynx air's customer service. Getting through to them was a herculean task, as I spent hours on hold, only to be met with an unhelpful and rude attitude. Their lack of empathy and unwillingness to assist me in any meaningful way deepened my frustration and solidified my decision to never fly with this airline again. I strongly urge anyone considering booking a flight with Lynx air to think twice. Their unreliability, poor communication, and utter disregard for customer satisfaction make them a company not worthy of your time or money. Don't let their enticing prices deceive you; the headache and stress they will subject you to are simply not worth it.

### "nothing but silly issues"
Not Verified |  Right from the get go, nothing but silly issues with this joke of an airline. From rude check in staff to unrealistic baggage size requirements to delayed flights this airline is not worth the reduced ticket prices. We tried to take a personal item on board which is actually designed to fit under an aircraft seat and have flown with it multiple times with many other airlines. They made us check it because it had wheels and a handle, which cost us an extra $100. On the way back they required my duffel bag carry on to be checked due to "size restrictions" even though I had just flown with lynx and used the same bad as a carry on with lynx on the flight in. Pretty sure this is a scam. I've never seen an airline perform this badly.

### "left stranded at airport waiting for hours"
Not Verified |  Most disgusting airline. I have tried this twice and their were delayed for both the times. They don’t respect your time and won’t even send prior information so you are left stranded at airport waiting for hours.

### "Worst airline I have ever traveled on"
Not Verified |  Worst airline I have ever traveled on. I have never seem such unprofessional staff in an airport in Canada, I won't even get in to it about the cabin crew. They make the flights look cheap but then you have to pay for everything so you might as well just stick with your normal carrier, it might save you money. Travel with more established flights the level of service is better even if you are paying a bit more. I have never seem people at a check in counter just sitting there eating away when they should be helping clients.

### "canceled and rescheduled up to 4 days after"
Horrible experience, the flight was delayed 3 hours and they said it was a "slight" delay because the previous flight had landed late. Then the flight was delayed another 3 hours and they blamed it on the weather. Finally, the flight was canceled and rescheduled up to 4 days after the original flight. The company provided no accommodation and customer service never answered the phone.

### @not an enjoyable experience@
Figured I'd try Lynx Air as the price is very affordable. That is their only redeeming quality. My flight was delayed in total by 11 hours. The real problem was that the flight was delayed 4 times throughout the day, meaning most of the passengers arrived early and we're waiting around anxiously for hours. It was not an enjoyable experience at all. The staff had very little sympathy (which okay.. I get it since this airline is now notorious for delays). When finally on board, the staff were very inexperienced and lacked the grace of attendants on the larger airlines. Overall 3/10.. those 3 points only come from the affordability. I won't be getting on another Lynx flight ever. I'd rather pay a bit more and have the security of a more reputable airline.

### "you run a waste service"
Originally flight was scheduled on 29th June 00:35 (12:35 AM). Interestingly this flight got delayed from 12:35 AM to 1:30 AM. I booked this tickets from Trip.com and I get the notification on 1:35 that your flight departed. Thanks for choosing us. I was like they didn't even start the boarding. It's 2:15 AM Finally made my way to sit inside the plane and pilot announced "We are still waiting for one crew member who is coming from Calgary and that will take more 15 mins". No apologies. Shame on you that you run a waste service that even your staff doesn't follow your rules. I was supposed to reach Toronto before 6:30 AM. Now I will reach there 4 hours later and no sleep for entire night. I frustrated and angry on myself because I paid $350 for my emergency.

### "hours waiting for a crew member"
Pathetic service. This airline does not understand basic concept of time is money. First they delay the flight and then they spend hours waiting for a crew member who was late for already delayed flight. What’s wrong with them? They don’t serve food and drinks so what do they need additional crew member for?

### "Worst experience I’ve ever had"
Worst experience I’ve ever had. Check in line was insane, instead of helping us, all people at front service deck were talking and chatting. Bad attitudes as well. Never flying with Lynx again.

### "far below the standards expected"
Not Verified | A Disastrous Journey with Lynx Air: Delays, Lost Baggage, and Dismissive Staff. Rating = 1-star. I recently had the misfortune of booking a flight with Lynx Air for a trip from Toronto to Orlando and back. Unfortunately, my experience with this airline was nothing short of a nightmare. From start to finish, every aspect of my journey was marred by delays, lost baggage, and a complete lack of basic customer service. The first sign of trouble emerged when my flight from Toronto to Orlando was delayed by a staggering three hours. Little did I know that my return trip would be an even more harrowing experience. Upon arriving in Orlando to catch my flight back to Toronto, I was informed that my baggage had been misplaced. This added insult to injury, as I had already endured a lengthy delay and was eager to return home. The mishandling of luggage is a serious matter that should not be taken lightly, and the fact that Lynx Air could not even ensure the safe arrival of my belongings is unacceptable. To make matters worse, the customer service provided by Lynx Air's staff in Orlando was utterly disappointing. The employees appeared disinterested and showed a complete lack of empathy or professionalism. Rather than addressing passengers' concerns and providing assistance, they were dismissive and even rude in their interactions. It was clear that customer satisfaction was not a priority for this airline. Additionally, it is worth noting that throughout the entire journey, Lynx Air failed to serve any food or refreshments on the flight. Traveling for hours without any sustenance only exacerbated the already unpleasant experience and left passengers feeling neglected and undervalued. In summary, my encounter with Lynx Air was marked by extensive delays, lost baggage, unprofessional staff, and a lack of basic amenities. I would strongly advise anyone considering this airline to explore alternative options. The level of service and care provided by Lynx Air falls far below the standards expected in the aviation industry.

### "airline is completely trash"
Pathetic Airline with no proper support and ill-mannered staff. My flight got cancelled and no information was given to us until we reached airport for Check-in. Airport screens, email and Lynx App continuously showed that flight is postponed but nothing about cancellation was told. After the cancellation, no proper alternative was suggested. They straight away just booked flight after 2 days and that too I got to know when I logged in into the account. Tried emailing them, numerous calls but no response from their side. Even went to Airport for a solution, but the staff was too rude and said we are low budget and thus cannot do anything. Its a No No from me. If you are looking for something low budget then go for Flair or Swoop atleast they have a Support System. But this airline is completely trash.

### "Awful experience"
Worst airline experience of my life. My flight to Vancouver was delayed 3 hours because “the pilot hadn’t shown up”. I had unfortunately already booked my flight back to Toronto on Lynx. This was delayed 2 hours (including over an hour while sitting in the plane) and 25% of the passengers were unable to fly. Not only was the flight overbooked, but there was insufficient staff to legally fly at max capacity, so ~40 passenger weren’t allowed on. Then they spent an hour manually calling people’s names and checking tickets trying to find out who they had missed at the check-in to ensure they didn’t go over the legal limit. Awful experience. Tried to save $70 on flights vs Air Canada and ended up wasting several hours of my life. Do not fly with them. Also no water or outlets on the plane.

### "disappointed on a massive scale"
Not Verified | I flew with Lynx air for 2 flights and both flights entered the top 2 worst flying experiences immediately. You don't expect much of an airline when the price is low. However, even with low expectations, Lynx disappointed on a massive scale. We sat on the tarmac for hours because they miscounted the number of passengers on the plane, there was no renumeration for delaying the flight for hours, and the pilot showed up to the flight 2 hours late. Please don't fly with them. By the time you pay $100 for your carry on bag, it's better to pay the extra money to fly literally any other airline.

### "Delayed for 3 hrs"
Not Verified | Delayed for 3 hrs and when all passengers seat in airplane they wait more than 30 min for another passengers. One of the worst airlines with cheap crews

### "what an inexcusable delay"
First time flying today and what an inexcusable delay. They were understaffed and waiting for crew member. This was a poor coordination on the airline. Original departure delayed less than 3 hours which could have been a basis for compensation if more than 3 hours yet there were no offer of food or drinks. 2 hours of lost time just sitting in the airport

### "I would fly with them again"
I would fly with them again. Smooth flying by the pilot. Water was offered 2 or 3 times. Flight was cancelled 2 weeks before but the site was easy to navigate to choose a new flight. They gave me a $10.00 food voucher for the flight delay. I thought that was nice. I didn’t even ask for it. They sent me an apology e-mail twice when they double charged me due to some third party software issues. For an ultra low cost airline they are definitely better because they are only 1.5 years old. Upholstery inside the plane is still fairly new. Downside: seats do not recline. A short flight might be ok.

### "overcharged for our bags"
Not Verified |  We used Lynx for internal flights in Canada when we were travelling there. Although it was cheap and the flight was fine, I would never fly Lynx again. We were severely overcharged for our bags at the airport for no apparent reason, and despite immediately contacting customer service, it took weeks for them to accept this. They are very slow to reply by email and the online chat clearly does not communicate with whoever is operating the email, as I would have something confirmed by chat and then receive an email that said something else. I have been waiting on a refund for almost two months and am no closer to having it issued, as apparently the 'Finance department' are dealing with it and have been doing so for nearly two months (despite multiple emails and chats confirming that the refund was processed in May and would take 3-5 days to come through). The customer service is appalling and they are clearly just wasting my time. They also do not have any complaints procedure, as when I tried to complain I was just directed to the generic email address (which I very rarely receive replies to, if at all). OK flight-wise but really, really bad customer service. Would not fly with them again.

### "I had a great experience "
I flew from Los Angeles to Calgary for a second time and had an amazing experience. For the 1-way flight, it was only $97! Which is amazing given that the next cheapest direct option that day was Air Canada at $580. The new 737 MAX planes are new and nice. I think most people don't give these airlines a chance because they assume they fly old rundown planes when it is completely opposite. The boarding process was super efficient and actually started a few minutes earlier, which allowed us to pushback and takeoff on time. The staff were friendly, and we landed 30 minutes early. That was the second time I had a great experience with Lynx and would fly them again in a heartbeat.

### "Can't really see the advantage of flying Lynx"
Not Verified |  After searching flights across different airlines I found the price for air travel with Lynx not to be of much more of a value to fly with them v/s WestJet. For $30 more I know we would be getting better on plane entertainment, comfort seating and a more reputable airlines. I found the charges for seating to be competitive but for 1st bags checked is where they make up $$. Can't really see the advantage of flying Lynx although they seem to be owned by WestJet.

### "It was such chaos"
Whole experience was extremely negative. I paid $90 just to be able to check a bag, but they lost my bag. How do you lose a bag on a direct flight? Worst part is it’s been over a day and they still haven’t contacted me about where my bag is. I needed all my stuff for my trip. Customer service has been literally awful. No one is replying to my emails with updates the chat bot was absolutely useless. I paid $90 just so they could lose my bag and barely communicate. It would be one thing if it was delivered to me the next day but I am left wondering if I will see my personal items ever again. I am never flying with them again. On top of that, when I arrived at the airport I checked my bag in. At the very end they hand me my ticket and they tell me my flight was delayed 3 hours. I go through security and then afterwards I find out it’s actually on time again but it’s moved gates. It was such chaos

### "likely to lose money and gain a headache"
You may see the odd positive review of people who were lucky enough to have nothing go wrong. This is a rare circumstance and you are more likely to lose money and gain a headache. I flew, or attempted to fly, from Calgary to St. John’s last week via Toronto. We started off with delays. Staff on the flight are mostly new and young. While they’re courteous enough they are also unprofessional (taking selfies with each other throughout the flight, served water to each other prior to serving customers). We got all the way to above St. John’s and were told our flight could not land in St. John’s due to heavy fog therefore we were taken back to Toronto. Of note, many flights from other (more reputable) airlines landed just fine around the same time. It’s also questionable why they took us back to Toronto when they have closer gates to land at, I assume this was due to not wanting their aircraft out of commission for other flights, easier to inconvenience us. We were told a gate agent would be waiting when we got back to advise us of hotel accommodations and food voucher arrangements. There was one agent waiting who had no info. She insisted we had all been sent emails with the info, despite us repeatedly stating we had not. When Lynx does not have flights scheduled they do not have staff in the airport therefore there was no one to assist us with anything. Our bags took 2 hours to get back off the plane, with mass confusion as to which carousel they would even come to. No emails ever came (I was on a return flight the following week with passengers on this flight who confirmed they too received nothing). Lynx made no attempts to contact us to get us home, offer to rebook flights, etc. We spent hours and hours on hold and on phone/support chat trying to get assistance. They could not fly us out until 6 days later which was too late for my travel partner so her whole trip was ruined. I flew out via Air Canada instead at my own expense but lost 3 days of the trips included money lost on car rental and accommodations. Customer service insisted their records show email notifications were sent out (though I magically got all emails with my itineraries and flight delay notifications no problem). I’m now back home and have submitted a complaint and request for reimbursement but I’m not hopeful as emails I sent while in the midst of needing help in Toronto have yet to be responded to. Don’t do it. The “cheap” fares will cost you more money once things inevitably go wrong and there is not even a baseline level of customer support to help you once they do. NEVER AGAIN.

### "Horrible price for carry on baggage"
Horrible price for carry on baggage. They are fooling passengers for cheap flight but it was a joke they will charge you too much. Very basic same amount you pay in airline with comfortable seat and carry on baggage include and snack for more than 4 hrs flight.

### "It was not a good experience"
This was a flight Calgary to Halifax with a stop in Toronto. We were supposed to leave around 6:20 but the night before I received an email that we would be an hour late due to starring issues. No big deal. When at airport, apparently there were maintenance issue with plane and a part was needed and ordered. We were promised things would be resolved shortly. A few hours later, we were told the part was not coming and they were finding us a new plane (flying on empty one from Vancouver to Calgary). By this time, we were supposed to have already ARRIVED in Halifax and the party picking me up said hey - what's going on, your flight on the arrival board shows cancelled. I went to check with the Lynx air gate agents and asked what is happening as our arrival into Halifax shows cancelled. He said, he does not know why that is happening, but our plane will be here in 20 min and we will be on our way (new departure time 3 pm - about 9 hours late). I asked if he was sure this plane would be going all the way to Halifax and I had no interest in staying in Toronto for the night, and its showing cancelled in Halifax. He assured me that the plane would get to Halifax and I boarded the plane, not completely trusting we would get all the way to Halifax. The minute we landed in Toronto we were told we would not be continuing to Halifax, and our flight to Halifax had been cancelled and if we were travelling to Halifax we should call customer service. I learned later that as it was Friday evening customer service was closed and would not open again until Monday Morning. I made my way to the departure level and found a Lynx agent at the check in desk and explained my situation and said I needed help and I did not know what to do next. She said she could not help and I needed to call customer service. I asked if she could at least check and see when the next available flights were to Halifax. She said no - I could do that on my phone. I tried not to lose it. I found out there were no flights to Halifax until Sunday or Monday. No one from Lynx would talk to me. I bought a last minute ticket on Air Canada that departed the next morning and spent the night in the Toronto Airport. On Monday when customer service was open again, I spoke to customer service. They apologized and said there was nothing they could do for me. I told them it was not acceptable to leave us stranded in Toronto without options for accommodations and or rebooking. He took lots of notes, was very sympathetic and said a supervisor would call me in 24 - 48 hours. As you can guess, exactly a week later I still had no call back so I called customer service again. This agent agreed to refund me the approximate $200 cost (in about 20 business days) of the Calgary to Halifax portion of my trip. When I asked about the cost of the last minute Air Canada Ticket I purchased ($250 + 14,200 Aeroplan points) she said she can to nothing about that - I would have to contact compensation department on the website - I have not been able to find a compensation department on the website. I asked her to please refund the entire cost of my booking as Lynx did not do what I paid them to do. She said that could not be done as I took the flights back to Calgary from Halifax. It was not a good experience. Be cautions before entrusting your travel arrangements with this airline.

### "most unreliable and unprofessional company"
My experience with Lynx Air is heartbreaking. Both my fiance and I were on our way to Las Vegs to be married flying out on the 1st June at 8 am. Our travel saga started when the aircraft engines started smoking just before take off and we had to make our way back to exit tunnel at YYC Airport. We then waited on the aircraft for two hours while they tested all engines. After waiting for over 2 hours we were told we must disembark and continue to terminal 73A while they get a new aircraft. Finally, after another three hours we embarked on another Lynx Aircraft and started our journey to Las Vegas. This was not the pinnacle of the story because after our wedding in Las Vegas our return flight was set for 11.30am on the 6th June Las Vegas to Calgary. The standard procedure stated on Lynx Air Web site is a 72hr window check in before departure which I attempted to with no prevail. The morning of my flight 6th June, both my wife and I had little sleep knowing we cannot confirm our flight. We both tried calling Lynx Air and the waiting time on line was a minimum of 2 hrs bearing in mind we are calling from the US. After making contact with customer service we were told our flight is now moved to the 8th of June and there is nothing they can do bout it. They apologised not sending us an email due to a malfunction in their system and we ended up paying for a flight from Las Vegas to Chicago and Chicago to Calgary flying almost midnight 11.30 pm 6th June arriving in Calgary 1pm on the 7th. From a 3 hour journey it now went to over twelve hours of travelling thanks to Lynx Air. This company is the most unreliable and unprofessional company I have ever flown with and I will not recommend anyone to fly with them. I am still awaiting an answer from Lynx Air.

### "harged around $80 for small cabin bag"
No staff at the counter for the 30 minutes, flight delayed for 2 hours, no notification for flight delayed, they charged around $80 for small cabin bag and no one do that. We should go with flair.

### "Tremendously unorganized"
Not Verified | The ticket is cheap. Don’t over expect. Minimum delay is 2 hours. Tremendously unorganized with the unprofessional team. The crew team are too chatty and noisy. During the midnight flight they keep talking loudly, laughing with no consideration. I am so regretful of what I paid to them! Is not worth even a single penny!

### "I'm not flying with them again"
This Airline needs trained Passenger Service Agents. Everyone needs to follow the same rulebook. It was in May 2023 when I flew from Toronto to Vancouver and my bag was little over than 23 kgs and the passenger service agent was kind and she let me through. This time (June 2023) when I flew from Vancouver to Toronto, Its the same situation again. My bag was once again over than 23 kgs. The Passenger Service Agent was not only rude but also said that max she can allow is 23kg. These are her words "The Passenger Service Agent in Toronto might have let you carry luggage that's more than 23 kgs but you are in Vancouver now. I'm not taking more than 23 kgs. Either you pay $103 or just pull out your stuff. I ended up paying the heavy luggage fee because there are some important books in my bag. I get it, the staff is only following rules and I'm not blaming her. But she is in customer service and she shouldn't be rude to the guests like this. Lynx Airlines should train their staff more about customer service and also Why are some people okay if luggage is over 23kg and some people not? Why can't they follow the same rule? I'm not flying with them again. Totally disappointed.

### "This company is terrible"
This company is terrible. From the customer service to the hidden fees, to the inconsistent fees, to blaming everyone else. Our flight was delayed 6 hours- received an email saying my flight was updated, but no change to flight departure. Sat in the airport in Toronto from 6 am until 1 pm. Then we were taxied around for about 35 minutes to the plane, where we sat for another 1 hour. Seat assignment was only for some people - the lady sitting beside me did not have an assigned seat, but upon check in my fiancé and I were told we must have an assigned seat. Be consistent. We checked a bag- they lost the bag. The guy checking it in did not care at all about us checking in (he also knew about the delay but didn’t say anything). When we found out where the bag was lost, turns out he didn’t put it in place to actually be delivered to be on the plane. It didn’t leave Toronto. He also could not figure out how to check it in, so just said it’s free, rather than following steps. No wonder it was lost. Upon arriving, we couldn’t find anyone from Lynx to find out where our bag was. Staff left. We dealt with someone from another airline. Upon checking in to come home: spent 2 hours on hold, to only give up assuming they were not staffed (a 15 minute wait time was a bit ridiculous to be 2 hours and counting). We called the next morning, within 2 minutes of opening- took 45 minutes to speak to an agent, who told us we didn’t have a return flight and wouldn’t look into it. He literally said, I’m not sure figure it out. Upon getting boarding passes, we had to pay to check in our carry on - we did not on the way here? Flight was delayed again. We had a layover in Calgary coming back. A 30-45 min delay was over 2.5 hours (potentially more, gave up on time tracking). No meal voucher provided- but Lynx’s website says they will provide. If I could give a negative stars review I would.

### "on-time, courteous staff"
New aircraft, on-time, courteous staff and what I can ask more from low cost airline. I had 23kg checkin and about 6-7 kg personal (under their size measure) and it was not a single hitch in taking care of my luggage and all in $120, booked one day before! Thanks for your beautiful services within such reasonable price!

### "Disappointed"
This line need to have a longer period for pre boarding for older people that need assistance to get to the plane, the girl that was checking us in just kept saying “ sorry I did call “ but acknowledging the fact there are older people who can’t walk as fast and need extra time. 2 minutes is not okay. They need training with customer service or do a couple more announcements than just one. Disappointed.

### "$85.00 per carryon luggage"
Not Verified |  We left Calgary on June 1/23 to attend our son's wedding, at the check in counter there were at time only 1 person checking people in at a very slow pace and then we were told upon check in the there was a cost of $85.00 per carryon luggage. Our flight was changed from one side of the airport to the total opposite side my husband was in a wheel chair due to mobility issues. Lack of communication all the way around leaving. On June 5th we arrived at the airport and stood in line to be checked in to catch our return flight home, my son went up to the counter to ask if we would be able to catch our flight on time as again only 2 people checking in large groups of people and the lady reassured him that  we would catch the flight. when it was our turn to checkin the same CRS looked at us and said Sorry plane is full and that bag is to big for carryon. She said that there were several attempts to board people going to Winnipeg (which our direct flight was changed to) so we asked for a manager and had to wait a very long period of time hoping to get on the next flight out. I have never ever been treated with such disrespect in my life.

### "Never ever use this airline"
Not Verified |  Never ever use this airline. They won’t be in business long. Customer service is the absolute worst. We flew from Calgary, AB to St. John’s Newfoundland with a layover in Toronto. Our flight got turned around due to weather, nobody’s fault there. The pilot flew us back to Toronto. The gate agent (who had to service 200 passengers) at 10:00pm had no answers. Just shrugged her shoulders. They did not help us with hotel, flight or refunds. The gate agent said we would get an email from Lynx with info on allow to get a refund and hotel credit. That was June 3rd, it is now June 6 - slowest email I’ve ever seen. You lost a customer here Lynx.

### "wish I had checked the reviews"
I wish I had checked the reviews before booking a flight on lynx. Biggest mistake ever. Their customer service is actually the reservations department so they cant help with anything and they are just plain rude. I had a rep yell at me today and then she hung up on me and the one before this told me "do whatever you want" when I said I would call back and talk to a manager. They call themselves customer service. If the whole company shut down they would be doing Canada a favor. I sat on this flight for 3.5 hours with no snacks or meal voucher or anything. They rushed us to board the plane and then we ended up sitting in our seats for over three hrs with no breakfast and when I asked for snacks I was told it was over. I WAS ROW 22! and now I've just been getting the run around with Lynx and no solution and they refuse to transfer my call to a manager also. Imagine that. I don't get how a whole department can be bad at their jobs.

### "not taking this airline again"
Not Verified | First time flying with Lynx Air and my worst experience ever. Lynx air have a policy in their website of personal item measuring 17×13×6inches as free to put underneath the seat and I even brought a measuring tape to make sure my bag is exact of what is in their website. And exact the same bag that I used with all my flights with no extra cost, but Lynx air asked me pay 103 cad for that bag which measures exactly what is written in their policy. That airline is daylight scammer. Don't believe what was written in their website coz when your already in their boarding counter they will ask you to pay for it. The boarding process was so chaotic and several of the passengers boarded without paying with their extra personal items but few of us they asked to pay. They even announced to buy your food in the airport coz they don't serve food onboard, but mind you when your food is in a paper bag, they will consider that again a personal item and part of needing to pay for personal item. I am not taking this airline ever again.

### "Huge disappointment"
Not Verified |  Huge disappointment flying with lynx, first our flight got delayed for more than 24 hours and on top after paying 70$ for the checked in baggage we were refused to take our luggage even being on time. As our boarding time was 5:25am and we reached their 4:45 am, still they told us you are late and after being through security check we were in the lounge waiting to get to the board till 6am. They have ruined our vacation by delaying us for one day and with their misleading luggage policy. Never travelling with Lynx again also I’m trying emailing them but only we get in respond is the automated mails and if u tryna call them there is a wait time of atleast 30-35 mins I guess low staff maybe and that too unhelpful.

### "feel there's a big scam here"
My travel day was June 2 at 00:35 arrived to the airport on time boarding start at 11:50 pm. Coming close to the take off time the fly got delayed the claim is due to one of the air staff was being sick. They started requested how they need about 10 passengers to give up their seat offering new book and hotel stay which I found weird. Boarding started to commence they kept requesting passengers to give up seats and rebook. The airplane was loaded back to front by the time my section was called rows 1 - 15 we weren't getting on the plane. We were volunteered to give up our seats claiming ones again due to short staffing on the plane. All my years of flying I've never come across this or heard of this. I feel there's a big scam here they over book the flight made all these promises we'll get a full refund along with the cost of booking another flight with another airline. I'm still waiting on someone to reach out I've called the customer service number has they open 7am 3 days back to back and look the line is busy! I've waited on hold for 1.5 hour out of one of the 3 days trying to get someone. So I'm out the money on the flight with lynx and paid extra for another the same day in the morning 06:30. In total I paid $680.79 for a 1 way flight for 2 airlines because of this.

### "Flight was delayed 4+ hours"
Flight was delayed 4+ hours and no communication was given whatsoever to passengers. It took 2 hours for them to find a printer just to print a document that they legally require to fly. We showed up 3 hours prior to a domestic flight and they were still not able to take our bags on time and print our boarding passes due to system issues.

### "airline created a lot of unnecessary stress"
Not Verified |  This airline created a lot of unnecessary stress by losing our luggage for 4 days. Myself and 4 daughters had none of our belongings, therefore had to take time away from enjoying our holiday to by essential items and clothing. The flight to Vegas was also slightly delayed but within a reasonable time waiting on a pilot. Trying to track down the luggage was frustrating not only for use but for staff at LAS and our hotel concierge. Our return flight was delayed 24hrs, meaning I needed to pay for another 2 rooms for 1 night in Vegas. We got to the airport 3hrs ahead of time as required by the airline at 830am. To find out just after 9am the flight was delayed until 420pm. Myself, 4 daughters and niece at the airport and eventually boarded around 430pm. My daughters were anxious about the luggage which I was tracking and was not loaded onto the plane. I spoke to the flight attendant about our concerns and rather than listening to what I was saying, she “shushed” me and said let me finish talking. She wasn’t speaking she was interrupting me and rude. Another passenger had the same concern and the flight attendant walked away. She did walk to the front of the plane and at that point returned and I seen the luggage was loading and said thanks, flight attendant could not say you’re welcome or anything just continue trying to get her job over with. All of my daughters are frustrated with this entire trip. 4 of us work with the public and would NEVER treat guests/clients the way Lynx Air treated us. My 16 year old is more professional with communicating effectively with responding to any complaints she has faced. It’s shocking when minors recognize lack of communication skills and values + ethics in business. I have been into contact with Lynx Air directly and hope they resolve all these issues which have costs us an excessive amount of unnecessary spending + time. Including missing work for 3 of us. We strive to have strong work ethic and hope Lynx Air will show respect, compassion and compensate for all the extra out of pocket costs. Lynx Air has refunded luggage fee is $148 and change for the 2 suitcases for the way to LAS. I will follow up this review with the outcome of their response to deal with all our receipts. Until then, I suggest flying a more reliable and reputable airline.

### "will never book with Lynx Air again"
Not Verified |  I paid for my tickets to fly from Vancouver to Winnipeg on June 3rd at 08.00. I arrived at 06.00 to find out there was no flight and no Lynx Air agents to help. I had to book a new flight with Air Canada and they were awesome to deal with. I will never book with Lynx Air again and will now have to fight to get my money back!

### "Will never fly Lynx again"
Not Verified |  Cost of flight was great. The extra add on are terrible when if come to baggage. 1 carry on $89 and change. The policy is if the carry on cannot fit under the seat then you pay to put it in the overhead bins. I flew from Edmonton - Halifax but did not come back with Lynx. I came back AC and paid a few dollars more and had free carry on and a free checked bag. Will never fly Lynx again. It pays to spend a little extra. If you fly Lynx ensure you carry nothing larger than what can fit under the seat

### "Stay far away from this airline"
Not Verified |  My friend and I were planning a trip to Halifax, Nova Scotia. We both purchased our tickets in early February for our trip in June. I rec'd booking confirmation within moments. Fast forward to the night before I was to leave, I went to check in to find out my booking had been cancelled. Shocked, I tried to get ahold of the company with no success. So I purchased another ticket and could still go on my trip. At that point, I rec'd an invoice stating the payment was made, and again I thought I was good to go. But nope, when I went to check in again, again my booking had been cancelled due to a balance remaining. Checking my C/C payment had gone through. I called again, and they said that according to their computer, they have not received payment, and if it does register, it will take 3-5 days to refund. So I booked through another site for the same flight. That site did not send confirmation until 10 minutes before the flight left. So I could not make the flight. I ask Lynx to refund that as well; they are not responsible for anything of that nature. So I spent 1478.20 with Lynx and went nowhere. So I rebooked on a different airline for 660.00. and have a direct flight. To NS and return to Alberta. My friend did make the flight. It was to leave Calgary at 6:20 am with a connector in Toronto. They left Calgary at 2:00 pm, and when they landed in Toronto, they learnt that the flight to Halifax was cancelled, so they were stranded in Toronto. Again had to book another airline to get to Halifax. Stay far away from this airline.

### "worst experience ever"
I am avid traveller but this airlines gave me worst experience ever. Delayed by 12 hrs. It made me miss my graduating ceremony. One of the terrible experience and wont recommend to anyone to travel.

### "over $200 CAD for 2 small carry on bags"
Not Verified |  We flew from LA back to Calgary and tried to check in online to pay for our carry on in advance, but their website was having technical difficulties and did not allow us to check in or pay for our baggage. At the airport, we asked for help from their front desk agent (who was 3rd party/NOT part of Lynx Air). She witnessed us struggle to sign in multiple times, then called Lynx customer support, who offered no help, and refused to give us the name of the Lynx agent or her name. We paid over $200 CAD for 2 small carry on bags, even though Lynx advertised lower rates online. I called the next day and was promised a supervisor would call me back within the day - there was no call. I called back and was denied to speak to a supervisor this time, as the customer service agent told me we were lying about talking to Lynx over the phone at the airport, that we were lying that their staff at LAX was 3rd party, and there were no notes taken about the situation at the airport. We were offered a $10 voucher by Lynx for all this. We'll never fly with Lynx again - their customer service is abysmal and dishonest. There is no money saved by this 'discount' airline when charged for carry on. A baggage rate was offered that was no honoured.

### "last time we fly with this airline"
I booked this flight for my 12 years old child far in advance. This is not first time we used this airline. In addition, my child flew to Toronto and back to Edmonton at least 6 times. She is very mature and knows what to do. Honestly, I never had issues with Lynx air until Sunday. First, the flight was delayed twice my child was seating at the gate for 3 hours. She asked the desk attendant about the boarding time and was told that it’s not until 10:45pm. At 10:40 pm my child called me crying and stated that the gate is closed and there is nobody at the gate. I do give a benefit of the doubt that she probably stayed on her phone. I am very upset that they did not call her name. She did ask them two times about the boarding time why not get a notice that there is a child travelling alone. As a result, I had to call the family to pick her up at 12:30 am. Extremely stressful situation. Well, she got picked up by family and was safe. Next morning, when I finally reached customer service and after unproductive conversation was called back in couple hours they offered me $50 voucher! Basically, they told me that it is no show. I asked the supervisor to call me back, of course there is no call back! At this point, I really was not looking for some “shut up” $50 voucher. I was looking to get my child on the next flight. This is the least they could do. I book and paid for the next flight with them to get her home myself. Only because it is the cheapest option on such a short notice. However, this is very last time we fly with this airline.

### "horrible from start to finish"
Lynx air has been horrible from start to finish. Issues booking seats, issues paying for luggage, and now 2 hours waiting for our luggage from the plane. There's no help desk, no reps to be found anywhere and not much help from chatting online or calling their help line. I was told that a rep would come to me when I was chatting online and gave her my location. But more than 30 minutes later still nothing. It's unbelievable how incompetent this airline is and how horrible their customer service is. Thankfully the pilot at least knew what he was doing and got us to the correct destination safely. Everything else has been disappointment after disappointment. I unfortunately did not book this flight as it was a work trip. If I had I certainly would not ha e booked with Lynx air and I never will.

### "my worst experience so far"
I fly often on budget airlines and Lynx has been my worst experience so far. There was no online check in option due to technical issues. Thus, I arrived at the airport 4 hours early just to find out that the flight had been delayed 3 hours, no email update given. If you don’t mind a lot of stress, cancelling travel plans, and spending hundreds more than you planned then this is your airline.

### "Today Lynx loses my loyalty"
Today Lynx loses my loyalty. My husband and I have flown with Lynx 8 times in the past year. Two days ago my flight was delayed by 4 hours, and the delay was announced after I had arrived at the airport. I accepted that stuff happens and still got home safely and still defending Lynx. But my flight today has now also been delayed due to staff shortage. The 4 hour delay means I miss my ride after landing, to my final destination. I must overnight. That means I need an overnight bag. I asked customer service if they would allow me to take a carry on bag, cost free, due to this being a result of their delay. That was refused. I could pay an additional cost, the same cost as the flight to take on a bag. Lynx, you've lost 2 of your greatest (former) cheerleaders.

### "It is definitely an affordable airline"
It is definitely an affordable airline, and I did get from point A to B. But that's about it. The airline was over an hour late for both my to and from flights. The staff on the plane was amazing, but the staff in charge of getting people onto the plane were disorganized and confusing. If considering some of the lower budget options for flights, I would recommend Swoop or Flair over this airline any day.

### "Worst joke of an airline"
Worst joke of an airline. Flight over and hour late due to "computer issues" personally checked in online downloaded boarding pass but was denied boarding. Flight still hasn't taken off because they can't get things together. Will never fly with them again no matter how cheap they make it

### "delay ended up being 1.5 hour delay"
Flew with Lynx for the 1st time. I flew from Winnipeg to Toronto for May long weekend. The flight into Toronto was on time; zero issues clean and I was quite impressed. Flight into Toronto was 10/10 for value and timeliness. I also did not check a bag I only brought my personal item back pack- they were not strict with requirements at all cause my backpack was totally full. My return flight however was a mess. Upon getting to Toronto airport to get my boarding pass they stated at the front that I didn’t actually need my boarding pass printed that they would accept it on my phone; I said are you sure? Because the man who was saying this has his female coworker behind him stating no they don’t do that. So sure enough he did not print my pass. Once getting to the gate and close to boarding time they had everyone on the flight create a massive line to get their boarding passes since they were not printed off when they were supposed to be and the pass on the phone was not accepted like that employee had stated. After this had been resolved and they printed passes for nearly everyone they announced 2 flight attendants had not shown up for their shift but that a replacement will be there within 15 min so it would be a 15 min delay. The delay ended up being 1.5 hour delay. Once boarded they announced that had those flight attendants not come in last minute our plane would not have taken off. Luckily I made it home on my scheduled day but I would of hated to know how difficult it would be to deal with them had everyone have to stay and wait for another plane. Still undecided if I’ll use them again- they have been in Winnipeg almost a year already I think I’m going to lean towards flair and swoop for low cost flights as I haven’t had issues like this with those companies

### "I had a wonderful experience"
I had a wonderful experience, I flew with husband and two kids, flight left on time both directions. I am grateful beyond words for an affordable airline that we are able to rely on to fly my family back and forth to visit a family member battling Cancer

### "wonderful woman that checked all 11 of us in"
Not Verified |  We were nervous with this airline as New and the setting up our tickets etc was very concerning. We had 2 delays leaving from Toronto to Orlando do so made a long travel day. On our way home went very smooth but really want to make a shout out to an absolute wonderful woman that checked all 11 of us in! This woman really stood out for us .. she was smiling, very polite, courteous and deserves a raise. She was working May 21st at the check in counter around 10am and her name was Heaven. She was an absolute Gem and made our experience a positive!

### "Pay the extra for Air Canada"
Not Verified |  Horrible. The departure was scheduled to 8pm. It got delayed to 8h30. At 8h30 no-one had opened the gate so we asked and they said that it was opening soon. It opened at 9pm At 9h30 they start the engine. At 9h30 they said it had a problem with the AC and they would give more information once the engineer said something. At 11h30 pm they said that they were going to run tests and say an answer in 15 minutes. 30 minutes later they come and say that they won't be flying. We get out and they said we would receive an email in 15 minutes. It's 2h04 am and we are still at the airport waiting with no signs of email or hotel. Pay the extra for Air Canada, this is not worth it.

### "delay hours before we even checked in"
It was a good price, however we were informed of a delay hours before we even checked in. Ridiculous. Would have been better if they serve at least some snacks.

### "Pathetic flight services"
Not Verified |  Pathetic flight services. Flight delayed and was informed only at the nth moment. Gates changed at nth moment. Had to pay for my seat even during web check-in, ideally should offer some free seat options. Was not allowed to download or keep eboarding pass. Had to obtain physical pass where they charged for baggage. Baggage specifications were met, however, their so called Baggage stand at check in counter was way too less width than actual size below seat. Had to buy Baggage for the cost of that of airfare. I would never ever fly with this airline again, nor recommend their services. Landing was so rough, people clapped when plane stopped. If I could give 0.25 rating, I would do that.

### "The worst customer service"
I have flown many trips with cheap airline like Spirits or Sun Country. Lynx made them all look good. The worst customer service I had ever experienced. They made us pay extra for everything so don't be fooled by the cheap price. I made a promise to my family that i will never fly with them again even if they are the cheapest.

### "made us pay $300 for our 3 bags"
Not Verified |  I will never recommend anyone in their lives ever to fly with Lynx Air. This was the most frustrating and exhausting experience I had. My fiance unknowingly was standing behind the counter when I was obtaining our boarding passes. The lady handling our boarding thought it was a challenge for her and thought we were trying to hide my fiance’s personal item bag. She came out from the counter and pointed out that her bag will need to be paid, not mine nor my fiance's grandma’s, just hers since she wanted to throw some attitude. They made a big fuss about it when we were boarding and our bags easily fitted the personal item criteria a lot of people we asked who didn’t pay anything extra had more stuff, but they all were trying to just target us. To make us more frustrated, they ganged up against us including the supervisor, and forced us to pay for all three bags. Their language was so unprofessional and rude and asked us to get lost if we don’t pay for all the bags. At one point they just ignored us and started taking the next passengers even when we were standing there. They eventually made us pay $300 for our 3 bags even though she pointed at just one bag in the beginning, all of this to target us and show some power. They were going to call security if we didn’t pay, which is scary as a passenger when you are trying to talk nicely with them and as we wanted to board our flight for a very important event. Their staff will make you pay for stuff in one way or another. My flight was Y9116 on May 13th, 2023 at 10:00 am

### "don't be fooled by the price"
Avoid this airline - don't be fooled by the price. Never again - personal items are being charged 90$ pay extra and use Air Canada and not have to deal with this nonsense.

### "Pay more and pick another airline!"
Before I brought ticket I read the reviews about Lynx 1) They are bad at luggage so we should take carry-on, and I did that (thank God) 2) They cancel flight and you learn that in the airport! True! 3) Customer support takes forever to reach (1.5 hours waiting time if you are lucky) True! 4) Nobody helps or explains what is going on at the airport! They keep saying call customer support. True! I had flight flights overseas or domestic (KLM, Lufthansa, WestJet, Swoop, Turkish, Air Canada, United) I have never ever experienced such a horrible airline in my life as Lynx! 1 - they sent email for our Toronto > Calgary on our flight day about arriving at least 3 hours early because Pearson security is busy. 2 - We drove from London Ontario to Toronto with rental car and been in airport 3 hours earlier. 3 - At the airport we learned our flight cancelled! My wife, my daughter and I left at the airport without a car because we already dropped it off because they said arrive early! They will cancel it you will learn at the airport! They will badly effect your all travel plans: - I had to pay my airbnb 1 day for nothing ($115) - I had to pay rent a car an other day ($110). Even worse: 4 - When we called customer support after wait (1 hours 40 minutes) “we drove from London we have no place in Toronto” they told us that they would provide hotel information and they would send it via email “in an hour” then we can stay in that hotel. They also told us according to flight rules they don't have to provide accommodation but they make a big favour for us. 5 - No email arrived and after 2.5 hours we drove around Toronto so my daughter can sleep in a rented car, then someone called me that they can’t find hotel we have to find, and email to customer support (!) and they will reimburse later. 6 - I found a hotel online in 3 minutes. 7 - Next day I called them how would they reimburse the hotel cost, they told me send an email they will back to me, they don’t know yet. 8 - After 7 days (my wife kept calling them and asked accommodation cost) they responded that they approved hotel. Approved? - They offered us ridiculous! 8 - They never told me how they reimburse money and they of a all sudden sent email that they e-transferred money to my correspondence e-mail address which is not associated my bank because no one asked me! 9 - I corrected them its not my email associated with my bank, after another week later they sent another mail that they would transfer money to email address to correct account and I would get hotel cost in 30 days, we will see! Pay more and pick another airline!

### "told we’ve been delayed 24 hours"
Not Verified |  Absolute joke of an airline! Turn up at the airport to board a 8am flight to be told we’ve been delayed 24 hours due to maintenance issues. Not sure how airlines can get away with this.

### "Worst airline ever"
Not Verified |  Worst airline ever. Money grab and will charge you 100$ for a carry on and 100$ for a bag. The instructions are not clear online and to talk to a customer service agent you’ll be stuck on hold for hours. Their staff are also unqualified and raised their voice at me for no reason. I’m totally distraught with how my friend and I have been treated.

### "had to spend the night at the airport"
This is my second time flying with Lynx. I went to the Lynx counter at TO Pearson Airport to check into my flight. I was told I had to pay $225.00 because I changed the flight from April 8th to Apr 7th. The account was locked by Lynx. I did not have the money to pay the difference. So I left the counter and went to see if I could borrow some money to cover the difference which I thought was excessive for a simple flight change. Nevertheless, when I went back to the counter, the agent told me she was trying to get hold of Lynx to get them to free the account so I could pay and check in. No one was answering the phone. So she had me stand aside saying she left a msg and would call me back. I waited for a while and when she did not call me back I approached the desk and she told me I was too late that the gate was closed. Meantime Lynx sent a revised time for the flight departure to my dead cell phone. Why did she not mention/know the departure was delayed. I had to spend the night at the airport because of her inefficiency. I did not use my ticket. I missed the flight because the agent was not paying attention and no one answered the phone in a timely manner to unlock the account. My request for a credit went unacknowledged and unanswered.

### "definitely not worth the save"
Not Verified |  Arrived around 1:15 hours before my check-in and noticed they had a huge line due to only one court having an employee attending people. Decided to wait in line as they were not calling to check-in for our flight yet. Waited for more than 30 min and when finally arrived my time they said that the check-in was closed and said that kept calling people in the line for the last call and even took pictures, which was a total lie, I requested the pictures and they started making excuses that could not show me that. The worst part was that the airplane only left the airport after 2 hours, so if they really wanted to fix the things, they had plenty of time to figure it out and accommodated us. After a lot of coming back and forth, I was told by a supervisor that they would include us, without charges, in the next flight. He mentioned to talk to the customer service and, after I did it, they said that needed a note from this supervisor, and surprisingly, he disappeared. Lynx court just had nobody to talk to the clients and their online and phone costumer service have only 2 people to solve problems to the entire country. Found other people in similar situation and everybody was really upset with what was going on. In order to not delay my life due to a totally disorganized company, I decided to pay for our flight tickets (that at the moment were costing 3 times what we originally pay for the flight that I lost). They offered me a $50 voucher, which the agent said that was going to be applied to my total amount. However, when I finally arrived home and had some time to see my bank statements, I noticed they charged me the full amount (without the discount applied) and promptly contacted them to have that fixed. They said that could not do anything other than give me another $50 voucher. I told them that that was absurd and it doesnt make sense to me as will never fly with lynx again. After threating them with a sue, they finally issued my refund. Long story short, if you want to save money, try perhaps Flair because Lynx it is definitely not worth the save.

### "experience with Lynx has been strange and concerning"
I booked tickets with Lynx in January during their promotion, but later they cancelled my flight and offered a reschedule or cancellation. I chose to cancel and received partial refunds totaling 70% of the original payment in February. However, I did not receive the remaining payment and contacted Lynx. They promised to send it within 20 business days, but I received nothing by the end of March. When I contacted them again, they said the payment had been sent via email transfer. When I requested proof of payment, they changed their story and edited previous emails, which was unsettling. I expressed my concerns and asked for transparency, and in response, they asked me to wait another 20 business days. Unfortunately, it's already May and and I have waited for two sets of 20 business days and still haven't received the payment. I've tried reaching out to them, but they have not responded. My experience with Lynx has been strange and concerning.

### "customer service is the worst"
Not Verified |  Try to avoid Lynx. Their customer service is the worst. They are very disrespectful with persons with language barriers, not native English speakers. I have seen flight attendants and attendants at the gates laughing or eye rolling when a person couldn't effectively communicate their thoughts or concerns. They delayed the flight for 1 hour and we just got an e-mail from them few minutes before the departure time. The boarding process was very frustrating, long, stressful and delayed out flight even more. We lost a lot of time and money! I will try to avoid this airline for my next flights and everyone should do the same until they train their attendants, specially their flight attendants!

### Lynx Air customer review
Not Verified |  Very bad airline. Unfriendly staff. Flight was delayed by two hours without notice. I was not seated next to my wife and told it was not possible. We had to take a bus to get to plane. It took ages. Staff is very unprofessional and aggressive.

### "I try to avoid Lynx at all costs"
Not Verified |  If Lynx Air was ever on time it would be a miracle, I fly a lot within Canada, and I try to avoid Lynx at all costs. Occasionally they’re the only option, or truly one fifth the cost of WJ or AC when flying last minute. I can truly say I have never once had my Lynx Air flight depart on time. The part that bothers me most is they do not notify you of delays until you are obviously already at the airport. I always find it hard to believe they had no idea my flight would be hours late up until an hour before boarding.

### "It may work, it may not work"
If there was only 1 airline you must avoid, it has to be Lynx Air. My 2 times experience with Lynx had been nothing but problems that cascaded into bigger problems with my travelling itinerary. So far Lynx Air scored a 100% when it comes to failure. Lynx being budget also have poor customer service to ensure that your problem will always be unresolved. If you fly Lynx on a connecting, it’s basically a coin toss. It may work, it may not work. Be prepared to cancel your hotels and rentals. As a frequent traveller I have never seen a check in counter close >70mins before boarding or delaying a flight by half a day because “can’t fill seats”. But with Lynx, every screwup is possible, and what I got in return was a inflight meal credit. It’s even written in their T&C, go check out their humour. There’s no value for money too since all I got for thousand of dollars of cancellation is a meal credit. Lynx budget air costs more than first class!

### "appreciated the staff's efforts"
I recently had a connecting flight from YYZ to YWG to YVR with this airline, and although I missed my final boarding call, the staff at the gate went above and beyond to try and help me make my flight. The final boarding staff was amazing and tried their best to get me onto a flight that was already on the runway, waiting for almost an hour for us. Unfortunately, due to security issues, we were not able to get on the flight. They explained to us that they had already made a call to aviation saying the flight was secured and could not let anyone else board after that. While the experience was not great for me, I appreciated the staff's efforts to help us. I don't know the names of those individuals, but if they happen to read this, I want to thank them very much for going above and beyond to assist me.

### "Do not recommend"
Had a terrible time with Lynx Air. The 8 of us were booked for a flight to las Vegas and back starting the 20th of April 2023. We got delayed 3 times and then finally canceled on at 5 minutes to our boarding time. We then had to proceed and scramble to find an alternative flight there and back which ranged from $300 there and $700-2200 on the way back. Lynx never communicated with us via email to say our flight was canceled or our return flight was still available. Myself and one of the other guys I was traveling with tried to get ahold of the Lynx Air via any way possible, phone was a 3 hour wait on hold and no one still answered. Email went straight to a dead end email saying it wasn’t valid. And now I’m still on hold for the fourth time and it’s been 2hrs. Honestly embarrassing and frustrating to run a company like this. Lastly we spent a full day waiting for our next flight encured over $500 in additional costs and lost a full day of planned activities and lost even more money because we couldn’t get our deposit back for some of these activities. Do not recommend what so ever. You get what you pay for and this proves it.

### "Horrible experience"
Not Verified | Firstly delayed 2 hours. Regular usual personal item pack doesn’t have the same dimensions as Flair / Air Canada / Westjet causing me to pay $90 in “check in bag”. When entering my seat because overhead was full they made me put my $90 bag underneath the seat where personal items go. Horrible experience. Won’t fly again

### "travel plan was completely messed up"
6 hours of delay. My travel plan was completely messed up because of their failures. no one there provide any help or costumer service. I will never, ever take it again.

### "very high baggage price"
Terrible Boarding representatives, very high baggage price, The manager in lynx Toronto threatened to make me lose my flight and call the police on me. Last time am flying Lynx Air. The Reps are Rude and lack customer service skills.

### "Don't waste your time or money"
Seemed like an okay priced ticket, not super competitive but just enough that I decided to book here. By the time I paid for my carry on ($90), I might as well have flown with a more reputable and comfortable airline. Additionally, the flight was delayed and unlike other budget airlines there's no food or drinks (including water). Don't waste your time or money to fly with this airline, it adds up quicker than other budget airlines and you'll likely arrive late, frustrated and with a dead phone.

### "What a disappointment"
If I’m going to be charged 90 dollars for a carry on, on a 200 dollars ticket which would cost me an additional 180 dollars on a 2 way; why would I not choose more reputable airline than this one for that price? You get fooled with pricing online when you’re booking till the time you need to check in. What a disappointment.

### "a very good experience"
My wife and I needed a one-way ticket to Calgary from Phoenix and thought we would give this new discount airline a try. The seats were inexpensive, but there was a C$50 charge for each bag, so the plan was to cram everything into one big bag and make sure it was under 50 pounds. We also each carried on a small backpack. When I checked in 24 hours in advance I was a bit annoyed at the fact that TFSA pre-check is not available with this airline, I don't know if the airline has to pay for this, if they do I suppose it all makes sense, after all, the tickets are cheap. The 24 hour advance check-in caused me a bit more grief, I hadn't entered my passport info in advance. It took me a while to figure out I had to bail out of the check-in and go back to the original reservation and add the passport info. I think the IT people should allow this to be entered while checking in, instead of saying passport info needs to be added but not telling you how to add it. The last step of the advance check-in I was put in a seat selection screen with a charge for each seat, I decided to save the cash and had to exit this step which was easy enough. It worked fine except we were put one row from the back of the plane, the joke's on me! At the airport it was old style, they issued us paper boarding passes, and printed up a baggage tag for our porky bag and put it on themselves, I apologized for the weight of the bag and the attendant laughed, telling me she had to deal with 50 pounders all day! Fortunately the lineup for security was only about 15 minutes so the pre-check people only saved 12 minutes on me. We boarded early, left on time, and the beauty of being near the back is that I hopped from the middle to the aisle seat just before takeoff so we had an empty middle seat, pretty fine! The flight attendants were courteous, and they delivered us two rounds of water for this 3 hour flight. The ham and swiss sandwich I made before I left for the airport was outstanding. All in all a very good experience, I should add that after you walk onto the plane you're not subjected to walking by the smug fat-cats in the front rows in first class, and you can use the forward bathroom if you want, a nice change!

### "best to avoid this airline"
Not Verified | Flight booked for May 28 to attend a meeting at destination. A few days after booking, an email from Lynx: Your flight was rescheduled to May 30. Delayed by 2 days - this would be AFTER my meeting has taken place. I call the airline to cancel my flight and am asked to pay a processing fee for cancelling the flight, which I find ridiculous given the situation. After some back and forth, the representative hangs up on me. The second representative sympathizes but still insists on the processing fee, and eventually gives me a number to call Lynx Air directly which leads to a consistently busy signal. I have tried my best to avoid this airline and will now do so at all cost.

### "delayed 7 hours coming back"
Not Verified | No, Never again. Flight delayed 1 hour going to destination and 7 hours coming back. Flight attendants very unprofessional. Captain was great and very professional!

### "avoid this airline at all costs"
Upon arriving at the airport 2 hours before flight and began to check in, we were greeted by an extremely unpleasant Lynx employee. It would appear that we were interrupting his day in order for us to book in. He then told us that our flight was delayed by 2.5 hours. When we asked why it was delayed he seemed not to care and asked for our boarding passes and ID. When we again asked why he was extremely agitated and said I don't know and simply ignored us and told the next passenger to step forward. We then went to a restaurant in the airport and ordered food and contacted Lynx Head Office. After about an hour waiting for someone to answer the phone we were told that they had no indications of any flight delays concerning their airlines and all flights out of Victoria were on time. I was standing in front of the departure board and it clearly indicated that our flight was delayed 2.5 hours. I then took a picture and sent the them. I was informed that there are no delays and they said goodbye. About 15 min after that our flight was yet again delayed another hour. Still no response from the airline or staff. I will never fly this airline again. It is not a discount airline as they charge for more that a major airline would. Please heed this warning and avoid this airline at all costs.

### "has been horrendous"
The consistency and quality of customer service has been horrendous on our trip from Calgary to Vancouver. I was traveling with my three small children unexpectedly when my husband wasn't able to make it. I had called ahead to arrange paid seating to allow me to sit close with my 3 kids. My 2yr old and 4 yr old have never flown before. I had informed them I would have two car seats on either side of me sitting on the plane with my eldest 6 yr old daughter on the opposing aisle seat in a row. The customer service phone rep explained to me that I could pay for seating which I chose to do to ensure I'd be with my children no matter what. I had also requested assistance to and from since I'd have a large check in luggage bag, 2 car seats, backpacks and a wagon. When we arrived the Lynx check-in desk staff were missing completely. They never even showed up and another airport staff member who does not even work for Lynx had to check us in. A WestJet check-in employee attempted to help find the Lynx staff as multiple passengers were in line waiting with myself and my 3 kids. I did not receive any help whatsoever as a mom of three with all our things. The boarding gate staff gave a thirty second window for priority boarding so that I ended up having to fight for space to board with my things and kids which was incredibly frustrating now after the initial lack of staff. Upon boarding the plane, the flight attendant was quick to tell me I was not allowed to have car seats on the plane unless by a window. None of this was shared with me by their phone representative who happily charged me money for arranged seating. Only because the flight was not full I was able to be seated two rows of two so that my eldest was able to sit with my 2 yr old and I sat with my 4 yr old that was upset out of fear from being separated with the way the staff treated us. The multiple staff did not help in any way with our car seats/bags or wagon. Only because of another caring passenger, I was able to get a little bit of help to get us on the plane. The staff on the plane seemed more interested in gossiping the entire flight and gave us no attention. I'm generally pretty easy going but this was a brutal experience. Even with just simple decency, when you see another human being with a lot to carry at once, the normal thing to do is offer a hand, let alone when you've actually already arranged for assistance. The flight attendant was quick to tell me the rules I had to bend to, such as not stepping out of the plane doorway to fold up my wagon to gate check, while no one offer to help with my 3 kids sitting on the plane amongst other passengers. The fellow passengers were more helpful than the staff! On touchdown, again, there was zero assistance departing the plane. I called to now rearrange our already prepaid seating to ensure a better trip back now knowing their rules. The phone rep told me that they reported the situation but wouldn't refund my unused paid seating until they hear back in 1-2 days time from their airport staff. So the only thing I was told for our flight home is that they hope it goes smoother. They don't even know their own rules, they prioritize their own profit over neglectful and terrible customer service. Incredibly frustrating and disappointing. The storage space under the seats was also very inconsistent so if you have a backpack within their sizing specs they provide, it may even fit under the space if you sit in the isle.

### "Never will I fly again"
The plane was delayed for 3 hours, they didn’t give us food or water! rescheduled 3 times the flight! Never will I fly again. I am so angry

### "useless in the customer service area"
Not Verified |  Absolutely useless in the customer service area. Tried to plan how I can be accommodated with my disability two weeks prior to my flight. I was told that they could accommodate my needs in terms of a free seat selection but never told how to go about arranging it. Three emails later, still no direction. Now I am stuck with a middle seat with a broken leg. Never again will I fly with this company. So frustrating.

### "more expensive than major airlines"
The flight was fine but the cost additions made this “low cost” airline more expensive than major airlines. It looks attractive upfront but don’t be fooled.

### "Everything went smoothly"
Not Verified |  Booked with Lynx Air on the new Los Angeles to Calgary route. Everything went smoothly and efficiently. Will be using lynx and this route a lot in the future.

### "disappointed in my experience and I haven't even left"
Only pay for what you want", "No hidden fees"....directly from the Lynx website. When booking I mistakenly selected carry-on baggage and paid the extra $40 with the purchase of the ticket. I realized I needed to have selected checked bags for $100 but there was no way to cancel or adjust online. I called customer care (which they charge you $20 every time you call) and they said all baggage fees are non-refundable. I explained I was not taking a carry-on, only a checked bag and the agent said "that's ok, you can leave your carry-on at home" but still pay for it...not sure how that makes any sense. Trying to be solution focused I thought it was reasonable to ask for a $40 voucher so that I could apply that to the $200 I would end up paying for a checked bag both ways. They said they were unable to do this. I honestly feel so bad for these customer service agents because their company does not give them any ability to resolve problems. So much for "only pay for what you want", looks like I'm paying $40 extra (on top of the $200!) for bags I'm not even bringing. I'm already so disappointed in my experience and I haven't even left yet.

### "Do not fly with Lynx"
Horrible experience with Lynx Air. I have flown with other discount airlines in the past, and dealt with minor delays, and am not a picky person when it comes to flights; if I get where I am going within a few hours the day I booked, I am a happy camper. And so, plethora of bad reviews and all, I thought I would give Lynx a chance for a trip from Vancouver to Calgary to visit family, as our dates/times were somewhat flexible, and I thought "how bad could it be"? My husband, 5 year old, and myself arrived with 2 hours to spare until boarding; and it was a good thing we did. I was flying with no photo ID, which is a bit inconvenient but which I have done plenty of times in the past, and am always careful to bring more ID examples than needed, and have never had an issue with any other airline. Nevertheless, I double checked our booking receipt and Lynx website, and under "Valid ID requirements" was relieved to see a link to the federal domestic flight identification requirements; literally a direct link to the Canada govt website. I have flown with North Air, Flair, Swoop, West Jet, and Air Canada with the same documents I brought with me this time. I expected the same experience I had with other airlines; a quick call to verify the documents, and then no issue. The "quick call" to verify my identification documents turned into a 30 minute wait. When someone finally called back, they shared that they would accept the 4 documents I brought (all examples of official and stamped provincial and federal documents, that all included my full name and date of birth) as one document. I asked how that was possible, as they were all completely different documents, and actually more identification needed than required by the Federal government for domestic air travel. She shrugged and (apologetically, I will admit) said "Lynx has different ID requirements, there is nothing I can do, but you could call customer service yourself". After another 30 minutes on hold, my son and 5 year old were at risk of missing the flight all together, and so i told them to go ahead, I would figure it out. I spend the next 20 minutes securing another form federal identification, to see if I could get on the flight with that in combination with the other documents. I went back to check in to see, and a different front desk person shared that Lynx had cancelled my flight due to the previous "ID issue", and that it was not reversible. No refund, not even for the checked back I paid an additional $70.00 for, nothing. You would think the story might end here. I went over to Westjet and booked and boarded a flight with no issue whatsoever, and they were flabbergasted that I had been denied boarding with the ID I had. I texted my husband the good(ish) news, I would be arriving in Calgary only 30 minutes after them, to hear back from him that the Lynx flight was now delayed, and he wasn't sure when they would be boarding. I joked that I might end up in Calgary before them, turned out it was not a joke! Lynx boarded all passengers onto the plane, and then further delayed the flight, keeping all passengers on board for just over 4.5 hours, with no food, no explanation, and a dixie cup of water about 3.5 hours in to the delay. I happily arrived in Calgary nearly 4 hours before them and waited at the airport. We cancelled our return flights. Do not fly with Lynx.

### "I would not recommend Lynx"
Not Verified |  This was my first time flying Lynx air. I paid 300$ for my bags (fine it’s a low cost airline) but After having a heck of a time trying to navigate the website for check-in. Which I had no luck. when I checked my bag, the lady at the kiosk had NO idea what was going on, calling her manager, claiming over the belt to the other lady to ask her something and then back again. I watched her place the tag on my bag and off it went. After boarding, she came on to check to see if one of our children were on the flight which I thought was odd. During our flight from Vancouver to Toronto, my husbands knee got rammed multiple times, elbowed in the head all by the flight attendants. Got to Toronto, after waiting over an hour for the bags to come out, everyone finally got their bags (one lady’s bags were on a different carousel) mine did not come out. I called and they opened a ticket . This was a week ago- with no updates from the airline for my lost/delayed bag. I got a call from Toronto Airport saying my bag was there for pickup. I had to go to Pearson, pick it up. Lynx never offered to reimburse my bag fee, deliver my bag. Not to mention, I have heard nothing from them in regards to my bag. Thought I have it now, and thankfully all the contents of it- no word. I would not recommend Lynx unless you’re just travelling with a purse. Even that would be risky.

### "I don't recommend Lynx"
Not Verified |  Bad experience with customer service. First they canceled my original flight and give me an option to choose different data that ruined my schedule, then I canceled the trip with them. No money back at all. I know it is cheap but is not worth to have headache in vacation. I don't recommend Lynx at all it is a scam company.

### "real explanation if possible"
Trying Lynx for 2nd time was not impressed with staff on flight. I realize hopefully 1/2 decent service on flight even with just water on flights. We paid extra for 2nd row seating and after noticing front row empty as my wife booked and paid for 2nd row, I inquired with staff just after take off that seeing front row not booked and was empty, if possible for two of us to move to front row with following reason. I have medical issues with my hip and recently with my shoulder injury is very painful and stretching it for the period on flight helps incredibly as previously paid for row one wth extra room. My wife saw only row two was avail online so booked it and once saw row one was not booked after we took off, I inquired with one of the staff members if we could move there after take off. All I got for an answer is No but you can move to middle or rear as few empty seats there. Tried inquiring why as we paid price for front or 2nd row to which I got no reason. Not impressed and just wanted to pass on for a real explanation if possible.

### "Terrible customer service"
Terrible customer service, staff was using threatening language and tone with things that could’ve been said in a simple kind way. I would rate this a 0/10 experience.

### "dinged me $100 for my checked baggage"
Save yourself. Unless you're flying with no luggage, it's a scam. They just dinged me $100 for my checked baggage at the airport for a one-way flight. Yet the cost of my flight was $60.

### "Not helpful, unresponsive"
Booked a flight ticket and was canceled right after. Didn't receive cancellation confirmation and full amount charged. Upon speaking to customer service penalizing for processing the cancellation. Not helpful, unresponsive and not listening at all. Ridiculous.

### "great experience for what I paid"
We had a 2 hour delay but the staff was kind and professional. The guy next to me took up his seat and half of my seat, but overall was a great experience for what I paid.

### "5 hour delay, no apology"
Cheap ticket but add on fees for everything. Website does not update delayed flights, airport crew didn't know either. Delay, delay, delay - 5 hour delay, no apology, no explanation.

### "crew seems tired and annoyed"
Not Verified | Oh man, where to start. Well at no fault of their own from Halifax our departure was delayed by 3 hours due to weather conditions in Toronto, but we finally got on the plane and departed at 10:40pm, original time was 7:15pm. This flight crew was reasonable and although the seats were uncomfortable, the flight was packed and overall everyone was tired this was not the fault of the flight crew. That being said, when we landed in Toronto, we were informed that we had to taxi to another gate because Air Canada was at ours? not sure how that just happens. So, about 30 minutes later, we finally see the doors open, and people start deboarding, and a new flight crew shows up. Meanwhile we are already very delayed and the current flight crew seems tired and annoyed, one of the stewardesses even shouted at the new crew, "you going to just stand there or you gonna help" grooming the interior. Finally this new crew gets off their butts and starts doing something I guess. They are taking their sweet time just joking around, being useless to be honest. Then the Toronto people start boarding, keep in mind, we are already late by almost 5 hours, so you'd think everyone who was needing to board would be there chomping at the bit to get on the plane. We wait seriously an hour and a half to board the plane, they are waiting for some people who apparently can't use watch (last time I was late for a flight, it left without me, as it should have). By now the Halifax folks heading to Calgary are getting very frustrated, it's the middle of the night and we have been sitting in this cramped plane for hours not moving. Oh and did I mention this whole time they are repeating the "prohibited to smoke" announcement, every 10 minutes, which is for some reason needed to be blasted at an unruly decibel considering the time of night. Then this guy gets on the mic and starts thanking everyone for their patience, especially the folks from Toronto, because yah you know Toronto is the center of the uni. No, snacks this whole time, 2 rounds of a dixie cup of water for what ended up being over 8 hours in the airplane. Some kid is puking in the seats beside us and they just give him a bucket. The one thing I have to admit was that the pilot did a great job, flawless take off/landing, spot on. I seriously would rather saw off my arm then do this flight again, I will gladly pay the additional $500 so that I don't have to endure the sheer annoyance of everything that had to do with this flight.

### "The line was gigantic"
Not Verified | We arrived 3 hours before the check-in. The line was gigantic. They had issues to check-in and we lost the flight. They simply didn't care the staff said they could not do anything - appalling!! !

### "Lynx isn't a great idea"
Saving a few bucks to fly Lynx isn't a great idea. We arrived at Lynx counter (Vancouver Y9107 March 2 2023) 40 minutes before flight time. Strange that this is a domestic flight but they put their check-in counter in the international flights section. Not a soul around. Yes we are in the right spot, checked with information counter. Couldn't get ahold of anyone so stayed overnight. So decided to give them (Lynx) another chance and booked Lynx again for the next day. Costs to date: hotel 205, cab 50 , new tickets including 2 checked bags 363, additional charge because carry-on to large 75. Total cost 693 plus original booking of 182. (Total 875)plus a lost day. Large carry on was ok on all other 7 legs of this holiday but not with Lynx. One month holiday (Calgary to Thailand) 1st leg WestJet - perfect 2nd and 3rd leg EVA air - perfect, 4th and 5th leg Bangkok Air - perfect, 6th and 7th leg EVA air - perfect, 8th leg Lynx - not so perfect.

### "staff is inexperienced and poorly trained"
Outbound: Took us an hour and half of waiting in line to check our bags (ski equipment and baby gear) and get boarding passes at Los Angeles International. Boarding gate was located in a different terminal, so more time taken to get there. Despite our timely arrival at airport, we barely had time to pick up some food for the trip (Lynx is a very budget operation). Flight was then delayed another 40 minutes after boarding because passenger count could not be verified. Return: We arrived at airport with all our ski equipment plus a toddler, stroller, carseat and thought we were clever to unload right under the Lynx sign at Calgary Airport. No such luck. We were told by other passengers to wait an hour. Someone else came by and told us that Lynx was doing check-in at the other end of the terminal. Even the info person at the airport did not know where Lynx was. Quite an inconvenient expedition with luggage and child. We had to have yet another protracted discussion with the agent about whether we'd prepaid for all our luggage. She ended up overcharging us and I will have to follow up on that. Plane ran an hour late. This is a new airline; staff is inexperienced and poorly trained.

### "I would definitely fly with them again"
My granddaughter and i recently flew with Lynx Air, was a little nervous because if bad reviews but I’m always willing to give someone a chance. Our flight was delayed 40 mins but no big deal, we went through security no issues then just sat around, but we got to our destination a few minutes early than was expected which was a bonus. As long as you are aware its a bare bones airplane, no food or onboard entertainment. Seats were comfortable enough, it was very clean and attendants were very pleasant to deal with. Just make sure you print your boarding pass off when you get to the airport, we didn’t so it took us longer to board and we paid for priority boarding, so i wasted my money, my error for not checking this ahead of time. What I liked is they boarded a few rows at a time so there wasn’t a pile up of people standing in the rows. I would definitely fly with them again.

### "Terrible service"
I arrived to check my bags 1 hour and 20 minutes before BOARDING and 2 hours before DEPARTURE. The two staff at the check-in counter would not check our bags. It took them 30 minutes to check 4 bags and then they said they would not check anyone else’s. Terrible service and the only bad experience about my trip to Toronto. Do better and hold those staff accountable for not checking the bags of 5 more passengers.

### "They wasted a lot of time"
Not Verified |  The worst experience ever with this airline. They wasted a lot of time. During flight I asked the flight attendant 3 times to bring a glass of water. Every time she told me that they would soon provide it. I got a glass of water after almost 2 hours. I would not travel in the future with this airline.

### "said they couldn’t provide refund"
Not Verified |  Changed flight prior to fly out where I needed to fly out to a conference. No suitable options forced me to cancel. They said they couldn’t provide refund. When talking to manager they said refund would be issued for full price. Then they gave a 21$ voucher. Called back, then they provided a 21$ refund. Still waiting on my correct refund where they have told me they issued it already but cannot provide any proof. Learn from my mistake don’t fly with this company, they tempt you with low prices but you get what you pay for.

### "disregard for my time"
Ridiculous that we waited until 10 before departure to get an update on the status of our flight. Lots of laughter and joking behind the service counter while hundreds of people wait in disbelief as the crew starts to charge for Carry on baggage. Would have rather paid 100$ and been treated respectfully than save 60$ and put in last place for basic updates on flight plan. As it sits now we will be delayed at least 30 minutes with very little advisory comments. Thanks for saving me some money, but no thanks for your disregard for my time.

### "beyond expectations"
Great job! Finally found an airline that is very reasonably priced, beyond expectations really and is so very efficient and totally professional! 100% satisfied and will ALWAYS book with Lynx!!! Everyone should try Lynx - you will not be disappointed!

### "Worst airline I’ve ever flown"
Worst airline I’ve ever flown. They have been at least 6+ hours late now on three separate flights. Latest flight was an 11 hour delay. They always state that the delay is due to “safety reasons” to avoid taking responsibility and paying out compensation. Take this airline only if you don’t want to get to your destination.

### "staff and service are first rate"
OK, so the flight was delayed a few hours but given the appalling weather conditions that was only to be expected. Lynx Air however gave us regular email updates so we could plan our day and not waste hours waiting at the airport. The staff were friendly and helpful and our flight crew actually worked on their day off to ensure we could “take the cat” to Calgary. This is unapologetically a no frills airline but the planes, staff and service are first rate. I really couldn’t give them a better rating. Lynx Air is exactly what the Canadian airline industry needs and I wish then every success.

### "Nice brand new airplane"
Our first time flying with Lynx, Feb 1 2023. Great staff friendly as heck. Nice brand new airplane. We were a little late leaving but that's due to de icing time and airport congestion. Temp in Edmonton was -20C and snowing. I'm definitely going to consider them when I book my next flight. Price was competitive.

### "Below average flight"
Not Verified |  Below average flight and the flight from both ends started and ended almost 1.5 hours late. No information given to passengers regarding bags. Don’t recommend this flight.

### "don't recommend this company"
Checking in luggage was problematic. The flight was very comfortable but the staff who constantly ask you to buy. Luggage on arrival it took more than hour which is unacceptable, especially for those who are in kiosk very worst customer service by manager. The flight staff was very good but again the manager on that day was too bad. I don't recommend this company.

### "avoid this airline at all costs"
Please avoid this airline at all costs. It's not even the service or poor quality planes, it's their reliability. They are constantly delayed because of "Staff shortages" and have very poor communication with their customers. By far the worst airline I've flown with in over 30 years. Shockingly bad

### "Very poor customer service"
Not Verified |  Very poor customer service, the airline does not have a customer service kiosk, there is no boarding Pass machines for check out, the app is not responsive as well. The flight was canceled due to not having an agent or employee in the Airport. I do not recommend flying with this airline!

### "stand in the line for 2 hours"
We checked in online along with our checked baggage. In order to check in our checked baggage we stand in the line for 2 hours and when we reached the counter they closed it with about 40 people in the line behind us. They did not give any explanation. I felt like I am in a 3rd world country. We had to call someone to take our luggage back and rush to the gates.

### "I was pleasantly surprised with my flight"
Not Verified |  I was on an early morning flight from Calgary to Hamilton. The gate attendant was polite and professional. The boarding process easy and quick. The flight attendants were friendly and helpful. We left a few minutes late due to one of the flight attendants arriving late, but actually arrived in Hamilton bang on time. I was aware that no food or drink is served so brought my own. (They do come around with water shortly after take-off and again before landing). No charging ports, so I brought a portable charger just in case. I did not check a bag or bring a carry on, only a largish tote that fit under the seat in front of me. I was pleasantly surprised with my flight. On time, clean and quiet and cheap. Will def fly Lynx again.

### "check in staff were absolutely rude"
Not Verified |  When we flew out of Victoria the staff were amazing, we had one check bag and 1 personal bag which we get for free, so no additional fees. The whole experience from Victoria to Calgary was amazing. But on the return, Calgary to Victoria it was absolutely horrible, the check in staff were rude, and charged us for our personal bag. When booking we are told to be there 3 hours early, so we did. Only to find out the check was closed, we had to wait for an hour. So check wasn't open until 2 hours before take off. The check in staff were absolutely rude. I am not sure I would fly with them again, yes it's great savings but I rather pay more then deal with rude condescending staff.

### "plane was very dirty"
Not Verified |  We will never use this airline again! The plane was very dirty when we boarded, the flight was delayed for over 3 hours, and they lost our luggage. We paid over 200 for our luggage so the airfare turns out to be more expensive than Air Canada. We'd rather fly Air Canada in the future.

### "pretty impressed with their product quality"
Flight departed on time and landed about 30 minutes early at the destination. Customer service was good and friendly at the gate. Seat was comfortable albeit a touch narrow (I am 6’2” and about 220 pounds). Flight attendants were professional and kept everything moving. This is now the third time I have flown with them on this route and am pretty impressed with their product quality considering the cost. A welcome new addition to the Canadian airline industry.

### "refused to check us in"
Our return flight was delayed for 1 hour and 30 minutes. We reached more than 2 hours before our scheduled time to check in. The lady at the lynx check in desk refused to check us in. We were family of 5 people, three small kids. They were at least 10 to 15 people asking the lady to check in. She refused to help us or give number to contact anyone. She said that we were supposed to be at least 45 minutes before our original scheduled time. We tried calling the customer service, without any luck. The lady was extremely rude. She said she will be "screamed at" if she talked to the supervisor or help with anything. We all went to the airport information desk. The lady was so nice to call them and ask talk to her manager and ask the lynx airline crew to let everyone check in. After 1 and half hour of such headache, we were finally be able to board on the flight. Hopefully, they could improve their customer services.

### "this was disgusting"
The flight out was great! However on the way back the flight was missed. I'll be honest and say that Security was crazy so it took sometime. But as a frequent flyer I'm always just a little early. I got to the gate at the end if it all about 30 minutes before boarding. When at the gate I then watched staff closing the door for my flight. I then proceeded to try and ask the lady if the flight times changed but I was just ingored. So I then called in to find out. The male I spoke to was really rude! Would not let me talk and explain what happen he just kept saying over and over the gate is closed 15 minutes before boarding and he will put a note on my file. Then hangs up on me, okay yes you get what you pay for but this was disgusting. I'll definitely be even uploading a picture of my ticket and a picture of the time at the gate to back this up.

### "$57 for my standard sized backpack"
I am all for low cost airlines and being able to get to just point A to Point B with bare minimum. After taking almost hundred flights on a combination of Flair and Swoop, I wanted to give Lynx a try. And that was a disappointment. My flight from YYZ to YVR was almost 8 hours delayed and the airlines website kept showing flight status On Time until 1 hour prior to flight. It was initially delayed 5 hours and then 2.5 hours more. There were no vouchers or anything offered for this delay. They didn't make any fuss about the backpack I was carrying on my way to Vancouver. Yes, I knew that they are strict with sizes and even though I have flown with this exact backpack with both Flair and Swoop earlier this year, I was still careful to take the minimum amount of stuff so I can make it to their ridiculous sizing requirement. My way back from Vancouver the gate agents started calling everyone to visually measure the sizes of personal item and started charging random amount for the items people were carrying. Again they did it visually without any actual calculation. They charged me $57 for my standard sized backpack when I saw another person getting charged $51 right in from of me. When I brought it up that they didn't say anything on the way from Toronto, their answer is head office asks us to do it and we do it on YVR. After I said it was my trial flight with them and just not gonna book with them anymore, even though my husband had a backpack which is almost similar if not larger than the size of mine, they decided they are gonna stop with charging one instead of 2. No explanation, no proper breakdown of why and how they are charging the amount. Summary is if you have option and even if it costs you $10- $15 dollars more, choose the other low cost ones. You would atleast have the sanity and won't have to deal with these hassles.

### "made me feel at ease"
I decided to give Lynx a try over the Christmas holidays. The staff were the perfect mix of fun & professional, dressed so sharply and they made me feel at ease (I’m a nervous passenger). They were reminiscent of the early days of WestJet’s staff. I knew what to expect as far as refreshments and entertainment go (absolutely nothing), and I couldn’t charge my devices. Lynx remind guests to bring an empty water bottle to fill past security and to bring a power bank or a book to read. Anyway the flight was smooth, I slept the whole way. Thinking it may have just been pure luck how well my first flight with them went, I was prepared for the flight home to be as bad as the reviews. It wasn’t. It was just as good as the first flight. I was awake for this one and found the staff personable yet professional.

### "Will definitely use them again"
Not Verified |  Booked the flight online, all good. Left Dec 26 from Vancouver to Toronto via Edmonton with no issue. Returned Dec 30 December all good and on time. I paid for carry on luggage which is expected. Excellent price and customer service. Will definitely use them again.

### "unacceptable, heavily disappointed"
When I booked the flight, Lynx asked me to pay more than 11 CAD to send me an SMS or email to remind me. But you DID NOT. I left everything behind me to appear at the airport on time. And, my flight was delayed without any announcements. According to the email that I complained about the delay without any announcements to let me know. I have been waiting for more than 8 hrs until the fight took off at 7:23 PM (Edmonton time). So, this is your fault, not mine, I sent you an email regarding this issue, provided all relevant info, and the airline keeps DELAYING the resolution process. Moreover, Lynx air also did not reply to my email. Why? This was unacceptable, heavily disappointed.

### "they add one stop in Edmonton"
Worst airline, after 15 hours I will reach from Vancouver to Toronto. I booked direct flight from Vancouver to Toronto, they add one stop in Edmonton without my consent. I advice you not to book this airline in future.

### "They don’t seem to give a damn"
They took us from Calgary and we were supposed to go to Kelowna. We are now in Vancouver and no one can tell us when the next flight is to Kelowna. Meanwhile I have heard 3 other flights go to Kelowna. They don’t seem to give a damn. Plus the fight attendant is arrogant - I tried to tell him that I can’t sit in the seat I was given because I am crippled and it is the emergency exit. He cuts me off, twice and tells me to go to said seat. Later I am told I can’t sit there for the reason I tried to tell him. I suffer from chronic pain so it all was difficult all around and pointless if he just listened to what i was told to tell him. Now I’m sat in Vancouver for the 4th hour waiting for a flight to the original destination. Never use this airline!

### "the experience had no bad surprises"
This was my third flight on Lynx and I've been pleasantly surprised on each. Lynx seems to be focused on running a barebones airline and doing it well. Our flights were all on time, and the experience had no bad surprises. The seats on our plane were not that bad, although they did not recline. Subscribe to their email newsletter to get deep discounts sent to you every week. Anyway, they compare favorably to Flair in most ways and I will be favouring Lynx over Flair if I have a choice.

### "who knows when (and if) you'll actually arrive at your destination"
We thought it was great that we could fly with such a budget friendly airline and pay for only the services we needed. We didn't mind the "bare bones" of this airline - they warn you they have no wifi, no charging ports, entertainment, no reclining seats, and no food or beverages on these flights so that is no shock. However, we flew Calgary to Toronto and back both with Lynx. Both flights were delayed. The first flight, the pilot even said the plane had been sitting all day on the tarmac in -28 weather and was covered in ice and snow. Once on the flight (not before which would have been the smart thing to check) we had to wait for maintenance to fix the lavatory before take off. After that was fixed, then the pilot attempted to start the engines and one could not be started (you'd think in a Canadian winter you'd see if the aircraft would start before guests are loaded onto the plane, kind of like checking if your car will start in the frigid cold before embarking on a trip). After waiting for the lavatory to be fixed, and no success with starting the engines, we were de-planed, and had to wait several hours until we could get a new plane. On our return trip, I received no emails that our flight was delayed (not by a huge amount) however, it ended up being nearly 2 hours of a delay, all while there were no updates, not even on the airport monitors. My seat unfortunately was right at the back of the plane where the flight attendants reside in the back for most of the trip (they have no food or beverages to serve so they just chatted back there) and they were loud. Obnoxiously loud. I heard every detail of their weekend plans, their rowdy escapades in Vegas, some good book recommendations, and some foul language. On a very late, delayed flight when most are trying to get some shut eye, and the plane is silent, this was the nail in the coffin for me. I found this very unprofessional. In short, if you're looking for a cheap airline, this is it! But don't make any solid itinerary plans because who knows when (and if) you'll actually arrive at your destination.

### "a no nonsense flying package"
Lynx Air has been superb from booking to check-in and first leg YVR to YYC. Every single touchpoint and service experience has been wonderful. It's a no nonsense flying package given the competitive prices and their website and client service teams provide thorough explanations on what clients should expect from baggage types to onboard services. Their pricing is unbeatable especially if you book in advance. I was a bit taken aback by the ground staff at YYC. The staff were particularly very loud and off-putting (literally yelling and laughing at each other) I'm not being critical of their merry making but I found their conduct and behaviour to be quite unprofessional. These staff members should be trained to conduct themselves more professionally.

### "not recommend or fly with this airline again"
Not Verified |  Decided to use this airline that does not serve food or drink which was acceptable as our flight was only a few hours. Unfortunately they had a flight attendant “get sick” and decided to hold the plane an hour plus while waiting for someone to cover, (this is after boarding everyone) for an airline that doesn’t have any on-board services delaying an entire flight of people for over an hour to have another person come in and do nothing is terrible costumer service as one flight attendant should not take priority over getting people to their destination Will not recommend or fly with this airline again.

### "fail in actually flying you anywhere"
I believe this is an airline entirely designed to take money from people who do not have a great deal of it. This is the second time flying with lynx. The first time I had to cancel my lynx flight due to last minute alterations (alterations that extended my travel time well into the following day) and instead had to pay far more than I had originally intended by booking a proper real airline flight with WestJet at a far greater price than had I originally booked with WestJet in the first place. I am now, having booked a flight with lynx for a flight for tomorrow am facing the difficulty of having my flight delayed by 3 hours. This delay is not due to weather, it is simply due to the fact that lynx can barely sustain of airline. The delay has nothing to do with weather, it is just because it is barely an airline and will not last beyond 2023 because their customer service is non existent. They just want to take money and cancel your flight. I already had the disturbing email a month ago that the simply pushed my flight 30 hours forward. I now believe I will not get there at all, following the 2nd time delay of 3 hours. I will miss the connection. I have now thrown away hundreds of dollars on a trip that will not get me to where I need to be, therefore will just stay at home. Never book with lynx airline. It seems cheap but, it is exactly that. It will take your money, bleed you dry and fail in actually flying you anywhere.

### " Great experience from gate to gate"
Great experience from gate to gate. We showed up from our flight 3 hours early with 2 snowboards heading out for snowboard training. We left Toronto early and arrived to Vancouver early on the brand new 737MAX8. We were worried about our snowboards making it so a very friendly flight attendant named Cheri went above and beyond to verify our bags had in fact made it on the plane. Great staff, smooth flight and we will definitely be flying with Lynx Air again on our future snowboard adventures. Thanks Cheri and staff for making our flight enjoyable.

### "I was really impressed"
#9989; Trip Verified |  Flights in both directions left on time and landed slightly early. Staff was friendly and had no issues with anything at all. Took a backpack as a free carry-on. Flight attendants were professional, helpful and friendly. For the cost of a ticket I was really impressed. I like that the seats don’t recline which is something that bothers me on other airlines as it really reduces the free space in front of me. The seats themselves were comfortable and I have no complaint about them either. Legroom was alright (I am over 6 feet tall and still had room for my knees). There is really nothing I can complain about. They met every expectation I had.

### "this was an excellent choice"
For the price this was an excellent choice. They got me there and back without a hitch. On time both directions. No frills airline and friendly staff. Read the baggage rules before getting upset!

### "It is such a bad service"
Trying this new Lynx Airline. It only started operational this April. Book and fairly cheap flight to Vancouver. Moment got the gate. I was right away ask for payment of my personal item as a carry on baggage. Although my bag is not that big compare to some of passengers of bulky backpack. My personal baggage was a small bag that fits underneath the chair and no need to put in the overhead bin. It is such a bad service and from gate crew giving bad attitude and not even polite to customers. Paying $41.99 carry-on fee that should have been free as personal item. I understand to pay a carry-on if my item is too bulky and big backpack. I have posted a photo of how it looks like under the seat putting my small bag not bulky compare to other big backpacks. I even saw other passenger didn't have to pay extra charge of $41.99 even their personal item is much bigger than mine. Thought to say this in this review as some whom are trying to take this airline could experience similar thing as me.

### "Worst experience with this airline"
Worst experience with this airline, decided to give them a shot and I would not recommend to anyone who may be thinking the same. Flight delayed 6 hours and cited for “safety reasons” to avoid compensating passengers. Did not have the courtesy of providing a $10 voucher for food while waiting (commonly done by other airlines). Wouldn’t recommend and wouldn’t fly again.

### "want to compliment all the ground crew"
I want to compliment all the ground crew, and the flight staff, both coming and going from Toronto to Edmonton on flight Y9502 and Y9501, with all there help with my disabled wife. They even re-arranged the seating for us, so that my wife would be closer to the Lavatory, and they did everything in there power to help her there when she needed. The flight staff did everything to make her feel comfortable on both flights. A big thanks, also to the Captain on our flight to Edmonton, he even went out to go and find ground crew to get my wife seated, now that is service. I wish I knew all there names, as I would mention them here. We left Sept 23rd Y9-502 and return to Toronto Y9-501 Oct12th. I hope the powers that be let them know how much I appreciate all there help on the flights. Will definitely fly with Lynx again when I go out to Alberta.

### "not worth the saving"
Very bad airline. Try to avoid it. It not worth the saving. The flight is delayed. The service people shows they do not care. You need to pay for your carry on bag. The definition of free carry on, 6 by 14 by 11. Basically a computer bag. Server staff is rude.

### "No customer service help at the airport"
At first we were pleasantly surprised at the cost of the flight when booking, online reservation went off without a hitch until we received an email a few days later saying our flight was cancelled for no reason. No explanation was provided. An alternate flight was provided for the day after. We made an attempt to call customer service same day to reserve our one way flight. Finally after waiting 1.5 hrs on the phone we got through. Booked our flight and set on our trip. As we get to the airport we realized the flight that was booked was in fact for the original date of yesterday! No customer service help at the airport, no help over the phone and now we’re left stranded in the airport rebooking a flight online at a much higher cost and no form of compensation for the miscommunication. Everything in the airport is third party, and customer service had no consideration for their initial mistake. Needless to say this is the first and absolute last time flying with Lynx. Rather pay more money for consistency with a major airline. I sincerely hope they consider hiring managers for customer service before this airline goes down.

### "Had a great experience"
Not Verified |  Had a great experience. Flight was early, no issues at all with boarding. Keep in mind they only allow a small carry on and backpack. Crew was very nice. This was the first flight where I could actually be able to fall asleep!

### "I was pleasantly surprised"
I paid $170 for a round trip from Calgary to Toronto (gone for 5 days) which is a fantastic price. I didn’t have the highest hopes for this airline given the price but I was pleasantly surprised! The flight crew was lovely, the seats were spacious and the same as any other airline. They don’t serve food, pop , etc which is fine I just brought my own. There’s no in flight entertainment which was fine as I downloaded shows in advance. I also totally understand given the price why all this isn’t included, fair trade off. In addition the only thing to keep in mind is they only allow a very small purse or backpack to be brought on free of charge. If you bring a carry on i think its $40 and a checked bag is $100 so the whole point is to avoid that. I had a wonderful experience overall and will 100% be using this airline again!

### "Our flight was cancelled"
Our flight was cancelled by the airline as a result of a crew shortage but they did not make us aware until we arrived at the airport. As a result we needed to pay an unreasonable amount of money to get home that day or wait three days for the flight we were rescheduled on by Lynx. In addition to all of this they are only offering to reimburse half of what we paid. This is my first and last experience with Lynx and I would highly advise against anyone flying with them. I get that they're a ultra discount carrier and this prices may seem appealing but if they're going to cancel your flight without notice leaving you high and dry then it is no longer worth it. I've flown on many other discount carriers and none are even close to as bad and poorly organized as Lynx.

### "most irresponsible airline"
Not Verified | Calgary to Toronto. They are the most irresponsible airline to fly, they change your flights for no reason, they do not answer you for your additional expenses that are caused by them. I have a canceled flight from Toronto to Calgary for 2 additional days paying for hotel food and losing days of work with a budget that was not in my plans. The worst and I will never travel with them again nor will I recommend them to anyone.

### "their customer service was not available"
Well, my friend and I were flying from Calgary to Toronto. Our flight was scheduled to depart at around 7 and we reached the airport very early at around 5. To our astonishment the Lynx check in services told us that our flight got cancelled with zero explanation why, no cancellation email as well. Lynx did not even take the effort to rebook us on to another flight and their customer service was not available. My friend and I had to scramble to find another flight ourselves to Kitchener airport spending an extra 628 dollars in all and not to mention the extra Uber cost that we may incur later. Totally frustrated with this airline, they have zero sense of accountability or professionalism and I will never take this airline again. I wish there was a way to give a negative score to this airline. Absolutely horrendous.

### "I would highly recommend Lynx Air"
Not Verified |  Calgary to Kelowna and return, tax in for $147.00. We left Calgary on time and arrived early. Brand new plane, no bells and whistles. No food or beverage service. I would guess to keep the cost down. The only negative, they did change my flight time later the same day as I was checking in. I was sent a notification indicating the change and a hour later was 24 hour check in. Please check the time of departure on your boarding pass once you check in. Over all it was a great experience. I would highly recommend Lynx Air.

### "this airline is not operationally ready to operate yet"
Here are the facts from my experience, take it or leave it. My flight was cancelled and I received no email or communication to inform me. This was true for about 100 other people at the airport when I arrived. The airline offered no apology or explanation and rebooked me for 3 days later. We were offered no credit or accommodation to cover this extended travel. I was told that I might be able to get in a flight the following day but the only way to know was to come back to the airport. I waited in line for 45 minutes the next day only to be told there was no record of my flight in the system. The employee at the airport had to call tech support to resolve this but eventually got me on the flight. Based on the line of a hundred people or so I’d guess this also happened to many others. I have never experienced this level of distinction and feel bad for the employees on the front lines who have to deal with this. It is really unfortunate but this airline is not operationally ready to operate yet. I would stay away unless you have the ability to have very flexible travel plans.

### "ridiculous and unprofessional"
Calgary to Victoria. We had booked a flight in May 2022 for October 2022 at 7:50pm. We had also received SEVERAL confirmation emails the days leading up to our flight that all said 7:50pm. When we showed up to the desk just before 6:00pm (almost 2 hours before our flight) to find another 20 people also waiting and the employee at the desk said “the flight just left” 2 HOURS EARLY. The worst part was he didn’t give us any answers as to why, because it must of been empty. And then he said he was leaving. So we waited at the desk for 3 hours to hear from someone with some answers and to why that happened and how and what they’ll do to get us all home. Nothing. The best answer we got was “contact customer service” which I have been on hold for hours with. I’m convinced no one works for this airline, it’s a scam and it’s a coverup for some other type of business. This is ridiculous and unprofessional. I will NEVER fly with them again and will make sure everyone I know will never fly with them again.

### "cancelled by email 1.5 hrs before takeoff"
I thought I would try this flight to Halifax. outbound, no issues. inbound, whole different ballgame. Flight cancelled by email, 1.5 hrs before takeoff, as we were clearing security! Arrived to find we had no flight - email stated "due to bad weather". Zero bad weather, coast to coast. Lynx staff then told me pilot, on a Sunday afternoon, "suddenly got sick". Apparently that's means there's no other pilots? we were rescheduled 3 days later so we had to buy tickets on Swoop to Edmonton, and then take a taxi to Calgary to be able to get back to work, as all other flights fully booked, stranded 3000kms from home. This was my first, and will utterly be my last flight with Lynx. How do you rate a return flight, that doesn't return?

### "puzzling and unacceptable behaviour"
Not Verified | We live far outside of any major city center, we booked Lynx to fly us to Calgary for our friends birthday in Banff. We drove 3 hours to the airport arrived 40 minutes before our flight due to issues with our vehicle. The women at the front desk refused to allow us boarding passes, we remained calm the entire time while she was incredible rude and would not allow us to get a word in and kept cutting us off, to the point she caused my partner to cry and she had to step away. They would not allow us boarding passes even with just our personal items. We called customer service and they informed us that they are not liable for their staff treatment off it's customers or whether or not we get on the plane if we do not arrive 2 hours before a domestic flight. It was honestly the most puzzling and unacceptable behaviour from a business and from all employees involved, I don't usually write reviews but my experience without even seeing the plane today honestly made me search out and find somewhere I could share the story. Just spend the extra money to get one of the other budget airlines with empathy

### "it is amazingly good"
Flew Lynx first time. And surprisingly it is amazingly good. The flight was super clean, staff was great and the flight was right on time which unusual with the low cost airlines. Reading the other reviews, I think it is not fair to judge them based on the luggage. If you want a quick backpack trip, there is no better airlines so far. The only recommendation I would give is if Lynx reduces the add on luggage cost, it would be ideal. Looking at this as a whole package, it would not make sense to pay 90$ for the flight and 60$ for the luggage. No food and beverages are sold on the flight, it would be nice if there is an option to buy it. Sometimes passengers might get hungry suddenly, specially kids.

### "Don’t waste your time nor your money"
This is the worst airline ever. Don’t waste your time nor your money because this airline will disappoint you. I flew on more than 10 Airlines and definitely this is the worst. I booked for my mom to visit me in Edmonton for a family emergency. They delayed her flight twice and then they ended up closing the boarding counter earlier than the timeframe they mentioned in their ticket. She arrived almost 2 hours early to find no staff there to talk to. Many other people faced the same situation and the other airline staff were there to assure them but not them. My mom's diabetes had raised from the tension and more serious consequences will happen due to their action.

### "Would definitely recommend this airline"
Would definitely recommend this airline. We arrived in Calgary on time and back to Toronto. The staff were friendly and flight crew were fantastic. We were somewhat nervous because of the issues with luggage but we had no issues. The price you could not beat. We will definitely fly with this airline again. Thanks for the great experience.

### "seats were clean and comfortable"
Great flight! Will fly again and recommend. Our return flight was mildly delayed but they worked very hard to make up for lost time. Staff were great and seats were clean and comfortable.

### "will certainly be flying with them again"
Not Verified |  We flew out from St Johns just prior to the Atlantic Canada “Fiona” storm. Being a little nervous if flying anyway this made me more so. I cannot say enough good things about the crew on this flight. They were excellent. They checked on me several times and even sat down and had a chat with me. Keep up the great work and thanks so much. This is my second time with Lynx and I cannot say enough good about them. I will certainly be flying with them again.

### "did not lose my luggage"
Lynx Air took off on time, arrived on time, and did not lose my luggage. What more could any traveller ask.

### "Great new airline"
My flights were on time. We left early morning from Calgary arrived in Toronto 15 minutes early. Staff were friendly. Return trip was also on time ~ again early departure and arrived 10 minutes early. Great new airline wanted to give a shout out. The price was great too. Thanks Lynx. You’ll see me again.

### "Everything was excellent"
Everything was excellent. Plane was clean and cabin crew friendly and helpful. A heartfelt thank you to Jay and Dominique for helping me with my flight from St. John's to Toronto. I'm a nervous flyer and was extremely nervous with the storm (hurricane) in St. John's when we were departing on Sept 11. They were both so good with me. So caring and patient, even sitting to talk to me and assure me that there were no problems with the flying conditions, and checking in on me often. I've never experienced flight crew so attentive and caring.

### "my experience with Lynx was outstanding"
For a budget airline, my experience with Lynx was outstanding. With no first class or in flight tvs, I felt as though the seats were more spacious when compared to economy on competing airlines. I fly quite frequently, at this price point it will be my first choice flying domestic from now on. Two Flight Attendants really stood out to me: Meg and Robyn on flight Y9504 YHZ-YYC. Their kindness, friendliness, and outgoing personalities made me feel both welcomed and safe. They went above and beyond to accommodate my needs and answered all of my questions. Great staff and exceptional service. I will definitely be flying with Lynx again soon!

### "never felt so humiliated"
Not Verified |  Lynx Air has held on to my Wheelchair for 2 days now. I am Physically Challenged, I cannot walk or stand. I flew Lynx Air from Toronto to Halifax 09/15/2022 and they refused to allow me fly with my motorized wheelchair; say its against their Airline policy. They held on to my Chair in Toronto; I am back to Halifax 2days now without my mobility aid. I have never felt so humiliated, dehumanized; I am distraught.

### "We will be flying Lynx again"
Not Verified |  Excellent service for a new airline! My husband and I didn’t realize that we were not able to get off the plane at Toronto so didn’t bring any real food. The cabin crew over heard and made sure we were watered and fed! We were able to walk around the plane before the new passengers boarded. The cabin crew were extremely professional and friendly. We will be flying Lynx again!

### "Don’t get this flight please"
I came from Toronto to Vancouver and I have had a oversized bag and also I paid $200 roughly for it. They didn’t give me receipt and they told me we will email you and they didn’t do that so my bag is lost and when I arrived to Vancouver I didn’t get it and reported in oversized luggage station and the person told me you will get your bag next day or next two days for sure. Right now after 4 days nobody care about it and doesn’t answer me clearly I don’t know what should I do (I have had expensive things in my bag). I had suggestion this flight to all my friends and my family before and I regret. Don’t get this flight please.

### "they do not issue refunds"
The worst. Tried to cancel after 28 of booking ticket and they do not issue refunds. They give you a voucher. I can't use the voucher as they don't fly to where I live. Horrible customer service.

### "Really disappointing"
Not Verified |  I travelled 2nd august 2022 from Toronto to Vancouver they left our luggage behind in Toronto airport. I was flying back to Toronto on 16th august and told them to deliver my luggage to Toronto. Its been more then month, no update, their customer service is really bad - tried to call them every 2nd day they have no information about anything. Really disappointing and horrible experience.

### "Customer service is very bad"
Vancouver to Toronto. They are marketing lower price and then they are charging you 100$ extra for carry on bag for the round trip. So in the end, it is the same with other bigger airplane companies. Customer service is very bad.

### "ould fly with them again"
Brilliant, no issues at all. After reading reviews I was a little nervous but I can honestly say after flying out with another airline a few days before and taking this carrier back - they were hands down better than the national carrier. Check in desks opened a little over 3 hours before, 3 desks and signage so easy to find. Couldn't use the electronic monitors but that's OK because we'd already checked in online. Very nice staff, checked in our 1 bag and off it went. In bound plane was a few mins late but boarding started 10 mins early. Pushed off early. Good flight times, very happy friendly cabin crew. No in-flight entertainment or food avaliable for purchase but we knew this so didn't care. They even made an announcement warning you prior to boarding to give you time to purchase. *they did offer bottled water twice on the flight. We had a spare seat on our row and there were loads of seats empty and people moved around to be comfortable. Arrived slightly early in Vancouver. Disembarked easily, probably due to less annoyingly sized cabin bags and people sneaking on more than they're allowed. Bag took 10mins to come on carousel. Easy as. Would fly with them again! Very happy.

### "$62 to check a small bag"
Not Verified |  Described as a discount airline, but it costs $62 to check a small bag and $33 for a carry on, one way. So Calgary to Vancouver return costs $200 just for the small bags. Flights were changed many times, by over 24 hours and even last minute. This required staying at a hotel and extra night and since my hotel was full, staying at multiple hotels. There is no compensation for these changes or even a perk like "free bag". It's a roll of the dice to fly with this airline that only calls itself discount because it has some cheap flights at times. At the end of the day, Canada does not have any cheap airlines and the service at all of them is quite poor. Air staff were rude. After having my ticket checked at the gate (where you get on the plane), I packed it away. On the plane, I was asked by a staff member where I was sitting. I told them the seat number and she said she didn't believe me and wouldn't let me sit unless I could prove I had a ticket m. As if I somehow snuck onto the plane. She sighed and got angry that I put it away instead of keeping it in my hand.it was obvious she was in a bad mood and was looking for an excuse to flex. Only on Lynx do you get randomly checked for a ticket while on the plane. It felt more spacious than other flights I had been on.

### "the booths were all closed"
Straight up pathetic. Flight was delayed Hours before I even got to the airport. Then when I arrived at the “new time” (over 3 hours later then scheduled) I could not get a boarding pass as the booths were all closed. The customer service phone number was closed, and the online check in was blanked out. I’m going to miss the wedding I was going to attend, wasted my day getting to the airport, and $60 in Uber trips. What a joke of a company.

### "flight was delayed 5 times"
Not Verified |  Horrible airline, flown them 3 times. First time my flight was cancelled and the nearest alternative flight was in 5 days. The next time my flight was delayed 5 times each delay 30 min - 1 hr. And the last time it was delayed twice but could be more as I am waiting right now and they never even notified the passengers of the delay. Terrible airline deserves to be shut down. Plane was also dirty with garbage in the seats 2/3 times I flew.

### "definitely travel Lynx Air again"
I flew Calgary/Halifax return with a touchdown in Hamilton. The crew was great. I thought the seats were comfortable with lots of legroom. I was prepared for the lack of food/drink and entertainment by bringing by own on board. I will definitely travel Lynx Air again. My only negative would be that it would have been nice to be offered water more often.

### "definitely fly Lynx air again"
Our routes are Toronto-Edmonton and Calgary - Toronto. There was no issue with both flights. Our original returned flight was cancelled months before via email and they gave us 2 different time alternatives, we changed it accordingly. The flight itself is OK, with the price we are paying ($500 CAD for 2 people with 1 checked-in luggage for both route), we do not have any complaint. The chair is not adjustable, but it is a budget airline, so understandable. They offered us a glass of water on our returned flight. There was slight delay in our returned flight, but nothing crazy (20-30 mins delay). We also have no issue with our checked in luggage. We get our luggage in less than 30 minutes after we deplaned (the airport was not busy that time, so maybe that's why) Overall, will definitely fly Lynx air again if they have a promotion.

### "return flight home was just as pleasant"
My return flight home was just as pleasant as my flight heading out on vacation. Plane took off on time. Flight attendants were pleasant. You know there are no snacks so you bring your own. They offer water only. Make sure your phone is charged as they tell you upfront there are no charging ports & no wifi on board. Great savings on the cost of my flight! I will definitely fly with Lynx again! Thank you

### "definitely fly with Lynx Air again"
First time flying with Lynx Air. Had a 50% seat sale which was the deciding factor to fly Calgary to Winnipeg return. I would definitely fly with Lynx Air again! Comfortable seats, pleasant staff. The check-in staff at the check-in counters bent over backwards to accommodate. Returning flight, I had some food items in carry-on. Upon discussing if this should go into my carry-on staff member stated it would be required to place in my checked luggage. He allowed me to take my checked bag behind the counter so that the contents of my luggage was not on display to all passengers. Really appreciated. Loaves of bread and glass container of oils intact upon inspection post flight. Return flight left exactly at scheduled departure time. Flight to Winnipeg was an hour late and staff made passengers aware as to the reasons. I'm happy I tried out this new airlines. Yes it is bare essentials flight (no in flight snacks, served just water, seats do not decline and no entertainment) I would fly again. Savings of 50% was great!! And received a 35% discount card to be used for next flight.

### "I will use them again"
My wife and I recently flew to Halifax and back after a week. I was worried about the chaos coming from Air Canada so I chose a them. The price was extremely reasonable. Walked right up to the counter to a smiling face in Pearson and watched the frustrated travellers at the Air Canada huge line. The plane left not time with no hiccups. It is a no frills airline so expect that. The seats are a little cramped but it was durable for a short 2hr flight. I don't think I"d take a long flight with them. The staff were polite and courteous. There was a weather delay on the way back that was obviously out of their control but they kept us updated frequently. I will use them again like I said if I have a short flight/similar flight.

### "They cancelled my return ticket"
They cancelled my return ticket without notification and blamed it all on a system glitch. The customer service person hung up on me when I tried to talk to him! Is this how you treat your passenger? Cancel someone’s ticket and sell it to another passenger?

### "refund on the checked bag fee"
NO refund issued! When I made the reservation 4 months ago, I paid $81 for a checked bag. Recently, we were concerned with the nightmare stories we've been hearing about Toronto airport and lost baggage, so my wife and I managed to travel just with carry-on bags. I called the airline for a refund on the checked bag fee, and after sitting on hold for 1/2 hour, the service rep told me that fees like that 'are non-refundable'. Not happy!

### "only 50% was refunded"
Worst airline, decide wisely! My husband tried to save few penny and bought tickets from Lynx Air and about a week before our departure the flight got rescheduled by the airline and second time rescheduling happened just 2 days before our departure. The whole timing and everything was changed, it was frustrating. When we tried to cancel our flight I was given 2 options, to get a travel coupon or a full refund, I claimed for full refund and only 50% was refunded. We tried to contact Lynx Air so many times but all our calls went unanswered and never received a word back.

### "I was very happy with my flight"
Flight left on time. These are brand new airplanes. Flight attendants were fabulous. They even helped a couple families travelling with babies by cuddling & bouncing them while walking up & down the isle. You know ahead of time there are no snacks so you bring something with you. Price was very good compared to other airlines that I checked at time of booking. I paid for a carry on only so can’t comment on checked luggage experience. I was very concerned after reading a lot of bad reviews, however, I was very happy with my flight. I will fly with them again. My return flight is Aug 22nd hoping for another great experience Thank you!

### "rather curt with the customers"
This was my first flight with Lynx, and in some ways it exceeded my expectations; the online check-in and check-in at the airport were smooth, and the seat was as comfortable as I’ve come to expect on domestic flights from the other airlines. However, the following areas were not so pleasant:  They changed the departure time, making in 90 minutes earlier than original, and did not notify me by email or text. I only found this when I was checking in for the flight. Fortunately, we were able to modify our plans to travel to the airport with family, but if I had already booked an airport shuttle, this could have been a problem. They should let you know much earlier than that by the usual means when they change the departure time. They also changed the departure gate at the last minute at Toronto airport. In the final analysis, the flight came in late, and we departed over an hour later than the newly scheduled time anyway. One of the ground staff at the gate was very curt in how she dealt with the people lining up to get on the flight. We all know the drill - handicapped and elderly and those with children go first. However, my wife is 70 years old, had recently suffered a head injury and concussion, and was somewhat wobbly on her feet. She didn’t ‘look’ infirm; I.e. she didn’t have a cane or wheelchair, but as I was trying to explain her condition to this staff person and ask if we could board early, she wouldn’t even hear me out, but was barking orders at us and others to get out of the way for those with children. I protested, but moved out of the way. Later, she again barked at us to come and she allowed us to board early. We appreciated it, but her manner in both cases was not suitable for someone dealing with the passengers. The other gate staff, a couple of young women, were very pleasant to speak with. The flight attendant (male) was rather curt with the customers as we were boarding. He kept calling out “All backpack and personal items WILL be put under the seat in front of you.” He repeated this frequently as people boarded, never varying the wording. Felt like he was barking orders to the crowd. My wife and I were both in aisle seats, and the space under the seat in front of us was narrower than the width of a seat. Thus, our backpacks wouldn’t fit in them. He made my wife jam her backpack into the space anyway. Fortunately, the centre seat beside me was empty, and I could put mine there, because there was no way it was going to fit under the seat in front of me without being damaged. Meanwhile, there were empty spaces in the luggage bins right above our heads. I would suggest: The flight staff should phrase such directives as a request, like, “Please place your backpacks under the seat in front of you.”. That way it comes across as a request, not a barked order. A little common sense: If the space underneath is too narrow, place the item in the obviously empty spaces above rather than jamming it under and risking damaging the bag and its contents. This cast a negative pall over what was otherwise a positive experience.

### "literally stranded a mother and child"
Me and my sister in law, partner and 5 year old nephew flew from Toronto to St John’s Newfoundland no problem. On our return we were refused boarding because my sister in law had her expired license with her new paper drivers license as she waited for her new one in the mail. Due to covid you have to renew your drivers license online so she printed her copy and receipt. She was refused boarding in st. John’s as they wouldn’t accept it as ID. She even had the same information for her healthcard plus bank cards to verify her identity and the lady refused her. Then after an hour of me a white women yelling at her my black partner said one thing to her and she asked for security. After over an hour and a half she refused my sister in law but told me I could take her child if I wanted. We don’t share a last name, she never gave me permission to take her child. For all she knows I could me a new friend who just bought all our tickets together. After all that the airline wouldn’t cover anything and security tried to stick her and her son in a shelter. Turns out the shelter doesn’t take people out of province and she doesn’t have a credit card for a hotel. They literally stranded a mother and child after letting us fly with them to this province but refusing to let them come home. The cheap flight does not justify the indignity that happen out of uneducation staff

### "no communication, no email, nothing"
Not Verified |  We had a Calgary-Hamilton flight. Luckily we checked the night before as it was cancelled - no communication, no email, nothing. So we had to scramble and make alternate arrangements. And the best part is they re-booked the flight for 9 days later! We cancelled our return flight and got our money back (fool me once) after 2 calls (2 hour wait each time, first person didn’t process the refund, shocker!). Luckily as that flight got cancelled also.

### "I had a very good experience"
I had a very good experience with Lynx Air. I don't know why most of the reviews are so negative and for me the airlines deserve positive review as i have a very positive experience. The staff at Toronto Pearson airport was so polite kind and accommodating. I did the check in for less than 15 mins. It was fast and prior to my flight they email me about rescheduling the flight. Just needed to check the email regularly and u wont have a problem.

### "Nine days later, with no luggage"
Our family and friends booked a round trip from Calgary to Saint John New Foundland in July 2022. Three days prior to the return flight to Calgary, we received email informing that our scheduled fight was cancelled. Our next available flight is three days later: no explanation, no apology, no compensation. We took the flight three days later and arrived Calgary and were told our baggage are still somewhere in Toronto? We followed all procedures (filling missing baggage form), and were verbally informed by Lynx Air representative that we will have our luggage delivered at the address we provided within 72 hours. Nine days later, with no luggage, email or phone call from Lynx Air representative, we called the customer service. Believe it or not, none of the customer service representative has any record of the issue. They can only promise that they will "look into it", and they provide no timeline for feed back. I for sure will never use this airline again.

### "refuses to reimburse under CTA guidelines"
Not Verified |  My husband was supposed to fly from Calgary to Halifax in July (2022). When he arrived at the airport, there were no staff, no plane, and no warning. No one showed up. None of his fellow passengers received any type of communication from the airline until literally minutes before the plane should’ve departed. They then received an email saying the flights were changed - some to the next day and some to four days later. Everyone tried calling their customer support, but not a single person got through. The same thing happened the night before on the Toronto to Calgary leg. The cause for a no-show plane and flight crew? Lynx purchased an airplane that never showed up. A third-party rep who assists both Lynx and Flair with handling customer check-ins informed the group at the Calgary airport that they knew the night before that the flight had been cancelled. It was never cancelled online and passengers were never informed. In fact, the airline continued to sell tickets online that night, even though they knew the plane would never show up. Lynx also refuses to reimburse under CTA guidelines. Don’t waste your money. Spend a bit extra and fly with WestJet or anyone else.

### "bad customer care services"
Not Verified |  I booked a flight from YYZ to YYC, flight got delayed and I was at the airport 3hrs before. The line up at Pearson airport for lynx air was ridiculously long with one staff working at the check in counter. The staff was asked to close the check in counter leaving myself & three other people unable to check in. I was able to book another flight with air canada back to YYC that morning. Been on the phone with lynx air for a compensation fee but nothing, no help at all. Basically I’m unable to get my money back or any compensation. Lynx Air are very incompetent, bad customer care services, and all they care about is how to extort your money.

### "so awful it is almost funny"
Victoria to Calgary. We booked Lynx Victoria to Calgary return. Once baggage and seats were paid for there was not a significant cost savings compared to Westjet. Chose Lynx to give them a try and if it went well we would fly them again. Big mistake. We will never choose Lynx again. Our initial flight was changed soon after booking but it worked in our favour as the flight was leaving earlier allowing us to arrive in Calgary much earlier than the initial booking. Revised flight departure was 7:20 pm. At airline's suggestion we arrived 2 hours before departure. We checked flight status on the Lynx website before leaving home and enroute. Site was indicating flight was ON TIME. When we checked in the agent told us departure was now 10:15 pm. Website still showed 7:20 departure. Given we arrived early at airport, we now had 5 hours until departure. We left the airport and returned in plenty of time to get though security. At 10:15 pm there was not a Lynx plane in sight. We asked the gate attendant if there was actually a jet arriving for us. We were told there was and it was on the way. Website still showing 7:20 departure ON TIME. At approx. 10:45 pm a Summit Airlines jet arrives at the gate. No Lynx jet in sight. We are told that this Summit jet will take us to Calgary. We've never heard of this airline and were concerned for safety as the jet was nothing what we had expected. We got up in the air at approx 11:22 pm, 4 hours after scheduled departure. Lynx website still indicating 7:20 pm departure on time. Uneventful flight to Calgary, thankfully, albeit 4 hours late. Upon arrival in Calgary, Lynx website still showing 7:20 pm departure still ON TIME! Two weeks prior, same flight had been cancelled outright. We happened to be in the airport that evening for another flight and noted that Lynx air to Calgary flight cancelled. The return flight to Victoria was ON TIME- but not with Lynx air- it was another airline yet again. This time Northern Air and it was a familiar aircraft. We've had two flights with Lynx Air and have yet to see a Lynx aircraft- not sure if they exist. Must wonder how airline industry regulators allow a company like this to operate. We have requested the partial refund we are entitled to- still waiting. Lynx did not offer this- found the application on their website. Will never consider Lynx again and have told many friends about our experience. They too will not consider Lynx. Our experience was so awful it is almost funny.

### "Incredible experience"
Incredible experience. Positive! 10/10 For a start up I couldn’t be happier! They are very clear and efficient! Figured I’d review a positive note and remind positive experiences to support these guys with your positive reviews.

### "don’t take this airline"
Terrible airline. My friend and I chose this airline because it was cheap, and we thought “It can’t be that bad.” How wrong we were. On the flight back from Vancouver to Calgary our flight was delayed to 8pm (original 7:30ish). No big deal. While we were on the way to the airport it gets delayed to around 9pm. Again, not really a huge deal, as we were hoping to get back home at around 11ish. BUT when we got to the airport and decided to get dinner (it was around 7), that’s when we got the email saying our flight got delayed to 10:55, meaning we’d be back by 2am. We were both frustrated at this point since our flight was delayed 3 TIMES and it was starting to become ridiculous. We waited around the airport until around 9:50pm where it gets delayed to 11:05. Only a 10 minute difference but we were losing it. When we actually got onto the plane we didn’t even take off until around 11:30 This was extremely frustrating for us because we were hoping to get back home by transit (because we thought we’d be back earlier) but we were basically stranded at the airport, at like 3am because the bus and trains were off at the time. We had to call a bunch of people waking them up to ask if they could give us a ride and the uber/taxi was WAY too expensive. This airline may be cheap, but the amount of times it was delayed was incredibly ridiculous. Unless you are fine with lots of delays and maybe a cancellation last minute, don’t take this airline.

### "really terrible service"
My parents and I were flying out of Kelowna to Calgary. Our plane was delayed from the start and they ended up switching our aircraft to a smaller plane. Both my parents paid extra to preboard because they are in wheelchairs. They require a ramp to get in and out of the plane. The ramp was not available when we boarded which caused delays and they couldn't board till it was available. The aircraft then had to wait to fuel then it had electrical issues so we had to wait for that to be checked. The passengers eventually had to get off the plane. My parents and i couldn't get off the plane till the ramp arrived again. After a half hour of being left in the hot airplane, (it was 38° outside) without an exit, we were told that the ramp guy was sent home. My mother's legs were swollen and purple from the heat and my dad was experiencing dizziness and was weak. We were stuck in that hot airplane for 2 hours without air-conditioning or a way off. The emergency crew had to be called to get us off. We waited another four hours for another plane to come only to have it cancelled. There was nobody that could tell us what was going on. Not even the airport could reach the lynx company to find out any updates. Cheap flights yes but really terrible service. I hope Lynx will see this and start making some big changes to the way they treat their customers

### "Absolutely horrible"
Absolutely horrible. We show up to the airport for a July 30 - August 3rd vacation only to find out that Lynx Air has cancelled our flight. They offered us a different flight on August 6th! 3 days after our return flight. They blame the cancellation on lack of crew. They then change the reason to scheduled maintenance I assume to try and get out of the obligation to provide financial compensation as well as a refund. I called them right away and was on hold for over three hours trying to talk to them. So now they have failed the third obligation of providing a standard level of care. All in all I spent all day on hold, did not get to my destination and had to cancel my entire trip. Thanks Lynx!

### "customer support is almost entirely non existent"
Not Verified |  Unprofessional, worst flight experience of all time. Our plane was switched to Summit Air in the final hour and we waited on the tarmac for more than an hour in the blistering heat with no ac. They then discovered a mechanical issue and we were forced to deplane. Exited on the tarmac and had to go through tsa security for the second time. Updates on the flight were not sent in a timely fashion and the plane was ultimately canceled later that night. The only thing we received for compensation was a $10 snack voucher, I wish I was kidding. I would speak to the customer support but it’s almost entirely non existent. Pay the extra money and fly with confidence instead of these fraudsters who cut costs. Lynx is a garbage name too, the only thing they got right was the capital L cause that’s all you’ll be taking.

### "This whole experience was awful"
Not Verified |  The attendant indicated that there was a delay due to having a missing flight attendant and 30 passengers would have to be taken off the flight. At first they offered $100, a food coupon and hotel. Meanwhile while boarding they continued to instruct for people to back up and make a singular line and that they were only boarding family’s and priority. Other passengers crowed around. Later on they offer $250 with the same compensations. The right in their contract states 2400 with all other compensations provided but waited till then end to offer. They boarded the plane with all the rest of the passengers, and then sat everyone, waited half an hour and then called the passengers who would need to be removed off the plane. The customer service, the process and the communication of this airline is a mess. This whole experience was awful, it caused so much anxiety. Many of the attendants were telling people different things. When we noted that we listen to them and waited in the back to be called, they responded with who said that rule of uncrowding and singular lines. Not worth the money, I would rather any other flight company.

### "On time and very affordable"
Not Verified |  Great flight! On time as promised and very affordable. I’m so happy to see another airline between these provinces. WestJet and Air Canada are just too expensive. Cons: - no chargers on seats, no reclining seats and no food

### "Very frustrating experience"
My flight got cancelled few hours before departure. They provided an alternative flight which was a week later. Me and my husband cant afford to wait so many days in a city for that many days. Out of helplessness, we had to get last minute tickets back home to Edmonton. We have been contacting them for getting some compensation but neither they are replying to emails nor responding through call center. Very frustrating experience. Please never travel Lynx air.

### "do not use this airline"
I have read this relatively new company is experiencing very painful teething pains but regularly failing customers won't help their business model and customer experience. We were a team of International Hockey Players with partners. The flight was delayed by over 3.5 hours- no pre or updated communications; ground staff appeared untrained and lacking knowledge; our request for food vouchers, which were finally issued, was only to find out that none of the stores would accept them and then when we finally got onto a plane they announced "with service" but there was none. Arrived at our final destination at 4.30 am - not good as expected to be there around 11.30 pm. I have sent a note to the CEO and others in her team but could not find a correct corresponding email address. Also logged a complaint on their website and still await a reply. Strongly recommend if you have other options do not use this airline. We had another internal flight later that week - Calgary to Kelowna - only a 45 min delay so we shall forgive them that one.

### "both family members did not have any issues with their flights"
My son travelled between Toronto Pearson and Vancouver International airports in June and my wife travelled the same route in May 2022. Both travelled at a time when Pearson began experiencing delays and lost luggage issues, but fortunately, both family members did not have any issues with their flights or baggage. Each family member was taking advantage of Lynx Air's affordable airfares within Canada for separate vacations this year. My wife's flight from YYZ to YVR in May had only 15 passengers aboard and neither my son or wife had any complaints with the level of service, meal service or crew members. If Lynx Air is able to sustain this level of satisfaction enjoyed by my family, we'll have another competitor in the country to travel with.

### "request for compensation was declined"
My flight was cancelled, after it's scheduled departure time, and my request for compensation, to cover the costs I incurred as a result, was declined. This would be excusable by a new frontline customer service representative, but the request was also declined by a number of mid and senior level managers, and eventually the CEO. Lynx Air's customer service team, as well as mid and senior level management, were not only difficult to reach, but responses were generic and lacked compassion. It felt as if I was talking to an automated system and it was a truly horrific experience. In an email exchange with CEO, the out-of-pocket expenses I incurred and poor customer service were acknowledged, yet my request for reimbursement was declined, and reference was made to 'legal requirements'. I would recommend travellers avoid this airline, despite the allure of low cost travel.

### "Worst customer service"
Not Verified |  Worst customer service I have ever experienced over lost luggage. No connecting flights just a straight show from Vancouver to Calgary. 2 months it's been missing they said they were shipping it to me and still nothing. Now when I call I am placed on hold and usually about a half hour in or so my call gets picked up then dropped 1 second later. Now I have to stay on hold for over 2 hours and no one ever picks it up. I do not recommend Lynx Air for travel.

### "I'd use them again"
Not Verified |  Last week I flew with them from Edmonton to Newfoundland with my boys. No issues. 6 hours something in the air. Didn't need to deplane in Toronto. Edmonton airport was nuts, so we were 40 minutes late leaving. No food on board, but offered water. No charging ports or screens. Its a bare bones airplane but I'd use them again. The founder and CEO was speaking in Edmonton before our flight since it was the first one out of Edmonton. She said she was tired of paying premium prices for flights just because an airline offered food, when half the time they didn't have what she asked for and she still had to pay. That now there's no need for in flight entertainment because everyone has devices, so no need to charge extra for tickets because of that. We paid $2060.00 for 3 of us including 2 suitcases and seat selection. When both the other airlines was $4500.00 for the same, and much longer travel days and multiple connections. No complaints. Flying with kids its worth it for me to have the shorter travel time. Sucks they're out of Edmonton but even with the drive and hotel it was way cheaper. Hoping for the same experience on the way home.

### "flight was canceled for 2 times"
Calgary to Toronto. My flight was canceled for 2 times, I'm stuck in Calgary from Sunday to Friday around 5 days. The staff are so careless.

### "Return trip was a nightmare"
Booked our first Lynx Air trip to Hamilton for a family weekend at Niagara Falls. On the trip down we had no issues. Return trip was a nightmare. Return flight was cancelled a few weeks before we left and they automatically book you a different flight. We were moved from a flight leaving Toronto Pearson at 16:55 EST to 6:55 EST. So if we had to be there 2 hours before plus the hour drive in we would have had to leave our location at 3:55 am (with no other issues). We have a 5 and 7 year old as well and if we took into consideration the 2 hour time change between Toronto and Calgary we would not have slept. It was impossible for us to manage so I tried to reach support at Lynx .. one, two, three times and on my third attempt over a few days I was on the phone over an hour before hanging up. I could have cancelled the return flight for the full amount but there is a lack of clarity because the site also notes that if you cancel your flight you may be subject to penalties so I was worried about cancelling our flight from Calgary to Hamilton without speaking to a customer representative. However, I was able to change the assigned flight time to a later flight leaving Hamilton to Calgary. It was two hours later than our initial flight and at the time I made the change it was less expensive on the Lynx website but they didn't reimburse us the difference despite the complications they created. Day of the return flight home we arrive on time and realize the flight is delayed out of Hamilton by an hour. That turned into 5 hours with no explanations. We arrived at our home 4:55 am MST (6:55 EST) for a flight that was canceled, that we then had to change from the assigned time, then at least 4 delays which meant we took a red eye for a flight we initially paid to leave at 4:55 pm. All this at the same cost and not one moment of assistance from Lynx Air. In summary, I cant comment on the service because there wasn't any! You're on your own when you book with Lynx so cross your fingers that you don't have problems. Lynx essentially charged us for a more expensive flight, cancelled it and we had to pay the same amount for what ended up being a red eye with two kids in tow and no explanation or attempt to assist with communication about cancellations or customer complaints. You get what you pay for here! !

### "Disappointed by Lynx"
Disappointed by Lynx. Canceled my flight without any notice. Told me it was sent by email but nothing. We rebooked our flight and charged us with 99 dollars per passenger. Never ride with them again.

### "do not care about their customers"
I have yet to fly with lynx. However this review is to reflect their customer service, because they have none. I contracted Covid and tested positive last night (July 20) but have a flight booked for me and my partner for July 23rd. I contacted customer service as soon as I could this morning (they only operate 7am-7pm) to notify them and change our flight booking by 1 week. They proceeded to tell me they could provide a voucher for my flight but my partners flight could not be cancelled or covered, it would have to be forfeited or he would have to take the flight with out me. We are going on vacation together. The flight booking has both of us on the same reservation. The first person I spoke to was rude and hung up on me after I waited 45 minutes to speak with someone. I called back, 1.5 hours on hold and asked to speak to a supervisor. Another 30 minutes and the line is disconnected again on their end. Don’t waste your time and money. They do not care about their customers.

### "Never again will I book with Lynx"
Never received an email that flight was changed or cancelled! I am flying with my 2 young children and an infant by myself and now stranded in Calgary. Read many poor reviews, but decided to give the flight a try anyway. Never again will I book with Lynx!

### "They have the worst customer service"
Not Verified |  Flew with Lynx on June 19 and returned home on June 25, but without my luggage. To date, July 20, I have not received any response to my emails or social media requests about said lost luggage. They have the worst customer service. I get there are tons of delays right now and I can understand waiting a bit to hear back but a month with no contact is crazy. Do not fly this scam of an airline.

### "hoped that I might be able to get a refund"
I did not actually fly with Lynx. I had to cancel my flight because my child is in the hospital. When I cancelled there was a $72.44 fee for the cancellation and then the remainder of my flight ($272.95) was given to me as a "voucher" not as a refund. The voucher can only be used by myself and expires in 12 months. All of this is clearly outlined in their policies. However, given the circumstances, I have very little chance of flying over the next year, I had hoped that I might be able to get a refund. I spent an 1.5 hours on hold. The agent I spoke to then said there was absolutely nothing they could do for me and just kept referring to the online policy. There was no one else they were willing to transfer me to and no one else who could help me.

### "Do not waste your time and money"
Not Verified |  Do not waste your time and money booking with Lynx Air, unless you are ok with them changing your schedule right up to the last minute. I booked a flight two weeks in advance to attend my father's 80th birthday and return on the very next flight back. Two days after booking, Lynx sent an email that the flight departure time was delayed by a few hours. Not great, but I can work with this. Then late last night, less than 48 hours to departure, I get an email that the flight has been cancelled (due to conditions beyond their control). Now I am scrambling to make alternate arrangements. Contacting Lynx Air 'customer service' is a no-go. On hold for hours and no answer, plus the comment every few minutes while on hold that Lynx will charge for customer service phone calls - customer service is non-existent. Should have spent the extra $150 up front for service from a reliable airline. Strongly advise against booking with this airline if you value your time. If I could give a negative star rating I would.

### "I will never fly Lynx again"
I booked with Lynx when they first opened in April 2022 for a trip to Calgary with my daughter (her first trip). Our first flight was for 7pm ... we didn't take off till 11:40pm and they didn't even consistently update me, you just had to wait. A 4.5 hour wait, late into the night, with a 6 year old is awful. Once we got to Calgary it took 45min just for the baggage to start coming in. We didn't get to our hotel till 2:30am and missed our car rental (ended up paying an extra $700 for a car rental) and nearly our hotel room. I emailed Lynx with no response. The plane was in reasonable condition but absolutely no extras, including snacks or in flight services. Staff were pleasant. On our trip home a week later I received no communication able our flight, I just happened to check it and it was canceled and changed to 2.5 days later with no other option. I had to wait on hold to speak to someone for 2 hours and 18minutes! Only option was a flight 2.5 days later or refund and pay $1200 for new tickets with a different airline. I will never fly Lynx again.

### "we are told flight is cancelled"
Not Verified |  Unbelievable service. Had a booking from Kelowna to Calgary then from Calgary to Winnipeg. Checked in for both flights. Get to the airport we are told flight is cancelled. Twice. Ended up paying $1200 for two with Westjet to fly to Calgary. Then same thing in Calgary. Another $1300 with Westjet to Winnipeg. Sitting at the airport waiting for the 2.30 flight. Will never book with Lynx again. I don’t expect them to stay in business too long.

### "if you keep this nonsense up, no one will want to fly with you"
Worst service I have ever encountered. I've flown many airlines, through many routes, with different types of service, etc. But this one takes the cake for probably the worst airline I have ever flown. Let's start from the beginning, shall we? I was originally booked for the Toronto to Edmonton flight that was set to depart around 11.30pm local time on July 17, 2022. But lo and behold the flight is cancelled. The email was sent the day before the flight saying the flight is not "available" whatever that means. Call customer service, sit there for 40 mins, eventually get someone to answer my call, turns out I can't rebook with another route other than the original one. So, I was pretty much stuck and had to book on my own terms. Funny thing is, the airport websites, every other website, says the flight is still scheduled, so whoever is doing the updating, needs to be fired or retrained because the amount of confusion and stress that it caused all of us is unreal. I asked them to book me another route, but I'm told they cannot. Thank you, Lynx, for the amazing service. Really. The icing on the cake. I rebook through Lynx from Hamilton to Calgary on Y9 508. set to depart at 10.05pm local time, the flight is delayed, five times. The flight only left Hamilton for Halifax at 8.30pm, and we're set to leave in an hour and a half. When the flight finally arrives, it's almost 2am. We board, and we're stuck on the airplane even longer, and we're delayed even more until it's almost 4am when we finally take-off. Everyone looked so exhausted, they couldn't be angry even if they wanted to. So, on behalf of everyone on Y9 508 on July 17, 2022, complain as much a possible about this airline and get as much compensation as you possibly can, because this is completely unacceptable. Dear Lynx, you should be ashamed to call yourselves a "leading" low cost airline. If you want pointers, look to JetBlue, Southwest, and Swoop, if you can't understand the meaning of quality service, don't be in this industry! Your passengers are your bread and butter, if you keep this nonsense up, no one will want to fly with you and you'll be on the same shelf as Zellers and Target.

### "disappointed and disgusted with this service"
Not Verified |  I sure wish I had read these reviews before booking a flight with Lynx Air. Vancouver to Calgary return. $150. Great price. I was staying overnight so booked a hotel. Firstly my departing flight time was changed which was annoying but acceptable. I never received any more emails from them so assumed all was well. Until I tried to check in online yesterday. Took a long time to get to the check in screen and when I finally did I saw that my flight for today had been changed to tomorrow with the return flight the same day a few hours later. No use for the business I needed to do in Calgary. As it had taken so long to check in online and learn about the change I was too late to cancel my hotel booking so now I have to pay for an unused hotel room as well as the flight. If I ‘cancel’ the flight it warned of a charge to do this so I am reluctant to incur any more charges. I tried to change the flight dates but wasn’t able to do that either. I haven’t tried calling them. Didn’t know how to find a phone number. I am so disappointed and disgusted with this service and agree with the other reviewers who say don’t use this airline. We do need competition however and I was optimistic Lynx Air would be a good addition to our flight options. Not the case.

### "no one picks up the phone"
Not Verified | Vancouver to Toronto. Utter trash. My flight at 2:10pm was delayed to 3:00 at 7am the same day, and then at 11am they cancelled it completely. Counter staff is completely useless and when you call them on customer services, no one picks up the phone even after 2 hours.

### "not have our luggage for our seven day trip"
Not Verified |  Worst experience. Emailed Lynx about cancelling one ticket, they did not respond until 10 days had passed. We arrived in Winnipeg and our luggage did not make it, and we were told to call or email. We did not have our luggage for our seven day trip, and after continuous emailing and waiting on calls for hours without them picking up, we still have not heard anything back. This company is the biggest joke ever.

### "I will never fly this airline again"
Not Verified |  I was going on a weekend trip to Halifax to see a friend. I arrived at the airport 3 hrs before due to airport delays. When I arrived the the airport I found out that my flight way delayed from 1:50pm to 4:45pm. At 4:45 pm the next flight scheduled posted on the board at the gate was our flight y9505. There was no employees at the gate at that time nor was there a plane at the gate. At 5:30 pm an air Canada employee arrived at the gate and told us that an air Canada flight was arriving. At this point we had still received no notification that the flight was canceled. It wasn't until another passenger got ahold of customer service did we find out our flight was canceled. We received no email, no board updates, no intercom announcement. This is unacceptable. Lucky I was from the area and could go home. There was family's on day 2 of being in the airport. I will never fly this airline again! I am still waiting for a refund!

### "flight got delayed twice and then canceled"
Not Verified |  The same flight got delayed twice and then canceled 10 minutes before we were supposed to board. They didn’t offer any sort of compensation. The airline said they would send out an email to compensate for flight and hotels. Never did. Customer service do not get back to you. They said they could book me on a flight 2 days later! Absolutely absurd.

### "I would not recommend this airline"
I would not recommend this airline. First off they only have four planes in there fleet, so if something goes wrong you’re screwed. We boarded the plane in Toronto only to sit on the tarmac for 3 hours (some kind of issue with the plane). Once they realized there was nothing they could do we were told to evacuate the plane and would be greeted by representatives to rebook/ get a refund. There are no representatives for this airline so we all had to call the support phone number and sit on hold for 8 hours. There were 300 angry customers all trying to get to Calgary. I ended up canceling my flight and flying with a different airline the next day. Also had to fight for a full refund on my credit card because they wanted to give me bank the money towards another flight. I said “hell no I would never fly with this airline again”. No one knows what they’re doing and management is horrific! The price definitely seems tempting but you’ll get screwed I promise you that.

### "Seats comfortable and nice staff"
No issues with this airline. Best thing is it was basically on time. Seats comfortable and nice staff. Kudos for keeping the prices low. Will fly again with this airline without hesitation.

### "flight has totally been cancelled"
My flight was originally booked for a 10.30 flight out of Calgary to Vancouver, Saturday 16th that got put back to an early afternoon flight .. about 2 hour delay.. this was Wednesday 13th so not to bad! Today i got an email from them about how flights because of COVID and lack of staff and staffing levels etc that they are experiencing service issues? Still take your money though NOW just three hours after that email I get an email my flight has totally been cancelled and the earliest flight they can get me on is Monday 18th July, 2 days later than what I booked! Ring them up wait hours on the phone speak to someone based and they explained they could cancel my flight entirety and reimburse me my money back and could also put me on another flight for $400! Not only do i have to book another two nights in a hotel, stampede week double the price but also I have lost a days pay.

### "Not worth the couple bucks you may save"
Not Verified |  Not worth the couple bucks you may save. Cancelled our flight from Calgary to Kelowna with less than 24 hours. We were checked in. They then proceeded to book us flying out of Calgary the day we were to return. The "change" options on their web site charge you a $200 change fee (even though it was their change) and email a "voucher" for future flights with Lynx. No thanks. Tried to get a hold of them on their "customer service" line and waited hours upon hours and at times their phone lines do not even work. Booked with Westjet. Never again.

### "Absolutely terrible"
Not Verified |  Absolutely terrible, they cancelled the flight on July 15th and then we got notified that our flight is going to be on the next day. The flight was supposed to be at 6.15 but the it got delayed until 10. Then, it got delayed till 12 and when everybody was waiting, they said it was cancelled.

### "They don’t care about customer service"
Horrible experience. Missed my flight due to the screen at Toronto Pearson sending me to the wrong gate the day of the Rogers outage. Spent over 7 hours on the phone getting different stories from different people and finally being told they wouldn’t refund me, not even for my seat selection or carry on bag fees. Do not waste your time with this airline. They don’t care about customer service at all.

### "I'd get my refund within 3-5 days"
Not Verified |  I was looking for a cheap flight out of Vancouver and found this airline as our cheapest option. I've never heard of Lynx before, so I was a bit skeptic of it. I found a great flight time (12pm) and was so excited I didn't have to wake up early and wouldn't have to worry about traffic. About a week before our flight, I got an email saying "your flight has changed. I went to the Lynx website and looked into my booking. Your flight has been canceled. Instantly, I went to rebook for a different time, but it instantly set me to an 8pm flight. When I tried to change it to an earlier time, it kept saying that I was downgrading my ticket and I couldn't change it to that time. So, I was stuck with the 8pm flight. I went back to my cancelation email and noticed it said "if the selected times do not work for you, you can get a refund. I tried calling the customer service line, but in the automated message, it mentioned I'd get charged a fee for calling. I sent in 3 emails asking for a refund, but never heard anything. I ended up buying a new set of tickets for the earlier time (6am) so I was pretty bummed out that I just dropped double the price I intended to spend. When the day came that I was flying out, I checked in at the Lynx counter and mentioned what had happened. The guy gave me a piece of paper with an email address on it and said to contact this address. Within a few hours, I got an email back saying I'd get my refund within 3-5 days. And yes, I did get it on day 3 which was great. As for the flight itself, my husband is taller so he didn't have much of a headrest. I am shorter so it was comfortable for me.

### "never travel with Lynx Air again"
I will never travel with Lynx Air again, and I do not recommend it to anyone. They cancelled our 6:40 pm Calgary-Vancouver flight on July 7, 2022 and moved us to the 12:40 pm flight without informing us. We just knew by accident mid-night when we checked flight status. They did not care if we are able to make the 12:40 pm flight or not.

### "don’t even try this airline"
This first and last time we are travelling with Lynx Airline. We had long delay in round trip from Vancouver to Calgary, When we reached to Vancouver Airport, Lynx counter told us that flight has 2 hours delay and when we asked them why you did not update the system they did not answer anything. I will recommend everyone to don’t even try this airline does not even follow the basic services. They don’t care customers at all.

### "Stay clear from this airline"
Stay clear from this airline. We decided to give Lynx Air a try, but will not return! We arrived at our gate early, and when we arrived the plane was there so we were excited that it would be on time! As we approached our flight departure time though things changed drastically. Right at the time of departure was an announcement that one of their crew members was sick and unable to make the flight so they had to call another flight member. They had no ETA and it sounded like they were scrambling to find someone. As we waited the staff at the check in counter were very unprofessional swearing, chatting about bad coworkers and the like. They also were rude to customers who asked about refunds and such telling them they were 3rd party contractors and not with lynx air. There was last of customer service here. As we waited they then determined there would be a delay of 1 hour. By the time that hour came near they were talking of possible cancelation or increased delays, until thankfully another crew member came. They had no organization at the check in even though rows were called in order. Once we got on the flight there was another customer with the exact same seat number as another, even on the half full flight. My husband decided being a red eye to move to the seats in front of us to sleep, which happened to be emergency exit rows, and the flight attendant literally woke him up to tell him he couldn't sleep there as people paid extra for that seat (even though no one was there). The flight crew was also unprofessional in my opinion caring more about taking sunrise pictures than doing their job. I am not impressed and judging by at least 5 other customers who I heard from neither was anyone else! Stay clear!! Way back was ok, but still had a hour delay and they sent an email stating pm instead of am which would have been 12 hours delay, which lead to panic in the check in line. Customer service and staff was much friendlier on way back but still uncomfortable seats. Would recommend for a 2 hr flight but not more.

### "have more responsibility with customer"
I booked a ticket to go to Toronto June 24, I paid for that, they sent me 2 kind of email confirmation number but both of them is different date. I had to stay at the airport for 3 hours, they said my name is not on the list and their plane was full and they told me to call the hot line. I called them, and they didn’t have any responsibility, just blame on each other. I lost my money, missed my flight, wasted my time… I hope you can can give customer an respect and have more responsibility with customer.

### "Will fly them again"
Its a brand new airline. so much so, I looked for reviews before I bought the ticket and saw there were none. This might be the first. Lynx Air began service in May 2022 I think. It s Ultra Low Cost Domestic Airline based out of Calgary and serving major Canadian cities. I bought our one way ticket at a ridiculously low price and with no history or knowledge of this airline. All a part of the adventure. Ticket cost was very low, but, I also like amenities which I don't mind paying for. This is offered as an option. Aircraft are brand spanking new planes, complete with that new plane smell. We paid about CAD50.00 to book the first bulkhead row at row 2. Great leg room and comfortable seat. Just like any of the other new 737 Maxs I've flown on recently, with other airlines, in the same seat. Now, you are told in an email that there is no inflight service and encourage you to bring your own. The crew did pass around twice with the trolley offering water, but, this it. For the rest of the flight they all huddled in the galley chit-chatting. I really thought as a new airline, they would be more engaging with the new customers .... felt like they were more interested in their "reunion' after attending FA School. But its Ultra Low Cost and the place is comfy and we go to where we were going precisely on time and with great ease. Will fly them again.
