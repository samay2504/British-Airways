### "Do not use this airline"
Do not use this airline. Flight was canceled twice. We had to wait four extra days in Medan to fly. Once we got to the airport they said our luggage would not arrive till three days after we got there. Absolute worst experience I’ve ever had flying and I’m an avid international traveler. Only fly with wings if you want to waste a week of your holiday and not have your luggage with you the whole time. I had a friend fly with them a month earlier and the same thing happened to him. Seems to be a trend.

### "Avoid if you can!"
Two times using this airline, two times flights have been delayed. There’s no information or communication with the passengers whatsoever. First flight was delayed by 2 hours and then we were in the tarmac for over 30 minutes with no aircon in the muddles of the day. Very old plane with not functioning aircon. Second time plane has been delayed for one hour. Avoid if you can!

### "I will never fly again with them"
Our flight is initially scheduled to leave on 9:20am, that was delayed and changed to 12:30 pm, and it was dealyed again to 1:15pm. They packed all the passengers into the aircraft before it took off and the AC was not on.. i feel extremely suffocated and hot inside the plane with very poor ventilation inside. This is inhumane and also we have lost the whole day of our time in Lombok due to their flight delay. I will never fly again with them

### "flight departed and arrive on time"
The airline is convenient for the short trip between Bali and Lombok with few other carriers on this route. There are regular flight schedules. Due to passenger volume, a twin propellor plane is used, which are never as comfortable as a jet. Overall, I am happy the service exists however on this leg of the journey the plane had been sitting on the tarmac for a while and the air temp inside was extremely hot and even when in the air, the air con was substandard and the cabin temperature was still warm to hot. As is common with propellor aircraft, there is no aero-bridge which on this flight meant cross through 2 rows of planes to get to the bus. Both Air Wings flight departed and arrive on time which is good.

### "Charged double for baggage handling"
Not Verified |  Charged double for baggage handling, AUD$230. Flying from Bima Sumbawa to Denpasar Bali via Lombok. I didn't get off the plane, neither did my surfboards and bag but Lion/Wings Air charged me for baggage handling twice. Baggage was more than the flight itself. If you fly with someone else, do it.

### "Avoid this airline at all cost"
Not Verified |  This local airline is expensive compared to other local airlines. To our surprise when we checked in at the airport they told us that we needed to pay extra for luggage. Cost the 3 of us an extra $AU 125. Check in took almost 1 and a half hour. Cabin crew did not have a smile as though they did not want to be there. We flew Citilink that was much cheaper and included luggage. Avoid this airline at all cost when travelling in Indonesia.

### "very rude to all passengers"
Not Verified |  I was flying with my two little Kids. Although according to Boarding Pass Boarding should have started at 09:50, the Crew announced the final Call at 09:38. When we asked why the rush, they screamed at US If we want to fly we should get Info the Pläne right now. No Service at all by Ground Crew and very rude to all passengers.

### "don't want to admit their mistakes and help"
Not Verified |  This airline is very unprofessional they just don't want to admit their mistakes and help. They have changed my time of departure 3 weeks before my flight and did not let me know i have figured it out just day before my departure. Thanks to them I have missed my international flight paid 1500 euros more. Until now no one has admitted their mistake no one has apologised. And no one wants to help. Clearly they are ignoring my messages and also clearly they dont see my point of if i get confirmed tickets you have to let me know for any change. If they would let me know i could change my international flight before and I wouldn't end it up paying extra money!

### "They are extremely unprofessional, useless and rude"
Not Verified |  They have changed my time of departure 3 weeks before my flight without letting me know, I missed my international flight, spent extra 1500 euros because of that, also another flight had 12 hours delay, we lost our paid hotel because we weren't able to get to the hotel on time. They are extremely unprofessional, useless and rude. Don't want to pay me compensation even if its clearly their mistake for not letting me know for reschedule timing of mine confirmed ticket.

### "seats were reasonably comfortable"
Kaimana to Manokwari. Plane left 7 and arrived 5 minutes late - really on time in this part of the world. The check in staff were very flexible about cabin luggage size. On board, seats were reasonably comfortable and crew pleasant.

### "Overall a smooth flight"
Manokwari to Kaimana. Flight was 15 minutes late to depart. Check in staff very lenient about size of hand luggage. On board seats were fine, aircon good, cabin crew helpful. No food or drinks available even for purchase, but who needs them on a short flight anyway? Overall a smooth flight.

### "cannot be paid online with mastercard"
Lombok to Labuan Bajo. Checked baggage cannot be paid online with mastercard. If you are lucky to have time to buy extra baggage in Asia you safe some money. If not, buy a ticket from another airline, that's cheaper. Lion air never responded on emails or webforms. Before take off and landing the crew didn't check passengers seatbelts or seat upright. Nothing was served during a 1hr 15min flight, compared to NAM Air on a shorter flight, they gave even a small lunch. The plane also looked a bit old, both inside and out.

### "a smooth flight"
Wamena to Jayapura with Wings Air. Being the first flight of the day, the aircraft was on standby at the airport and departed pretty much on time. It was a smooth flight with no issues whatsoever.

### "Aircraft was clean, cool and comfortable"
Jayapura to Wamena with Wings Air. Plane left only half an hour late. Aircraft was clean, cool and comfortable, crew polite. The lack of any meals or drinks available was not an issue on this short flight.

### "our flight was cancelled"
We were supposed to fly from Galela the day before but our flight was cancelled. Local Wings staff helpfully offered to rebook us for next day from Kao or Ternate at no extra cost. The flight from Kao left only 15 minutes late, and was on a clean, well airconditioned aircraft with nice crew. Of course no meals or free checked in luggage.

### "flight delayed for 2 hours"
Not Verified |  I'd booked a flight from Surabaya to Bandung on August 8th 2019, but because of a sudden meeting schedule required me to reschedule my flight on August 06th 2019. I paid 663k Rupiahs for the rescheduling administration, but I got my flight delayed for 2 hours without any proper announcements just from the display on the airport. And the airline gave the passengers the compensation (rice, noodle, spicy beef) after I asked about it. If I don't have a meeting required me to attend early in the morning, I would have bought the tickets from another flight providers.

### "Horrible customer service"
Tambolaka to Denpasar. They are never on time. Which is normal when you don’t pay the price - however there is no information. Two hour delay and there is no representative to explain us the situation. So we are late, and not sure how long more we will be. Horrible customer service.

### "typical no-frills flight"
Jayapura to Yahukimo. Flight left only about half an hour late, good by Wings' standards! It was also half empty, so quite comfortable despite being a typical no-frills flight with no food or drink provided.

### "flight is delay for 3 hours"
Denpasar to Malang. I got message 1 day before that flight will be an hour earlier. Then I got to the airport in hurry and the flight is delay for 3 hours. Price for the ticket is more than usual and still bad service. If there is other direct flight for my destination i will never use this flight

### "wouldn't recommend"
Yogyakarta to Bandung. Always delayed, no inflight entertainment as promised (always said on process of installment even tho it's been years), bad service, staff is rude, inconvenient flight times. Had to queue for a long line just to print boarding pass (ridiculous). Too bad it’s the only airline available for some routes, that’s why Indonesian domestic flights have to use this trash airline. Wouldn't recommend, save your energy, time and sanity with other options.

### "Worst airline I’ve experienced"
Bima to Bali. This is also Lion Air. Worst airline I’ve ever experienced. Delayed 4 hours then told cancelled, nowhere to stay for the night. Then charged me more for my surfboards than the cost of my ticket. The day before they cancelled all 3 flights without telling anybody, leaving them all stranded for the night.

### "cheap and the plane is new"
Jakarta (HLP) to Bandung is a new route from Wings Air. This flight only take about 22 minutes. since Wings Air is a LCC, inflight food are only available by purchasing it. I dont know what are they selling, maybe some snacks and there wasnt any menu card or something like that. I like to fly with Wings Air since it is cheap and the plane is new but what I dont like is the stewardess are just little bit smile less.

### "no text message from Wings Air"
The flight from JOG to SUB (18.10) was cancelled because only a few passengers booked the seats and they were moved onto the flight before them (16.35). The staff said that they had passed on the information to each passenger's mobile phone, but I didn't receive it. Fortunately they rescheduled my flight to the first flight tomorrow morning (06.10). In the morning there was another problem, they said my ticket couldn't be checked in. I came at 05.00 and I had to wait for 30 minutes to get my boarding pass. I was surprised again that my boarding pass was manually written, so why did I need to wait for 30 minutes if at the end they just write it down? On my return flight, Wings Air surprised me again. I came to the check-in counter and found that my flight (16.25) was cancelled (again) and rescheduled to the next flight (19.30). For the reason they said they had sent me the information to my mobile phone. My mobile phone is on all the day and there was no text message from Wings Air.

### "stay away from Wings Air"
❎ Unverified |  Medan to Sibolga. Unfortunately i have no other choice than to fly Wings Air almost every month for work reasons, I have traveled on Wings at least 30 times and not once has the plane departed on time, delays from minimum 45 mins to my record stands at 9 hours with no communication or explanation from Wings Air. However after my latest 4 hour delay in Medan Airport on March 7th I received the best news, Garuda have pushed back their departure time from 08.50 to 10.00 meaning I can now connect with that flight from Singapore happy days, never again will I have to fly Wings Air. Warning to all stay away from Wings Air at all costs.

### "Dirty and worn out interior"
Ampana to Palu. Tobacco fumes from air con during whole flight though it was a no smoking flight. From the cockpit or the toilet? Dirty and worn out interior. Only 10 kg luggage and paid in advance for the extra 10 we had for free at Lion. again trouble at uncheck desk. The Wings staff at Ampana was incapable to handle a incheck, could not speak English and hardly handle a computer, even though 4-5 staff was behind one desk! Even we had the receipt of paid luggage, they used more than 15 minutes to make a boarding card. Also 2 hour delay, but we got one glass of water for free. No apology and no information inflight from cockpit. The flight attendant spoke fast and hardly understandable English.

### "a lack of communication"
I flew with Wings Air (part of Lion Air) as a part of a party of four surfers. We travelled from Bali to Sumbawa Besar via Lombok on Tuesday 19/7/16 and made the return trip on Friday 29/7/16. In summary of our experience do not fly Wings Air to get to your destination, particularly if you are a surfer. Cost for surfboards. The cost is Rp 200 000 per surfboard per flight. This means that flying from Bali to Sumbawa, which entailed two flights connecting in Lombok, cost Rp400 000 per board each way. We could not find this information anywhere on the Wings Air/Lion Air website, which of course would have informed our choice of airline. The Wings Air employee at check-in at Denpasar told us that the cost is indeed not on their website. Treatment of checked in surfboards - My brother paid Rp 1 200 000 for three surfboards from Sumbawa Besar via Lombok to Bali. His board case was left in Lombok and involved considerable time and hassle to get back in Bali. I paid Rp 800 000 for two surfboards from Sumbawa Besar via Lombok to Bali. One of my boards arrived with damage. Communication - We first attempted to travel from Bali to Sumbawa Besar on Monday 18/7/16. There were legitimate reasons for flights to be delayed that day – some repairs were being made to the runway. The level of frustration and angst at the gates being used by Wings Air was fuelled by a lack of communication and miscommunication. After several hours of seeking information, we were told that our 3pm flight would leave at 6.45pm. We sought confirmation of this on a further four occasions as we were keen to not miss our flight. When 6:45pm came we went to the gate to check what was happening to be told that our flight (and our surfboards) had already left at 5.10pm. A number of other passengers were also left stranded by this action. We went to the Wings Air/Lion Air office to work out how we could now get to Sumbawa Besar, and how we could ensure the security of our four surf bags with 11 surf boards. We were amazed to find that Wings Air tried to make us pay for new flights as we had “failed to turn up to the gate” for our flight (even though we were only sitting 10m away, having been assured again that our flight would not leave until 6.45pm).

### "avoid Lion Air and Wings Air"
Wings Air from Denpasar to Lombok. Flight IW1850 After waiting for 4.5 hours still no ground staff could tell if or when the flight would leave. Unacceptable! My family will never fly Wings Air again! Wings Air and its parent company (Lion Air) flights are almost always late, between 30 and 90 minutes! But today's delay of IW1850 is too much. Avoid Lion Air and Wings Air.
