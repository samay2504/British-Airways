### "Best to avoid this airline"
Not Verified |  We flew on flight 3U3885 April 5th and it was a very ordinary flight from check to landing . The ground staff at check in at Chengdu have no reasonable thoughts about luggage. We had an extra piece of luggage over the one piece rule . We are older make our luggage light to lift and carry we were in total ten kilos under the total weight rule . We were charged over $200 dollars for the bag . Other passengers had carry on that was very heavy and not weighed. The food served was ordinary porridge for dinner! Lots of sneezing passengers who see the magazine pocket in the seat in front as where to nose wiped tissues and cabin crew noticed and say nothing. This is not an airline for western tourists and should be avoided. The flight rates as one of my worst in over 30 years of travel. Best to avoid this airline and check with trip a deal if it is in the tour package !

### "Highly not recommend"
Not Verified |  The company charges extra money for the sport equipment, I had extra bag , I paid 140 dollars. And after during the boarding the airline worker sad that I should pay more 70 dollars, or I’ll not fly it’s the biggest price I ever paid for my sport equipment. Highly not recommend, and I never fly again

### "not be able to claim for Travel Insurance"
Booked 13 passengers from Spore to Chengdu dated 24 June 2023 to 16 July 2023. I received an message from my friend in Spore that there was a change of time schedule by Sichuan Airlines. We were scheduled to fly from Yushu to Chengdu on 16 July 23 (0900-1025) and will be taking Sichuan Airlines (1335-1830). But Sichuan Airlines changed the returned flight to 1020-1530 which we were not able to connect the flight. Checked with Trip.com why is there change of time schedule, Trip.com unable to ascertain the reason, and that was told that if I want the reason, I have to contact Sichuan Airlines. I therefore have to write in to Sichuan Airlines else I will not be able to claim for Travel Insurance. The official reason given by Sichuan Airlines was better planning of flight schedules. I find this reason not acceptable, I thought change of time schedule must be critical operational issues such as plane mechanical/technical reason run-way issue or military exercise. How can the airline changed the time schedule just for better planning, isn't this part of operational reason where there is standard operational procedure. The airlines must understand that tickets were booked and confirmed, we have to apply annual leave and permission granted by the employers. We have work commitment to return to work as schedule and some may even have training and meeting commitment. We have been travelling from Spore to Chengdu for the last 6 to 7 years via Silkair/SQ until the covid pandemic. As Singapore air has not resume the Chengdu flight, plus both China Eastern and China Airlines do not have direct flight, we therefore take the chance to travel by Sichuan Airlines. Chengdu to Spore -- flight was delayed for almost an hour because the luggage compartment door had some technical issue, we waited patiently -- the service crew was fast to react, they started to serve beverages to calm the passengers. Good service team must pair with good operational team.

### "no food and drink service during the flight"
Follow travel procedures carefully I traveled with them on the A350-900 from Cairo to Chengdu. Due to travel restrictions in China, there are procedures that must be followed in order to board the plane to travel to China with Sichuan Airlines. The ticket price is very expensive and ranges between five and nine thousand US dollars (for a one-way ticket from Cairo to Chengdu). It is difficult to buy tickets online, and you can buy them easily if you know someone in China who can buy them for you, or through the company's page on WeChat. If you are traveling from a third country to Egypt to travel with them, you must take PCR tests for coronavirus (COVID-19) three times within 48 and twenty-four hours before traveling in three different medical institutions recognized by the Chinese Embassy in that country, and if the result of the virus tests is negative, the Chinese embassy will give you Green light to travel to Egypt. Upon arrival in Cairo they will contact you to give you travel instructions that must be followed to travel to China from Cairo, and then they will add you to the group of travelers on WeChat, you must have an account on WeChat. You must take PCR tests for coronavirus (COVID-19) two times before traveling in two different medical institutions recognized by the Chinese Embassy in Cairo (they will give you the address, and name of the laboratories, and the date and time of the tests on WhatsApp). The first PCR test is conducted forty-eight hours before travel and starts from seven in the morning until ten in the morning. If the result of the PCR test is positive, they will add you to another group on WeChat, and you cannot travel. If the result of the PCR test is negative, they will not contact you, and you must do the test again on the day of travel. On the day of travel, the flight departs at around four o'clock in the afternoon. You must go to the laboratory to do a PCR test at exactly four o'clock in the morning. If the result of your examination is positive, they will cancel your travel and add you to another group on WeChat, if the result of the PCR test is negative, they will not contact you and you must go to the airport to complete your travel procedures. 7-You should apply for the Electronic Health Codes. You can fill in the information, declare your health status and upload relevant documents online. You must obtain it before traveling, and it is preferable that you do so upon your arrival at the Sichuan Airlines counter at Cairo Airport and before completing your other travel procedures. You must wear a hazmat suit, the airline staff will prevent you from boarding the plane if you are not wearing it, and it can be purchased from any medical supplies store in the Kasr Al-Aini area in Cairo at a cheap price. You must wear a face mask during the whole flight. The company does not provide food and drink service during the flight. Upon boarding the plane, you will find a plastic bag tied in front of your seat containing some snacks and a small bottle of water. You must tell the flight crew if you want to use the bathroom, as they sterilize it after any passenger uses it. In general, the flight from Cairo to Chengdu was quiet and comfortable.

### "playing refunding trick"
Los Angeles to Chengdu. Sichuan Airlines is playing refunding trick to all international flight customers, we have requested a ticket refund on 2/7/2020, and our tickets are eligible for a refund with a $100 refund cost. The airline shows refund pending for more than two weeks, then I called the airline, the rep says our tickets were passed the first refund check and waiting for second refund verification and that can take up to another 15 business days. this airline is playing refunding game by not giving the customer a clear refunding policy and that extremely long refunding period is cheating and hurting international travelers. All travelers who need to book with Sichuan airlines should book with credit cards that backed with protection (like most U.S. credit cards) just in case they will play the refund game forever, 2: check your refunds, you might forget and they might forget yours too!

### "Worst flight I ever had to China"
Not Verified |  We booked the flight because it was rather cheap on ctrip. 24 hours before departure my wife got a message that my flight from Changsha to Chengdu was cancelled and we should call the airline company. Due to Chinese New Year and the Corona-virus it was pretty hard to contact anybody, so we decided to take the car to the airport. At the airport, the ticket desk was unable to change my ticket, Sichuan Airlines was unable to change my ticket, so we had to call ctrip. After nearly 2 hours we got the schedule change and I was able to get an earlier flight. Would have wished the airlines had offered me the schedule change by themselves. Service on the flight Changsha-Chengdu was non-existent. I am not sure if that was due to turbulence or to the virus, but it was just a two-hours flight and I had brought some food of my own. In Chengdu I had to get my luggage and wait for 5 hours to check it in again, fortunately there is a good lounge for transit passengers at Chengdu Airport. At 11 p.m. the Sichuan Airlines counters got really busy as there were many flights departing. It was really crowded, but service was quite quick. I was pretty surprised when the flight to Rome got cancelled, maybe due to personnel shortage because of the virus. My gut-feeling says the flights to Prague and to Rome were pretty empty, so they cancelled one flight. Passangers to Italy got rebooked to our flight and even that one was not full. Seats were a bit narrow and my earphones did not work, but I was so tired (take-off at 2 a.m.) that I did not need any in-flight entertainment. Luckily, there was no food-service at the start, so passangers were able to sleep. The flight-attendants handed out bottled water and snacks, when I awoke I found snacks and water on the vacant seat next to me. Very thoughtful. 2 hours before landing they served breakfast. It was not a lot, we did not even get trays. It was Chinese food and I liked it, but for Europeans who cannot eat spicy food, the choice was not good. I am used to spicy food, but even I considered the breakfast to be quite spicy. No drinks were offered for breakfast. Luckily, I always try to get a seat near the galley, so I could get hot water during the flight for my tea. All-in-all, Sichuan Airlines was quite cheap, the aircraft semi-clean and in-flight-entertainment choices were okay. If you are not too tall and do not need to many amenities, I can recommend this airline. Worst flight I ever had to China, but still reasonably comfortable.

### "poor cabin hygiene"
Helsinki to Chengdu. Poor service, poor cabin hygiene, failure of air crew to maintain control over unruly passengers, seats reclined and bags on seats and everywhere during take off and landing. Food options no choice, only chicken noodles served with a set of a doughnut and salad. There was beef for the air crew to enjoy during their meal break. Air hostesses chatting loud during the flight, others cutting their nails at the same corner where food and drinks are prepared (photo attached) for the passengers. One hour and a half after taking off, a message was broadcasted telling passengers the aircraft will soon be taking off, therefore fasten seatbelts. One hour delay for the take off from Helsinki to Chengdu on that day, November 22nd, 2019. Even if this is the only option to fly directly from Helsinki to Chengdu, I would never opt for it again!

### "There is no customer service"
Helsinki to Copenhagen. This is kind of a disaster. I was suppose to fly with my brother and since Sichuan Airlines is a Chinese air company they don’t board those who has 1 entry Schengen area visa, which happened to my brother. Although the flight attendants were extremely rude and mean to us we didn’t say a word about that. It was on November, 4. We called to the hotline and got promised to get a full refund. However no one contacted us within 3 days as it was promised. I email them and got an answer that they will contact us within 3 days and I emailed 7 more times already and got the same answer. I called couple times to they got line but they don’t seem to speak English because apart from “sorry, we’ll contact you within 3 days” they can’t say anything at all. There is no customer service and people are just being ignored for months.

### "Sichuan Airlines is scamming us"
Los Angeles to Hi Chi Minh City via Hangzhou and Chengdu. The flight from LAX to HGH was normal and on time. Flight from HGH to CTU was delayed for about 1 hour. When we got to CTU, the Sichuan Airlines informed us that our connection left and refused to rebook us on the next flight. We will be stranded if we don't have money to buy ticket to transit to SZX. If we bought the ticket to transit, the rest of our trip, including the return trip, will be cancelled because we didn't complete the LAX to SZX trip even though it was their delayed flight issue. I had to buy new one way ticket to return to the USA on the return trip. Sichuan Airlines dumped it on Expedia saying that Expedia sold the ticket and they are responsible for everything. Like many other passengers who were on the same situation with me at CTU airport that day. We all agreed that Sichuan Airlines is scamming us. Instead of rebooking us on the next flight due to their own delay of the inbound flight.

### "service was impressive"
Auckland to Shanghai via Chengdu. The food was very good from a Chinese perspective. The service was impressive. The crew members were nice and passionate. Also, for transit in Chengdu, the passenger is able to claim 50 yuan voucher, free 24-hour baggage storage, free transit commendation in Chengdu. Based on this price, you cannot ask more. Thank you Sichuan Airlines for the wonderful memory.

### Sichuan Airlines customer review
Not Verified |  Beijing to Auckland via Chengdu. Horrible  experience from flight delayed, no accomodation provided, the manager at the airport doesn't speak English in Chengdu doesn't understand a word. No specific meal requirements we were told to go here and there wasting our time and energy, no clear info give or as part of service recovery for their flight being delayed for nearly 8 hours. My fault to trust Sichuan and booked because it was cheap - but you will go through a lot for the money paid. Way behind other competitors in market.

### "fly Sichuan in the future"
Auckland to Chengdu. Their cabin was fresh and clean and being a newer aircraft, was kept very well. The service is warm and professional. The seats fold flat and my kids slept for most of the 13 hour flight. We arrived relaxed and stress free considering that we had 2 young kids to look after and worry about. Night flights with kids are the way to go. The food was very tasty. The flight attendants were very polite and accommodating. They never made you feel you were a burden to them. I will happily fly Sichuan in the future.

### "recommend not to catch"
I was travelling from Melbourne to Kathmandu. I had two transit Chendung and Lasa. On flight to Chengdu I receive beef curry with rice however I ordered Hindu vegetarian meal. I ask for Hindu meal and air attendant replied me “we don’t serve Hindu meal. Really if you don’t serve why it’s in the option? I had one hour transit on Chengdu . One that time I have to claim my luggage go through immigration process standing on huge queue and drop my luggage and check in and pass through security area within one hours and there was no one to assist. Whenever we ask some one for help or anything same reply “no speak English “ “No English”. On Lasa I crossed the security area but mistakenly my partner’s visa slip was with me. I request one security office to give that to my partner who was standing on another side of security area. But security man as just saying “you go “ “you go” and he even physically push me on my shoulder. He was not even speaking basic English and becoming aggressive, unprofessional, manner less behaviour. Plane from Lasa to Kathmandu was smelling horribly, sit was very old and looked like old local bus. I request two sit together they provide one on row 14 and another on row 15. I will never catch any Chinese flight in my entire life and recommend not to catch.

### "stay away from this airline"
Los Angeles to Dalian via Jinan. I renewed my passport and I called to update my passport info. But the airline does not allow me to update my passport information. The only way to update passport is to cancel the ticket with charge. They said this is national policy. I recommend people stay away from this airline.

### " Something isn't right"
❎ Not Verified |  Chengdu to Taipei. I actually heard myself say out loud well into the flight that I will never fly this airline again. I fly a lot. Sometimes the service is great, sometimes not so great; sometimes the food is actually good, sometimes it's just barely edible and I don't really care and I never complain. But there was something about the rudeness, the abruptness of the staff that just annoyed me. I felt singled out as a westerner. Their English wasn't the best (which for an airline is unusual) but I speak some Mandarin so I can get around that and and usually Chinese seem to appreciate that. Not so this lot. The food was awful. Some kind of rancid pork fat suffusing the rice. I have a return flight today (which I would lose the money on) and I am at least this time mentally prepared. I certainly won't be getting on hungry. Nor will I be expecting a relaxing glass of wine and a smile from the girls. Are they actually trained like this? Something isn't right.

### "never fly this airline"
Shanghai to Sydney via Chongqing. The fleet is new and spacious. The thing I didn't like is food for the vegetarians. The food they provide is vegetarian vegan. No provision for the hot milk tea. In the night flight they even didn't provide dental care kit. The worst experience I had was at the Chongqing airport. Our flight from Shanghai arrived Chongqing at 9.25pm and we have to catch Sydney bound flight at 11.10pm. It was a nightmare for us that we have to collect our checkin baggage and then check in back for the Sydney flight. How can one accomodate all this within 2 hours, especially when there is no facility for the transferring passengers. We have to walk for 15 minutes outside the terminal to catch a free airport shuttle bus to take us to the international terminal. That was ridiculous and joke of the century. There were no officials present at chongqing who could direct us where to go. The shuttle bus came full and we have to wait for the next shuttle bus, very badly managed. Will never fly this airline especially through Chongqing.

### "I cannot complain too much"
Chongqing to Lanzhou. This was a typical standard of domestic flight in China. Flight was full as usual and the boarding process was not too bad. No IFE was available in Economy, no English literature or newspapers either but I was not expecting it. Meal service for the short flight was a simple fish or chicken option, with a few Chinese style snacks added in. I opted for Apple Juice but was a little disappointed on realising it was not 100% juice. Seat was okay with spacing a little tight. Overall, I got to where I needed to go for a decent price, so I cannot complain too much.

### "polite and well-trained attendants"
Ordinary short-haul experience from Dalian to Xuzhou with Sichuan Airlines. Quite affordable. Cheaper than CRH train. Polite and well-trained flight attendants. Free drinking water and snacks provided during the 70-minute flight. Economy class seats are not so spacious as expected. No Wi-Fi.

### "impressed by the quality of service"
I've been on many flights and I must say that I've been very impressed by the quality of service displayed by Sichuan Airlines. Cabin crew were very kind, and made me feel at home. Pilot flying skills were pretty good, I must say this was actually one of the most stable flights I've been on, with limited turbulence and I felt very safe.

### "is completely unacceptable"
Kunming to Los Angeles via Chengdu. Sichuan Airlines and the way it treats its customers is completely unacceptable. They not only cancelled our international flight last minute (one we had booked months prior) but refused to help us over customer service and gave us two terrible options, to either fly home two entire days later or get a refund. There was no way we could fly home that much later due to other commitments, health issues, and connecting flights so we were forced to take the refund. Even then, our refund has not come in and they are refusing to get back to us. They should not only have gotten our refund immediately but compensated us for having to pay for a last minute international flight. I have never been more frustrated and upset with an airline.

### "good value and great service"
Flew Sichuan Airlines from Melbourne to Chengdu. Clean plane, friendly staff and great service. Food was great, 2 options for Chinese or Western style catering. Comfortable seats, and clean bathrooms. Flights were on time for both flights. From Australia the Qantas Business Class Lounge was available to use and from Chengdu there was a lounge available. All aspects of the flight were great and I was really surprised at how good value and great service I received in this airline.

### "lunch was delicious and generous"
I was very pleased with the overall experience on my Nanjing to Chengdu flight with Sichuan Airlines. The staff went out of their way to speak to me in English. All announcements during the flight were in Chinese and English. Although a small tablet was provided in every seat pocket as the inflight entertainment, none of the content was in English. I did watch a movie (in Chinese) about a dog called "Snowee" and enjoyed it without fully understanding what was happening. The lunch served was delicious and generous.

### "do not take Sichuan Airlines"
Terrible experience. Just 4 days upon reaching Chengdu from Singapore, we were notified that our return flight was delayed for a day. We went to the airport to ask for statement of prove that our flight was delayed so as to submit our travel insurance claim. The customer service lady was totally unpleasant, not only was she reluctant to give us the statement, she also put down "company plans" as the reason for the delay. When we tried to clarify with her what is "company plans", she rudely retorted us with a "You have no right to know! Upon returning to Singapore we were notified by the insurance company that our claim was rejected because "company plans" is not considered a valid reason and were prompted contact the airline for clarification. I called the customer service hotline, bad attitude as expected. We were again denied the statement of proof as our flight was delayed for "company plans" hence they will not provide any proof. I wonder if this refusal to provide prove is just a ploy to hide their blatant disregard for their customers in their manipulation of flight schedules to maximise profits. Complete disregard for the rights of consumers and no actual intention of providing any good service. If you value your time, do not take Sichuan Airlines.

### "smelled cigarette smoke"
Chengdu to Hong Kong. I liked the staff, but twice I smelled cigarette smoke, I complained and the staff did nothing about it. She just explained it away, saying it comes from the outside while on the Tarmac. The second incidence occurred while in flight.

### "departure nearly an hour late"
Dayong to Chongqing with Sichuan Airlines. Very disappointed as previous experience with Sichuan Airlines had been positive. Flight departure time came and went without any indication of a problem - the plane had arrived on time and was well visible from the departure lounge. With an eventual chaotic bus-based boarding from a rearranged gate, departure was nearly an hour late. Staff appeared as browned off with life as the passengers.

### "crew were attentive and prompt"
Flew Sichuan Airlines from Kathmandu to Lhasa. Check in was quick though not friendly. The flight was delayed an hour but it happens to be a common occurence on this route. The Radisson lounge was okay but the staff seemed lazy and seemingly uninterested in providing quality service. Inflight meal served was breakfast which was below par for J class but the crew were attentive and prompt for this 1.25 hrs flight. No, reason given for the delay and the flight deck crew were mute the whole journey. This flight flies over the Nepalese himalayas and close to Everest but the crew never provided any info on when we were passing Everest which was a real let down. This sector is also regarded as one of the most expensive routes in the world when it comes to ticket price and flight time ratio.

### "no care or consideration"
Lhasa to Kathmandu, and Sichuan Airlines did not load my luggage onto the plane because the aircraft was overweight. They then gave me the run-around for several days in regards to when they would send on my luggage, and when I needed to leave the country they gave me false contact information. They have not communicated back to me, ignored every effort I've made to contact them and have shown no care or consideration whatsoever. I assume my luggage is now lost, although the airline won't even return any correspondence to confirm.

### "never being contacted"
Sydney to Shenzhen via Chongqing at an incredibly low price compared to Qantas and Cathay. The business class check-in at Sydney Airport was fairly slow. The Skyteam lounge was basic. No frequent flyer program available to accumulate miles into (except their own I guess). The cabin service with great crew. Business class seat was just an angled recline with no flat bed. Food was excellent but I tried the Chinese menu only with special chilli sauce. Cannot judge on the English proficiency of the crew as I spoke Mandarin Chinese onboard after reading previous English speaking passengers’ reviews. Sichuan Airlines cannot check the luggage through the final destination although within the same airline, nor ground transport existed in Chongqing airport at 4ish in the morning therefore I had to drag my bags from intl terminal to domestic for probably 500m on a 4-lane airport highway against the traffic with no pedestrian path existed, where the Sichuan airline counters is located at the furthest end of the domestic terminal. Lucky there was not much traffic at 4:30am. On another note, we had to wait on board upon landing before being allowed to leave the aircraft because the custom officers had not started working. Encountered problems with domestic security check as my booking on their system showed “internet booking” instead of a Chinese ID card number. Trouble started when there was a thunderstorm in Shenzhen with 200 flighted cancelled or delayed. No notification from airline by phone or email. They could not move me to an earlier flight on the same day that was still operating by Sichuan Airlines from Shenzhen to Chongqing. Only option offered was 3 days later with the same route back to Sydney. I therefore had to ferry to Hong Kong to catch a Singapore Airlines flight back to Sydney on the same day. I understand the airport chaos was beyond control of the airline due to bad weather, but the weather condition in Hong Kong was absolutely the same as it is a just neighbouring city a few miles away. Sichuan Airlines did offer me 50% refund for involuntary cancellation of the return journey. The refund however has not come back for 2 months for now. I chased them 3 times over the phone to China but was told each time they’d escalate and asked me to leave contact details. Never being contacted. They did not have any record of my contact details or previous conversations. I insisted to speak to the duty manager yesterday when I called and demanded for a follow up. This apparently has worked, and an email soon followed on the second day advising “pig, your refund has been approved, check your bank account in a week to confirm”. I don’t think I will deal with Sichuan Airlines again.

### "worst airlines I have been on"
Sichuan Airlines is one of the worst airlines I have ever been on. Coming home we board the plane to find it had no air conditioning working properly. With 300 people on board it became very uncomfortable to say the least. 1 hour later sitting on the plane with still no air and getting hotter by the minute. The crew could not care less, the air hostess pretended not to understand the westerners on the plane when we started to complain. It was not humane to have people on a plane in these conditions. 2 hours later the captain finally opens the door and tells 2 westerners to guard the door. Pretty bad to say the least, the food on the flights is uneatable so take your own. No flight entertainment - all in Chinese but half the plane is westerners. And the seats are designed for the small people. Do yourself a favour pay the extra 100.00 and fly a non Chinese airline.

### "completely ignore non-Chinese"
I would recommend that if you can, fly with someone else. Sichuan Airlines cabin crew completely ignore non-Chinese. Their manner borders on being rude and any request is not appreciated. English is very poor, the food is disgusting and inedible, service is poor (eg no pillow for non Chinese but plenty if you are). Entertainment in English is limited to one very old movie on the entertainment system that is so worn out that persistence is needed just to change the language setting. The best thing to watch is the aircraft tracker. The toilet was so filthy the cabin crew closed it down leaving one toilet for all travellers. We were with a travel group with return bookings. All reported the same on both legs of the trip with Sichuan Airlines so it wasn't just us. This airline and Chongqing International are no way ready for international tourism. We did take off on time and arrive safely so that does warrant something positive.

### "staff polite ... but English was restricted"
Shanghai to Melbourne via Chengdu with Sichuan Airlines. Relatively new and clean aircraft. Staff were polite and helpful, but English was restricted. Meals okay, except for 'breakfast' on return to Melbourne. No choice! Only a Chinese sort of rice with water (reminded me of descriptions of food served to POWs in Changi during the war! ), and was inedible - but the Chinese on board loved it. If Sichuan Airlines wants to fly to Australia and attract Western passengers, they have to offer a reasonable alternative, as they did on the trip Melbourne to China. We enjoyed a nice omelette for breakfast on that flight.

### Sichuan Airlines customer review
First class to Nanjing from Chengdu on 12th July 2015. Quick check in and a fast track through security to a seperate area. First class lounge was well stocked with drinks snd snacks, wi-fi was also good. We were placed on a minibus to the flight and boarded swiftly. I was served a drink and given a pair of slippers, greeted by lovely smiles of the stewardesses. Take off was 1 hour 30 minutes late due to problems at Chengdu air traffic control. Wide seats comfortable,  fell asleep in it for the delay. Leg room was great, recline could have been better though. After take off, we were given duvets which were soft and nice and a meal was served -  it was delicious.

### Sichuan Airlines customer review
My family and I traveled from Chengdu to Shanghai in comfort and on time. In fact we took off 5 minutes early and arrived 10 minutes early. The plane was modern and very clean. No issues with service at all. One of the stewardesses spoke good English and without prompting sought us out when the meal came to check we understood the choices. I would recommend this airline to anyone and will definitely choose to fly Sichuan Airlines when I'm next back in that neck of the woods.

### Sichuan Airlines customer review
Chengdu to Kunming. 2 minutes to check in and 15 minutes early departure which makes a change when compared to anywhere else where the 30-minute-delay is near obligatory. Bags waiting by the time I reached the carousel but beware the lengthy walk at Kunming.

### Sichuan Airlines customer review
We took this airline 3 times in China from Kunming to Yichang from Yichang to Chengdu and from Chengdu to Jiuzhaigou and all 3 flights were on time. The seats were wonderfully comfortable and there was a lot of leg room - I'm 5'11" and didn't feel cramped at all. Our favorite part was the beginning with a sort of "flying 101" video - just in Chinese but it was still hysterical. I loved the terrified plane that flew around the bad weather pattern. Then you got another fun video near the end of the flight. Any time I'm in China and have a choice to take Sichuan Air - that will be the one.

### Sichuan Airlines customer review
Shanghai to Chongqing 30 July 2013. Very efficient. A319 a little long in the tooth however spotless inside. Excellent leg room Arrival 10 minutes early with bags delivered a few minutes after arrival in hall. Choice of meals on offer.

### Sichuan Airlines customer review
Chengdu to Shanghai Pudong on A321. Flight slightly delayed due to weather. Lounge in Chengdu basic but better than sitting in departure area. Priority boarding and offered pre departure drinks of water or juice. Flight attendants were very courteous and obliging always smiling. The English was acceptable for a domestic flight. Dinner served on request and the food was reasonably good. Only limited selection of drinks beer wine water or juice but no spirits. Standard 2x2 seating with good pitch but limited recline. Overall a pleasant experience for 2.5 hours.

### Sichuan Airlines customer review
Vancouver to Shenyang on May 21 and back on May 28. Got off to a bad start - 10 hour delay! None of the information boards were updated in Vancouver. I checked at 7.45 am before heading off to YVR with the indicators having the incoming aircraft on time even though it had not then left Shenyang! Hotel accommodation and meals provided as the 11.30am take off time became 9.45pm. Flight was good. Business Class seats were comfortable with easy access to all power outlets. I slept all the way. Check-in at Shenyang was chaos no signs and airport representatives gave inconsistent advice. Eventually checked in and headed off to immigration only to have the staff member chase after me tell me to stop leap onto the luggage conveyor return minutes later with my once- checked bag and lead me off to another check-in desk devoid of staff. At 12.30 (take off was 2.30) staff appeared and began checking us in. Only after they had spent a full 15 minutes checking in the first passenger in line did the indicator boards confirm this was the Sichuan Airlines check-in! Passengers should be warned that check in opens only 2 hours before take off. Flight itself had excellent staff poor in-flight entertainment a good dinner a bad breakfast and an on-time arrival. First bags took 20 minutes to arrive but they were the priority bags at least. Direct service from YVR to Shenyang is a godsend for those of us bound for north eastern parts of China but Sichuan will need to increase its frequency upgrade its processes internationalize its in-flight entertainment and improve its food before people will readily defect from Star Alliance and Sky Team airlines. The equipment and in-flight staff are fine.

### Sichuan Airlines customer review
Chengdu - Lhasa 17 May. Overall I was impressed by the service. Efficient service good food and comfortable seats. A well maintained A330. No IFE though. But It's one of the better Chinese Airlines.

### Sichuan Airlines customer review
Travelled domestic first class Beijing to Chengdu. Price was very competitive and had the new A330-300 with lie flat seats very comfortable. Lunch was provided and consisted of traditional Sichuan food and very tasty beer and wine freely available. Staff were quite good and spoke English. Departed and arrived on time with the mandatory 20-30 min wait for take off in PEK. Entertainment system was poor with no real English movies or shows. Now they have started to fly non stop Melbourne to Chengdu I hope they improve their entertainment system other than that they have a good hard product staff catering and competitive pricing.

### Sichuan Airlines customer review
Chongqing to Wuhan. Flight delay of almost an hour due to fog in Wuhan. A320 used. A ham sandwich with a small bottle of water and Chinese tea served onboard.

Poor airline - pulled away from the gate then a passenger wanted off - she ran up to the front and wanted off the plane. So they pull back to the gate and delayed us 1.5 hours. On return back to Chengdu from Thailand boarded plane and our seats were taken by others. When we advised the stewardess our seats were taken she forced us to take a seat at the very back of the plane. After 10 mins of arguments we got our new seats at the back of the plane. Advise all foreigners not to use this airline.

First class Beijing-Chengdu-Shanghai. Check in at Terminal 3 was efficient and we were at the lounge in no time. Sichuan Airlines uses the Air China lounge which is ok but not spectacular. Boarding was on time but then we were held up for 2hours in the plane as so many flights were departing at the same time. The crew was attentive and friendly and kept coming around with drinks blankets etc. The crew wear very nice traditional Chinese uniforms and look very classy in comparison to other Chinese carriers. Once we departed they served dinner which was ok for a domestic flight. Again the crew was very attentive and delivered great service. Seats on the A320 have a rather narrow seat pitch for F class and are not made for flights longer than 3hours.We arrived 2h late and had to wait ages for our luggage. The flight to Shanghai was on the latest A330 which had lie flat seats. The plane was brand new and the seats great. I could get almost 1h30min sleep on this 2h30min flight. Crew again very friendly and attentive. Food was disgusting however. Was really disapointed. Sichuan Airlines is the airline to choose if you travel to this region of China.

CTU-PEK and PEK-CTU. Food served was a full and delicious meal. Crew took great care in its appearance where toilets were kept clean after each use. Also food was served with classic Sichuan sauce of Lao Gan Mah making it a very authentic and genuine experience. Would recommend this airline to anyone flying domestically in China to and around CTU.

Bussed it from HK to Sichuan to take a 737 to Beijing. Everything up to scratch and with Sichuan as the airline's home base there were plenty of check-ins and help available. A little bemusing when the music starts and everyone begins their (getting into) shaping exercises. Best to hide behind your newspaper!

Shanghai PVG to Chengdu in economy. Check in through MU-staff usually grumpy but got requested emergency exit. As usual gate was changed and flight delayed by the usual 45 min. Clean A320. I am 6ft 6 and had way enough legroom! Emergency exit proved to be only 2nd row behind the exit door seats but legroom still ok. Shortly before take off was asked if I speak Chinese. As I denied I was quite straight told I should move this is a Chinese flight I should move 1 row behind. Ok no problem (The emergency exit seats were then occupied by 2 elderly Chinese ladies of which I doubt there were strong enough to open the door not to say help other passengers). After boarding plane sat another 20 min or so on the parking position. FAs went round to distribute Chinese Newspapers a single FA came running with an English copy of China Daily for me. After take off plenty of drink runs however no beer and food was absent did not manage to find the reason. Were handed small bags with dried beef and dates but I was really hungry. After landing plane was parked on the tarmac had to take a 10min busride to the terminal. Overall pleasant and nice I am amazed to find this level of service and friendliness at a Chinese airline. Will fly them again and can refer them without hesitation to be one of the best Chinese airlines.

Chengdu to Yichang in an ERJ-145. The smallest jet I've flown in with 2-1 seating. The service was basic with water peanuts and sour dates. Some passengers with larger carry-on luggage were asked to check it in just prior to climbing up the boarding stairs. My daypack was allowed through possibly because it was on my back. It fits under the seat anyway but this should be a consideration for passengers travelling on this flight. English announcements reasonable and a smooth flight with good views of Chengdu.

Round trip from Chongqing to Chengdu. Clean nicely appointed plane interior friendly staff on time departures and arrivals plus a free Shuttle Bus greeted us on the tarmac at Chengdu avoiding travel into the airport building. Because the plane had small interior seating 1x2 we had to check-in our carry-on luggage but when we deplaned they brought the checked luggage to the Shuttle Bus. On our return to Chongqing there was a free Airport Shuttle Bus three blocks from our Hotel.

Shanghai HongQiao to Chengdu in-flight safety checking seatbelts checking overheads warning otherwise unruly Chinese passengers best service and food I've had on a flight. Service quality as good as AA business.

Beijing to Chengdu 23 June 2004 Economy Class. From a carrier I hadn't heard of before on a domestic flight in China I did not expect anything above average standards. However the service was excellent. The plane had an attractive interior the staff were pleasant and smiley and the food was outstanding. My meal seemed to be a fusion of western and Chinese - spicy beef served with small potato chips - and it was delicious. Definitely the best airline food I've ever had. After this flight I vowed to always fly Sichuan Airlines given the chance even though unfortunately this is unlikely. The best short haul airline no one's heard of. It's a shame they don't do long haul flights.
