### “staff friendly and professional”
I found Olympic Air to be a perfectly nice little airline to hop around Greece on. I took several flights in May/June. The review is for the flight from Athens to Alexandropoulis. As with the other flights, the ATR aircraft was very clean and the staff friendly and professional. My only advice to anyone reading this review is that you don't sit in the last row of the aircraft. Seat pitch on an ATR is never very good, and the last row has half that amount. Expect a bone-crunch flight if you are anything above 4ft. At 6ft4 I could not even sit down because my knees could not fit in the six inch space between my seat and the seat in front (I measured it). The airline should not even be allowed to sell these seats to passengers. Fortunately the FA eventually saw my predicament and moved me to another, more normal seat further up the aircraft so the flight was fine after that. As with all Olympic flights, you get a bottle of water and a biscuit.

### “exceptional customer service skills”
I used Olympic Air to fly from Athens to Paros and return. The aircraft used was an immaculately clean ATR72 that despite its 10 year of age, seemed brand new. It seems the airline is really focusing on maintaining the cabins pristine. The cabin crew consisted of 2 flight attendants on each leg, groomed to perfection and showcasing exceptional customer service skills. A very short flight of roughly 30' and we were offered water and sweets! This is quite the rarity these days and highly appreciated treated as a guest and not simply as just another passenger. Flights departed with a slight delay due to the air traffic restrictions but made up most of the time lost during flight. Bags arrived on time and very prompt. I would definitely recommend this legendary brand and i am so happy to see it operating in such high standards even on such short flights.

### "will never fly with them again"
Naxos is a very small airport (one gate small). As we all were waiting to board we saw the airport crew load all the luggage, 15 mins goes by and they all were talking with each other and something looked wrong. Then we saw the pilot come around and talk with the crew, this went on for about 5 more minutes. We were about 15 minutes delayed at this point. Then the crew starts unloading the luggage, so all of us waiting figured the flight was getting canceled. Nope, they started boarding us. Several of us asked multiple ground crew and on plane staff "What's going on with our luggage? No one would answer or even acknowledge. Get to Athens and no luggage. Not a surprise as we saw them pull our bags and we have tile trackers in them. Stand in line hour plus to file out claim. Zero care from any staff that over half our flight is filing claims. This might be a few days" we get told. If you have already left the country they will be shipped to your home in a few weeks. Get told we will get updates via text message and email. Need to spend our first night in Athens shopping for clothes and necessities for the next day. Wake up with no updates from the airline but my location tag says it was at the port of Naxos (not the airport, the boat port). A few hours later my wife's bags location tag says port of Paros, a different island. Still no updates from Airline. My wife and I do a tour, in our new clothes, and after see our location tags at Athens airport. Still no communication from Airline. We call twice and are on hold for 30 minutes each time with no answer and their system hangs up on you after 30 minutes. We go have late lunch and think about driving the 45 minutes to the airport to get them ourselves. Decide we will call one more time when we get back to hotel. When we get back, our luggage is sitting in lobby of hotel. Never once was contacted by Airline. We will never fly with them again and will advise everyone we know to stay away as well.

### "What a great flight"
What a great flight of 1 hour and 45 minutes. Aircraft was clean, departure was on time and crew was very friendly. Legroom is reasonable for such a small plane. No IFE or wifi, but inflight service was very good with 2 options of sandwiches, juices, coffee, and chocolate

### "a nice experience"
A short and very pleasant morning flight. Efficient boarding (airport is small), nice seats. Professional staff, which served water and a sweet. Very soft landing. All in all a nice experience, meeting again the high expectations for Aegean/Olympic Air.

### "flight has been awful"
This flight might go down as the worst ever. The flight was over 1.5 hours late. That is not the bad part. The bad part is that all passengers were brought outside and we had to wait at least 45 minutes in the BLAZING sun. No water as we were thru security and there is no place to get water. I seriously thought that I was going to faint from heat stroke. The customer service from the time I booked my flight has been awful.

### "Both flights were on time"
Both flights were on time, friendly crew and there was an inflight service for this 25 minutes flight. Airplane was clean. Due to short runway only 25 passengers could board on departure from Kastellorizo.

### "have lost our money for both flights"
Two friends independently booked flights for 9th October online. The website automatically moved the flights to 10th October without telling us because the 9th was unavailable. We only became aware that they had done so when we received the booking confirmations. Immediately we called the call centre, who refused to cancel or refund the flight, so we have lost our money. I contacted them through Twitter, but they continued to blame us, refusing to accept that the website had automatically moved it. We are both not stupid people, and would not have independently made the same mistake, but that is what is implied. We have lost our money for both flights through no fault of our own. Customer service is awful. To clarify - we did not take the flights, so I cannot comment on ground service, seat comfort, etc.

### "our baggage was not there"
We had a flight from Sofia to Paros with a connecting flight from Athens. Everything was fine until they changed our return ticket from 21.00 to 07.00. When we checked in our baggage everything seemed fine, they told us that we dont need to pick it up at Athens, it will be directly transported to Paros Airport. When we arrived our baggage was not there, we reported this problem and the lady at the counter was extremely impatient. We asked her if she knows an estimate time or any indication when this will be fixed and how long does it usually take. She advised 24 hours. 24 hours have passed and we still do not have our baggage. We tried calling the number they provided us - no answer. We called the airline support - no help at all, they couldnt do anything since they were from a different department. After calling more than 30 times the baggage support number, on the next day some lady picked up. They advised that we can buy something for 40€ per day, but lets be honest, 40€ cant even handle my pants in this resort. Awful service. Our trip is ruined.

### "Unfortunately when arriving in Athens no bags"
Heads up for anyone planning travel in the Greek Islands. After visiting 3 Greek islands our last stop was Athens flying from Naxos to Athens on Olympic Air. Short flight, very convenient, and reasonably priced compared to Ferry option. Unfortunately when arriving in Athens no bags. This is a typical practice by Olympic as the small planes quickly are over weight limits and if you are unlucky no bags when you arrive. In our case the bags are being put on the Ferry and will arrive 3 days later. Not a great situation when on holiday. Strongly encourage folks to think about this risk when taking these short flights between the islands.

### "will not refund any thing"
Not Verified |  My travelling partner tested positive for COVID 2 days before the flight and we were then unable to travel. Called the airline immediately - 4 times never got through - finally did - a curt and snappy agent - told us there was no chance to do anything. Will charge you for cancelling, will not refund any thing, will charge you again to move to a different date. Paid for extra bags, no refund, taxes paid will not be refunded. 300 euro paid for 2 people for a one way flight lasting 30 minutes.

### "Queue for check-in, delayed flight"
Rhodes to Athens delayed by 42 mins. Very sad to see the delays in Olympic Air flights. Queue for check-in, delayed flight, barely any checking of my COVID vaccination status for domestic flight, no parking at jetway gates, no air conditioning in airport buses in 40 degrees. The cabin is still operated very well and the flight attendants are very helpful.

### "too big for carry-on luggage"
We arrived to the ticket counter at 5am to get our boarding passes, there were 7 of us. The person attending looked at our luggage and said only one of our luggage was too big for carryon so we paid $25 eoros to check it in. When we arrived to the gate and were about to board they attendant said that 4 other of our luggage were too big for carry-on luggage, same luggage we had on carry-on on 4 other flights we took to get to Santorini. Because we did not pay at the counter it would be 40 euros per luggage. I told the attendant that the person in the ticket counter told us they were ok for carry-on, and that person was actually also now helping with boarding so I pointed to her. One was the person in the ticket counter and the other identified herself as the supervisor. We talked to her telling her that 40 euros was extreme when we could have paid 25 euros at the ticket counter, it was like talking to the wall. She didn't look at us and really didn't care what we were saying. They did that to 4 other people that were also tourists. Its seemed like they were deliberately misleading people to charge more money. It was very upsetting because the flight had so much space available for our luggage. They should train their staff with better customer service.

### "had to document the luggage for 40 euros"
At check in, the agent reviewed our carry on luggage and said it was fine to take to the airplane. But the door another agent said it was too big and we had to document the luggage for 40 euros. We explained the situation but agents at the door keep ignoring us, just wanted the payment. The plain had many empty seats and a lot of room for carry on luggage but none of that matter.

### "must make passengers feel secure"
I flew for business from Kavala to Athens. For a domestic flight I paid the same price as for going to Paris or Frankfurt. They packed us in a tiny airplane filled with passengers. Between the arrival and its departure there was not enough time to disinfect the aircraft. During the flight some passengers had brought their own dinner on board, spending as a result almost all the flight without masks in a jam packed environment. As if this was not enough when arrived in Athens they packed us in busses in order to reach the airport. Very disappointed. If companies want to survive the pandemic in the long term, they must make passengers feel secure.

### "All Covid measures applied"
Not Verified |  Chios to Athens. Nice flight. Economical ticket. All Covid measures applied. Friendly staff. Gave us a treat. Professionalism. Arrived earlier than scheduled. Punctual and always with a smile. Will certainly fly with Olympic Air again.

### "smiling and courteous cabin crew"
Not Verified |  Efficient and polite check-in at Athens Airport, buses used to access aircraft for boarding. Greeted at aircraft door by smiling and courteous cabin crew who tried to keep order when passengers were finding their seats but the problem was that people were not listening to crew instructions and were not maintaining social distance. Many were British tourists I'm sorry to say. Very short flight, just 20 minutes and we landed early. Polite goodbye from crew. Nice flight.

### "the staff were quite unfriendly and rude"
Most unpleasant flight ever. Their method of boarding the plane wasn’t very Covid-19 friendly so if you are someone who is concerned I wouldn’t recommend you travel on this airline. Most airlines board back to front to keep crossing paths with others to a minimum. Where as this airline boarding all window seats, then all middle, the all aisle seats together in bit seat order meaning that there were about 40+ people all trying to get ton in each bath and crossing paths. They also wouldn’t let you use the overhead lockers above you which causes you having to walk up and down the aisles to find space and then squeezing past people to get back to your seat. The worst thing about the journey was the staff were quite unfriendly and rude. If you want to ruin a relaxing holiday and come back stressed - 10/10 would recommend,

### "find reasons to charge you more"
I flew with Olympic air from Crete to Athens. They have an inconvenient website which is not very clear of what baggage is allowed. When you go for bag drop the crew, with attitude find all the reasons to charge you more. I will avoid to fly with them from now on.

### "staff was unaware of such visa"
I and two of my friends had a flight from Santorini to Athens. I had a long term schengen Visa which allowed me to roam the European union before I came to Santorini where my Visa was checked multiple times. Turned out the ground staff was unaware of such visa. Thanks to one person among those who let me in. Then one of the air hostess skipped me for the chocolates and cookies. Though I don't have any complaints from other air hostess who were friendly and fine.

### "Great service and great people"
The self check in was extremely busy especially because of the congestion at the Athens Airport. However, Aegean/Olympic agents were helpful and move me fast. Flight was on time and the ATR was clean, comfortable; food service and beverages was very generous. I found out that the Athens-Malta leg is run under the Olympic brand and they feed you well. Indeed, they announced Olympic when they went on air, but I was holding a Aegean Ticket. This is when I found out that its a double brand. We arrive on time in Malta. It was an ATR aircraft so I was not expecting any sort of in-flight entertainment and WiFi. Its was a short leg. I would love to fly Aegean/Olympic again. Great service and great people, distinctively Greek.

### "charge of 70 euros for luggage"
Heraklion to Athens. My husband and I were very disappointed with the unexpected charge of 70 euros (35 each) for our luggage. We were on our way back to Athens from Heraklion after almost 2 weeks of travelling to different islands with our 2 luggage (where are you supposed to leave them?). Finally, we were returning to Athens to catch our flight home and the attendant at the desk told us we had to pay for the luggage. After trying to explain to her, unsuccessfully, the situation, she kept going in circles. Where’s the courtesy to tourists who are coming to the country to spend their money, sounds like abuse to me. Well, I know I sound bitter, and I am. I don’t think is fair.

### "last minute delays"
Chania to Athens. Be aware of this airline delays. I lost 1 day of my 4 days vacation due to their last minute delays. It's sad that during summer morning flights should be delayed.

### "other flight wouldn’t wait"
Santorini to Istanbul via Athens. Santorini flight to Athens delayed 2 hrs. The other flight in transit from Athens to Istanbul same airline (Olympic / aegean) wouldn’t wait although only around 30 mins behind schedule. In result, they gave us another flight 9 hrs later from Athens to Istanbul. And as a result, we couldn’t able to catch our third flight from Istanbul to ASR. We had to deal with the flight to ASR ourselves with Turkish airline. They cannot able to help although they are partners. We had to get the flight on the next day to ASR from Istanbul. All the things planned and hotel are ruined.

### "Worst check-in experience"
Athens to Sitia. Passengers are forced by ground staff at ATH to use the self-tagging system of luggage without any efficient help or guidance. Response of indifferent handling agents: “It is the company’s policy”. Worst check-in experience ever. Cabin crew should better get rid of haughty attitude towards passengers and shape up with some professionalism…

### Olympic Air customer review
Not Verified |  Athens to Chios. The staff was very nice and polite. How short the flight may be, 45 min. including take off and landing, they were still serving snacks and refreshments. I am a tall person, 1,85, so the seats were a bit small, but that was no problem at all. Because it is a small airplane. When our baggage was delayed last year, it was handled very well, they flew it in the same day on the next flight. Over all it isn't for nothing that it is the best domestic airline!

### "flight itself was fine"
Rhodes to Athens with Olympic Air. The flight itself was fine. The A320 was clean, with those typical hard-cushioned thinner type seats albeit with good legroom. You also get a free sugar kick via a paper cup of coke, a cookie and a candy in a swift non-dentist-friendly service which is not much, yet already 3x more than what you get on an LCC. Engaged FAs with a certain flair also add to the appeal. The problem was that the flight was delayed for over an hour yet no one considered it a good idea to inform people already queing up at the gate. It was only 5 mins after the original departure time (still on the gate screen) that a ground handling lady showed up to inform passengers that the plane hadn't taken off yet from Athens, so she couldn't really say when we would fly. Why on earth would A3 just let people go airside at what is easily one of the busiest airports per square ft, just to try to find a spot to seat for hours with no info? And even if the airport staff at Rhodes is overwhelmed, why don't you use the app to inform passengers? As I type this, I see that the Sunday flight was also an hour and 15 mins late. Is that a pattern? Bottom line, if you are booking your flights independently, allow plenty of slack for your connecting flights as high season ramps up.

### "Seat space was so limited"
Olympic Air flight from Athens to Rhodes was operated by Aegean. The flight departed on time and reached destination on time. No food or beverages served on 1 hour flight. Seat space was so limited. Very disappointing.

### "better service, lower price"
Direct flight a new service from Athens to Catania and return. It was full of Italian tourists returning home. I asked them why they do not travel with Alitalia. They replied that they got better service, lower price and they do not have to go via fiumicino.

### "there are always problems"
Kefalonia to Athens. I fly Olympic regularly between Athens and Kefalonia and there are always problems. This trip, the online check in failed. At the airport I had to pay 5 euro for extra leg room and it took them an hour to process the payment. Then I was told the plane was so full my hand baggage had to go in the hold. The plane was not full and there was plenty of space in the overhead storage. Needless to say, the flight was late and on arrival in Athens the baggage took a long time to arrive. Avoid if possible.

### "the worst airline"
Myself and my girlfriend had a flight from Milos to Athens today 27/08/2018 arriving at 2pm to catch another 2 connection flights to Slovenia from Athens. For some reason the aircraft was small for the number of passengers booked in that flight, so they decided to leave us out together with some other passengers, giving 250 euros to compensate this mistake. The problem is we had to buy new flights for tomorrow morning which cost 700 dollars plus the accomodation and transport in Athens, plus I've been trying to contact their customer service for over 3 hours and no one picks the phone. It was definitely the worst airline I have dealt with.

### "not recommend this airline"
I had my flight booked in the evening at 23:00 from Chania to Athens. Due to unforseen circumstances my partner had to leave earlier in the morning to a different destination. I was at Chania airport from 11am for that reason and I asked at the Olympic Air desk about availability of earlier flights instead of waiting alone till 11pm at the airport. I found the staff very unhelpful reporting that there are seats left at the 18:00 flight but I have to pay 60 euros extra fee for the change of flight. I was expecting a little bit more understanding, especially since they saw me standing there all day in front of them until 5pm. I value kindness and morality above money, but clearly this is not the case for this company. I would not recommend this airline for that reason.

### "I would fly again"
Athens to Catania. Direct excellent flight, everything was on schedule, departure, flight time and arrival at Catania Airport. Service was excellent though not enough space in the aircraft. This is why the airplane was fully booked from Italian tourists. I would fly again. I saved valuable time instead of flying via Rome.

### "Cabin crew were friendly"
Athens to Tirana. After 4 hour waiting in Athens the smooth boarding process started. Bus transfer to the propeller aircraft. The flight was full and just took 1 hour 20 minutes. Usually on such short intra european flights there is no inclusive meal service. To my surprise, direct after take-off a sandwich was served with free beverages, beer or wine. Thereafter coffee or tea with a small cookie. Like european flights 20 years ago. Cabin crew were friendly and we landed on time in Tirana.

### "it was a pity that the flight was so short"
Flew Milos to Athens. I always like to fly Olympic Air (and Aegean) because I love the product these airlines offer, and this flight fulfilled my expectations. First of all the flight time is not even 25 minutes. The cabin was very clean and fresh, we had a great flight attendant who was a shining example for the industry: professional, friendly and caring. She handled (alone!) the fourty-seater, fully booked plane effortlessly. It is amazing that on such a short hop you get a choice of beverages and a snack. Great Job Olympic, it was a pity that the flight was so short.

### "Highly recommended"
Kavala to Athens. Flight departed on time. Smooth boarding. Crew were extremely professional and polite. Snacks and beverages were served. Smooth arrival at Athens International Airport. Baggage delivery was fast. Highly recommended.

### "friendly services rendered"
Very good organization and attitude from Olympic Air flight staff. Continous non stop service from Athens to Thessaloniki and wide variety of drinks, foods and beverages. Short flight however all passengers were smiling with the friendly services rendered. Reached destination earlier than the scheduled time. I would travel again.

### "Crew very professional"
Athens to Belgrade. Flight booked with Aegean Airlines but operated by Olympic Air. Relatively small aircraft for a short route (Athens to Belgrade) and a bit slower than jets, however it was pretty pleasant and the bonus is that there is no middle seats and also the views were great. Some Israeli passenger were pretty worried and a bit aggitated, as some friends were coming from another (connection) flight and they had not showed up, however the crew informed them that that the aircraft would be waiting for them and they would not miss the flight. They were pretty professional and the 3 connecting passengers showed up. The aircraft departed with a minimal delay of 10 minutes and landed almost on time. Althouh they charge for checked luggage and the aircraft is small, the situation was pretty ok. Relatively good size baguette was served, which tasted well, a sweet snack and 2 rounds of drinks. Crew very professional. Buses were used on both airports - this aircraft is not compatible with bridges. to sum up it was a nice and comfortable flight. Totally recommended!

### "experience summed up as marvellous"
Heraklion to Athens. After a rather fast bus boarding procedure and a kindly welcome by the cabin crew, the plane took off in time. The breakfast was excellent for a 40 minutes flight: warm criossants, a delicius cappucino with a perfect milk froth, greek yoghurt, local vegetables and a variety of cheeses which came along with chocolates, and several other snacks; not to mention the large options of beverages. The flight experience can be summed up as marvellous!

### "service is exemplary"
Connection from Athens to Zante with Olympic Air. Although the flight was marginally delayed we still managed to arrive on time on the island. These internal short hop flights are always full but service is exemplary, plane clean and a pleasure to utilise for Greek island "hopping! Same again in 2017 for my annual visit.

### "cabin crew very helpful"
I flew Olympic Air from Athens to Chios. The cabin crew was very helpful and I was amazed that snacks and drinks were served in such a sort flight (about 25 mins). The pilots were very informative and performed perfect landing despite strong winds. The aircraft was very clean. I would fly with Olympic Air again.

### "crew service was excellent"
Olympic Air takes most of the flights within the Greece. Even though the flight was very short, around 30 minutes, crew service was excellent. The weather was bad, severe turbulence and the steward was outstanding. He manages to calm us down even though the flight was not very pleasant due to the bad weather. The plane was the one with propellers which was a little loud, but it is fun. Due to the bad weather they did not any snacks or drinks, but we did not care, we just wanted to land in one piece. The view from the plane was marvellous while we were landing, the nature in Greece is wonderful. And overall, we were very satisfied with the service of Olympic Air.

### Olympic Air customer review
We have flown with Olympic Air twice, once was from Athens to Kefaloania, and the 2nd time was from Zakynthos back to Athens. Both were pleasant. The crew, food, drinks, service and view out the window was great. Would fly Olympic Air again.

### Olympic Air customer review
Flight attendants were very polite and helpful. It's aircraft are not very well preserved (the interior of the aircraft). The seats were comfortable but you could see they where a bit worn at their edges, also the windows are very blurry and scratched.

### Olympic Air customer review
Took a quick 45-min flight from Athens to one of the Greek Isles (Milos) and was pleasantly surprised. A very good price, both to/from flights departed on time, cabin crews were extremely friendly and did a quick beverage service. The flight is by propeller plane (plane itself was dated) and has maybe 20 seats total, and does bus to runway boarding. Overall a very good experience and was the same price, though like 4 hours faster than taking a ferry from Athens so I'd definitely recommend the trip.

### Olympic Air customer review
Traveling from Samos to Lesvos with a transfer at Athens Airport. We went through the airport of Samos pretty fast we had too many bags with us so we needed to pay an extra fee which was 30 euros for each suitcase (didn't care about the weight) which I find a very fair price. Flight attendants were very kind and even for this short flight (25min) to Athens they came around with a drink and a snack. The stopover in Athens was not very useful for us because we transferred to another gate to end up on the same plane we had came from with exactly the same cabin crew. Overall a good experience would recommend it to others.

### Olympic Air customer review
ATH-SOF on Q400 (noisy plane). During the 1 hour 5 min flight they offered sandwich refreshments or wine and coffee / tea with a croissant. Food was very bad and tasteless. Staff was professionals and friendly. Flight was on time. Appearance of plane was clean.

### Olympic Air customer review
The check-in process for this super quick 30 min flight from Santorini to Athens on a Dash 8 plane was shockingly disorganized! Once we got on board though they actually managed to serve drinks and peanuts which impressed me for such a short flight.

### Olympic Air customer review
JMK-ATH A3 377 7 Aug 2014. Flew Mykonos - Athens on a clean Dash 8. Welcomed on board by very polite and smiling cabin crew. Despite the fact the flight time was only 20 minutes a full drink service was offered with napkins ice and peanuts. The 2 Flight Attendants never looked stressed or hassled and full marks to the Purser for her excellent PA announcements made in Greek and very good English. Upon landing again the goodbye and thank you greeting was given with sincere smiles and professionalism. Shall definitely fly Olympic again.

### Olympic Air customer review
Flew on the 16th of June Athens to Mykonos. Very short 35 min flight on a dash 8 Q400. Staff were courteous and happy to help (on ground and inflight). Regardless of the short flight drinks and some peanuts were served which was a nice touch considering how short the cruise time was (roughly 5 minutes) before descent started.

### Olympic Air customer review
Our flight was scheduled for 1450hrs but we were delayed at security screening due to the long queue and we came from a connecting flight. When we rushed to the boarding gate at 1440hrs we were unable to board. The gate controller wanted to help us but somebody on the other end of her walkie-talkie refused to let us board. The bus driver was waiting to rush us to the plane but in the end everything was in vain. We had to get another pair of tickets for a next day flight and spend the night at the airport as a result. The plane did not even attempt to wait for us but preferred to take the time to offload out luggage. In all experiences flying although not required all airlines planes have always given an unspoken grace period of perhaps 5-10 mins for late passengers some even longer as connecting passengers have to rush through gates. We would not have gone past 5 mins boarding time and Olympic Air refused to wait. We forfeited a booked hotel night stay and had a bad experience with getting another ticket.

### Olympic Air customer review
Very quick 40 minute flight from Athens to Mykonos and back. Great helpful staff and they tried to serve a drink each way and a snack but ran out of time. New aircraft and comfortable economy seating.

### Olympic Air customer review
Flight from Athens to Vienna in business class. Very nice service from the crew and a fantastic breakfast. Aircraft was a new airbus A319.

### Olympic Air customer review
Flight from Milos to Athens. Aircraft dash 8-100 old but with a clean cabin. Very good service for a 35 mins flight.

### Olympic Air customer review
Flew OA on 21st July Athens - Corfu route. Flight operated by bombardier Q800 aircraft. Before take off cabin was too hot. Airplane is not convenient if you have special needs. Aisle was very thin and the toilet was so small it was hard to move with the door closed. I will avoid this airline.

### Olympic Air customer review
From Athens to Santorini. The flying time was so short around 35 mins. But served cookies and hot drinks. The flight departed from Athens on time. Flight announcement was clear and correct.

### Olympic Air customer review
SMI-ATH-SMI route (once or twice a month). OA uses small Bombardier airplanes whose seats do not recline. There is enough leg space (I am 185cm) and the seat width is fine. There is no inflight entertainment. The personnel has always been very polite and helpful. The only problem with OA are the outrageously high prices for its domestic flights especially for destinations like SMI where there is no competition.

### Olympic Air customer review
I fly with Olympic Athens-Istanbul-Athens twice a month for the last 3 years and I'm very satisfied. They provide nice meals (even on short flights). What I dislike is that they partially switched to the Dash 8 Q 400 turboprops from the A320 for some destinations (Istanbul included sometimes). I'd recommend them.

### Olympic Air customer review
Athens-Limnos on a Q400. Check in quick and efficient. Boarding by bus but quite efficient too. The flight left five minutes early and arrived 15 minutes early. It was smooth and the friendly crew worked very hard to get everyone a drink and nuts on this 40-min flight. There was ample leg room. A good experience.

### Olympic Air customer review
ATH-BEG-ATH with Q400 both flights were 5-7 minutes late. When I was web-check in I forgot the type of the aircraft and I checked a seat on the sun side. That is a problem because the aircraft has no shades. The service was excellent with very friendly staff but with an unfriendly / noisy aircraft.

### Olympic Air customer review
Took a flight from Belgrade to Athens which was fairly empty. Friendly ish crew who brought a seemingly never ending supply of drinks plus a snack comprising a nice-enough sandwich and a delicious chocolate croissant. All on time.

### Olympic Air customer review
ATH-LRS-SMI-ATH. Olympic has improved very much over the years: good check-in with friendly agents. Onboard smart cabin crews who provide a good and smiling service. The transfer of our luggage to Paris was perfect I would fly them again.

### Olympic Air customer review
I have to admit to being somewhat concerned about booking Olympic Air but Aegean was very expensive in comparison. So I booked 2 tickets to/from Athens to Heraklion. The web-site was easy to navigate and the process simple. We did have one slight schedule change on our outbound flight which didn't affect our plans. We checked-in on-line the day before each flight and printed our boarding cards bag drop was easy to find and our bags were taken quickly. Boarding in Athens a bit late but we made up the time en route. Aircraft in both directions a Q-400 which was bright and clean. We didn't expect anything on-board but were surprised to be served a beverage and a packet of nuts/cookie. Cabin crew were well presented and couldn't do enough. All in all a great experience.

### Olympic Air customer review
I have just returned from Zante and I found that both flights were what I'd expect from any other company. Seats were comfortable however there was not much leg room. Flights were on time both inbound and outbound although there was a flight to Manchester with Olympic at the same time as ours to Gatwick which was delayed overnight.

### Olympic Air customer review
Flew Mykonos to Athens with Olympic Air in Premium Economy. Check in was polite and efficient. Aircraft was clean inside and out had seat 3A. Pre take off drink was served. Left on time and a filling and tasty snack of pasta salad and a cake was served with a drink by 2 polite and professional cabin crew. A very comfortable flight and we landed on time. Would recommend Olympic Air and would choose them again.

### Olympic Air customer review
I am a Gold member in both Greek airlines (Aegean-Olympic Air) traveling over 100 times a year and I have to admit that Olympic Air is below expectations especially in Ground services (Lounges - Luggage priority services). They must: Renovate their Lounges in Athens Airport as soon as possible. Dramatically improve their Luggage priority service. Improve their unacceptable prices and value for money for local flights.

After an extreme delay in Milan on Aegean and missing my flight to Mykonos I was rebooked on Olympic Air. I took my new ticket and other Aegean info the Olympic counter to check in as I was told. I had been up all night with no sleep and after handing the agent the new tickets and my passport and my old Aegean ticket he literally threw it back at me and said "you are flying Aegean not Olympic" and rolled his eyes. After a deep breath I informed him I had been rebooked and he then asked why I didn't show him the new ticket in a nasty tone. I informed him I handed him the new ticket with my passport and if he took time he would have noticed. I asked him politely why he literally threw the papers at me even if I was flying with Aegean and if that was how he was trained to deal with the public. I also asked him if I needed a manager to check me in. Then after no apology he then checked me in and I was on my way. I go to Greece often and this experience is why I usually try to fly Aegean. The flight itself was a joke. They set up the beverage cart to serve two people (me and one other in front) and then took cart to back to breakdown. But everyone was nice except the ticket agent.

Flew several legs Athens to Heraklion to Rhodes domestic as well as Athens Tirana international. Even on the short haul flights they had some sort of food and beverage service other than the chaotic embarkation process the flight and attendant experiences were very pleasant.

Travelled from Athens-Rome then to Paris and London over a 3 week period. The cabin was clean and staff were attentive polite and well presented. I will travel with them again in the future true value for money.

### Olympic Air customer review
ATH-LCA-ATH on clean and comfortable A320 with plenty of leg room in economy. Efficient crew provided excellent service on both segments of the trip. Sufficient cold meal for this short flight free drinks including wine and beer. Luggage was delivered quickly.

### Olympic Air customer review
2 hour delay going out from Birmingham only to be told when we were up in the air that we would be landing in Greece to refuel and no one could provide us with an explanation. The plane was dirty with rubbish on the floor and in the back of seats chewing gum stuck to the side of the chair. They missed our meals out and we had to point it out staff throughout the flight were chewing which was unprofessional. On the return we were delayed for 15 hrs with no explanation what so ever we were given a 3.50 euro voucher. Instead of returning on 24th we returned on the 25th. We will not be travelling with them again.

Despite the delay departure of 30 mins from Athens to Tirana due to system's break down the flight went smoothly. I was excited onboard DHC-8-400 for the first time. The plane was clean and seems new. The onboard crew were friendly and helpful. The refreshment service for this 1 hr 15 mins flight was rendered efficiently.

Athens to Chania Crete return. A pleasant surprise given previous problems with Olympic airlines. New aircraft A320 both ways clean pleasant friendly staff excellent door-to-door service for my elderly parents on the way to Chania no delays.

### Olympic Air customer review
Athens-Kythira Island (ATH-KIT) on a Bombardier Dash-8-Q400 NextGen. This is a Public Obligation Service route in Greece and the price is reasonable (120 euros return ticket). The flight takes only 30-35 minutes. The cabin interior was clean and modern and the cabin crew very good offering a small snack and bar service to a full load of 78 passengers in such a short flight.

I found a good deal from Athens to Vienna return. I went on Airbus A319 (SX-OAF). The plane was clean the seat pitch good but not as good as the seat pitch of Boeing 737-300/400. The staff were friendly and the menu good. I returned on another A319. Was very full because Austrian Airlines cancelled their flight to Athens. The only problem is that they don't fly to destinations in Europe.

### Olympic Air customer review
ATH-AMS. Check in a breeze friendly ground staff and at the gate. Punctual departure candy given for departure and hot lunch and 2 rounds of drinks offered on this 3h10min flight. Young and friendly staff also showed interest in passengers and cared for flight safety. Flight was only half full but this airline is definitely a good deal nowadays both in price and service. On time arrival and bags showed up soon. They are better value then most competitors. No IFE though in this new A320.

### Olympic Air customer review
ATH-RHO excellent and new A320 aircraft smiley crew and very helpful leather seats excellent service and enough legroom. The flight was on time. Excellent take off and Landing.

### Olympic Air customer review
ATH-CHQ return. Nice new aircraft in both directions ATR-72 and A320 with leather seats and good seat pitch. Check-in fast in Athens onboard service was great and surprised to get a meal on short flight. The only annoying thing - we checked in an hour and 45 minutes ahead in Chania (a bit early I know) and the staff were present but made all of us wait another 20 minutes until they opened the counter. Other than that we had a good experience with Olympic.

### Olympic Air customer review
EFL-ATH-LHR return. Can't fault a thing really good snacks and coffee served on the short hop to Athens a good hot lunch / dinner served by very attentive crew on LHR sectors seating comfortable with more than adequate leg room although some form of entertainment would have been appreciated. Service only slightly marred by being told by a crew member that they would only serve me two white wines as if I was some school child! All flights on time baggage delivery at LHR painfully slow though which needs some attention but not really the airlines fault.

### Olympic Air customer review
AMS-MUC by Lufthansa - my flight AMS-KTM was cancelled due to weather. I was rerouted via Athens by Olympic. My two bags were not accepted by Olympic Air unless I paid 160 euro for the flight to Athens. The fact that Lufthansa had accepted the luggage made no difference. I refused to pay and had to call family to collect one of the bags. At the gate I was told that there was no meal for me. I got the lame excuse that my booking was made at the last minute. Had they told my while checking in I could at least have bought some sandwiches at Schiphol. After arrival in Athens and while checking in it became clear the my luggage was only labelled to Athens despite my request to label it all the way to KTM. My booking was all the way to KTM on one PNR. Filing a complaint with Olympic Air customer service produced a deafening silence. Beware of these amateurs!

### Olympic Air customer review
JTR-ATH on DHC-8. Plane loaded due to ferry cancellations. Very small overhead bins. Enough legroom for a short flight. Service was drink with cookies/sandwich - surprised on such a short flight. FAs quite friendly.

### Olympic Air customer review
Athens-Sofia-Athens. Athens-Sofia an A319 clean and smart cabin. A quite substantial snack was served by all-female cabin crew who were pleasant and efficient. The food was reasonably good. Sofia-Athens leg a Dash 8-Q400 again with an all-female cabin crew friendly and efficient service.

### Olympic Air customer review
LHR-ATH route in Business Class (waste of money) with a nearly full dirty aircraft. Crew members huddling in the galley engaged in conversation that apparently could not be interrupted by offering any semblance of proper passenger service. Heard a lot of hype about the NEW Olympic but in reality was greatly unimpressed. After repeatedly using the call button and being ignored I went to the galley only to find a flight attendant eating from a meal tray and busily stuffing small liquor bottles into her purse. Lavatories not serviced and reeked. Avoid Olympic at all costs.

### Olympic Air customer review
Athens to Santorini on A320. Check in quite good. Used Goldair Lounge at Athens as I got in free with Diners Card. Aircraft interior different to normal OA A320 with dull grey seats. However legroom excellent and service was very good. Much more refined than the old Olympic. Served drink and cookies for the 45min flight. Return on Dash8 aircraft leased from Flybe. OA staff and livery. Small cramped cabin but excellent service with unlimited soft drink and a sandwich/cookie.

### Olympic Air customer review
Economy Class Athens-Corfu-Athens. Service onboard excellent. Both flights in the early morning and cabin crew was very welcoming. The usual choice of beverages was offered along some biscuits filled with vanilla.

### Olympic Air customer review
Rhodes-Athens business class. Staff friendly and attentive with a good standard of English. Food a small salad type meal. On arrival at ATH business pax were provided with a separate bus to the terminal arrival was quick and efficient.

### Olympic Air customer review
IST-ATH and ATH-AMS. Seamless and quick check-in boarding and baggage. Modern clean aircraft (B737 and A320). Meals were great and surprisingly substantial for short flights. Good experience and would fly Olympic again.

### Olympic Air customer review
My daughter (10yrs) flew Paris to Zakynthos through Athens on 18th July with the unaccompanied services. She did tell me about the UM service in Athens - when she got there she was taken to a room with other children to wait 3 hours for the next flight. The staff in the room who was supposed to look after them smoked all the time. This is absolutely shocking to see the way they treat children.

### Olympic Air customer review
Economy Class LHR-ATH-EFL A320 & Dash 8-400. A huge improvement over the old Olympic Airlines. LHR-ATH on a new aircraft more than adequate legroom a decent hot meal served with complimentary beverages. Motivated hard working and smiling crew. ATH-EFL was equally good with a snack and beverages on 45 minute flight.

### Olympic Air customer review
LCA-ATH-LCA flights were on time and enjoy the new look cabin. Food was acceptable with a sandwich and cereal for Breakfast and a Greek salad + roll for dinner on the return. Only annoyance is they changed the return from an A320 to an A319 so my pre-booked exit row seat ended up being just a normal seat and the seat ended up being broken did take me three attempts to get someone to move me.

### Olympic Air customer review
London Gatwick - Athens economy class. A320 everything from staff uniforms to the interior was new. The plane was equipped with PTV screens but no inflight movie or any form of entertainment offered during this 3+ hrs flight. Lollies and newspapers handed out prior to take off inflight hot meal served with wine. Plane arrived early in Athens bags came out a bit late. Overall pleasant trip.

### Olympic Air customer review
Athens-Vienna return on A319. Cabin interior lavatories clean. Seat pitch quite comfortable. Candies and newspapers offered after boarding. Hot meal served and plenty of cold and hot beverages. Cabin crew polite and professional. In-flight magazine was average there was no video/music entertainment available.

### Olympic Air customer review
Heraklion to Athens Athens to Rome. Flights both excellent planes clean (A319 and A320) and flight attendants very professional. ATH-FCO a cold meal was served - in both segments they gave us cookies in the shape of Christmas trees. Complimentary beverages including wine served on ATH-FCO segment and complimentary non-alcoholic beverages on HER-ATH segment. My husband and I were both impressed with the quality on Olympic Air.

### Olympic Air customer review
AMS-ATH return. New Airbus aircraft friendly and polite cabin crew with elegant uniforms. Legroom was great service outstanding sweets before take-off meal service including drink rounds. They are trying hard to provide an excellent service and to my opinion they did.

### Olympic Air customer review
CDG-ATH A320. Welcomed by a friendly crew seats quite comfortable. I was sitting one row behind the emergency exit and the cabin crew came to brief the passengers about the operation of the doors in case of emergency. Started =service with drinks and then a hot meal. After that more drinks as well as coffee or tea along with a box of chocolate cookies. Overall good service smiling crew and good value for money bearing in mind I booked the ticket a few days ago and the plane was nearly full. Still room for improvement though as there is still no in flight entertainment or a good magazine to keep the passengers busy.

### Olympic Air customer review
Delays are pathogenic to Olympic Air. ATH-TIA left with 25 minutes delay. The plane was a Q400 new but uncomfortable and noisy - had a window seat which was not reclining and there was no window shutter. Newspapers were not offered lunch was not offered on a tray but a plastic box with sandwich and a confection. After drinks / coffee they gave us box with cookies. Return with A319 change of equipment was probably because there was still a problem of delays. The aircraft did not have a business class area. We were offered newspapers (in the old way manner left on the galley to be picked up) but this time food offered on a tray - tasteless and indifferent. I could not complain but the service was not remarkable. The hostesses were all girls (there is clearly a problem with men stewards) friendly and more than helpful.

### Olympic Air customer review
LHR-ATH new A320. Aircraft was clean but grey and gloomy. Food surprisingly good good coffee by airline standards. Service excellent. The return flight was another new A320 whose blue seats gave economy class a feeling of being a cut above budget-airline equivalents. Food and service of a high standard although trays could have been cleared away sooner - and the aircraft was rather warm. Check-in for both flights was a breeze. Olympic Air has made a promising start with a new impression of efficiency that will be a revelation to anyone familiar with its predecessor. But London to Athens is a most competitive routes and at the moment Aegean still edges it offering in-flight entertainment where OA had none (a surprising omission) and its own magazine (aside from a one-off souvenir magazine commemorating OA's heritage OA's magazine is in fact that of the parent company MIG beefed up with OA-specific content and is in Greek only). Furthermore the frequent plugging of MIG's other brands was seriously off-putting even it did mean free biscuits promoting its food arm. Hearing "Thank you flying Olympic Air part of Marfin Investment Group" at the end of the flight is a surefire way to drain the glamour out of the Olympic brand name and any remaining romance out of flying altogether. Nobody loves a conglomerate so a bit more subtlety would go a long way. I'll keep my eye on OA in the future but for the time being will probably continue to choose Aegean for this route.
