### "doesn't answer any emails"
Made and paid for the tickets in April. August get notice the time of departure changed. Then a week later notice that the airport has changed. A couple of days before the flight get a notice that the flight is cancelled. No alternate flight, no reason and no telephone response. Got message that my money was returned to EDreams. EDreams never got any money from AirConnect. AirConnect doesn't answer any emails. Filed dispute with bank. Had to book withTarom Air at double the price.
