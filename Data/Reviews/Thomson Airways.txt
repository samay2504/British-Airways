### "stop messing passengers about"
So everyone checked in early, the flight wasn't full. The bus crammed everyone on within an inch of their lives and here lies the problem. On TOM7748 and sat on the tarmac awaiting push back to be told that we have missed our time and have to sit on this plane for 1.5 hrs before an update. Maybe if the bus hadn't waited to cram everyone onboard and instead allowed an acceptable number to get on the bus then these people do not have to then wait by the plane to board. Instead, a steady flow of passengers can board while the bus returns to the terminal to collect the next batch would have been far more efficient. Why oh why do budget airlines get it wrong compared to some of the more established airlines who quite often are responsible for loading twice as many passengers. Almost every holiday I go on, the element of that holiday that consistently fails me is the flight. I feel like I need another holiday afterwards. Come on Thomson and stop messing passengers about, and please do not give any feeble excuses, we have heard them all before many times. Meanwhile, we are all still sat here awaiting the start of our holidays that we all worked hard for to relax and enjoy. But not sat on the tarmac at Birmingham airport.

### "Crammed in like sardines"
Gatwick to Sal (Cape Verde). Crammed in like sardines, not sure how Thomson get away with this. Space between seats is so limited you cannot get out without hanging on to seat in front, so you annoy your fellow passenger. Seats also recline so if you are unfortunate enough to have someone in front recline you are effectively a prisoner in your seat. I am 6’ tall and my knees were touching seat in front in upright position. Extra leg room seats not purchased in advance (very expensive hence availability) were offered for £30 each. These were snapped up quickly but looked like they were taken by “larger” passengers. No entertainment. Food surprisingly tasty, no choice. Crew seemed happy. On arrival Thomas Cook airbus was on tarmac, very jealous! Will not do this route with Thomson again unless they use different plane.

### "We were very pleasantly surprised"
We were very pleasantly surprised with our experience in Premium. We normally fly Premium Economy on British Airways and this was a far better experience – the plane was lovely and new and the crew were much friendlier. The premium experience on board is good, nice to have additional space and a private section of the cabin and the crew were generous with drinks. The food was fine and we were pleased to be served two hot meals on the way out. Our checked bags came off very promptly at both ends the Premium labels did seem to make a difference. The only slight negative was that our flight left Gatwick late afternoon and the Premium check in line took longer than the normal one as they seemed to give priority to those checking in for next morning’s flights. Strange, but didn’t spoil the overall experience.

### "Check-in at Manchester was horrible"
❎ Not Verified |  Manchester to Hurghada. Check-in at Manchester was horrible, line was massive. Our flight was around 1 hour delayed and was not informed about the reason although requested. The flight had no IFE, and therefore was boring. Was instructed by cabin crew to fill in a form for when we arrived in Egypt, no pen was handed out so had to ask other passengers to borrow one, which we thought was not acceptable. Would only fly shorter routes with TUI in the future, unless we were on a Boeing 787.

### "There was literally no leg room"
I have flown with Thomson now Tui before to the Canaries and it has always been okay. The staff are friendly and there was very expensive food and drinks on offer should you want to buy anything. My biggest issue on my latest flight was the size of the seat. There was literally no leg room. I am only 5'5 and my knees were touching the seat in front and they were so narrow they were almost impossible to sit in. When I was told to put my bag under the seat in front it left nowhere for my legs. It was the most uncomfortable four hours of my life - never again.

### "legroom was perfect with plenty of space"
Recently returned from a return trip to Florida with Thomson and as per usual they were fantastic. Aircraft was a 3 month old DreamLiner and it's such a brilliant plane. I'm 6ft and the legroom was perfect with plenty of space unlike years ago when my knees were jammed into the seat infront! Decent choice of movies and a few games to play which kept us occupied as our tablets had to be in hold luggage do to the US Ban. The crew both ways were friendly and attentive, the free drinks were plentiful and it was never an issue getting more if required. The food both ways was fine and wiped the floor with what I've had on our Flag Carrier during the past year. The return flight was the same aircraft as the outbound leg and we landed into Gatwick 1 hour early after a smooth overnight flight. I really can't fault Thomson in anyway, I fly long haul a lot and the larger airlines don't even come close. We are already booked on them again to Barbados in February 2018.

### "didn't enjoy this experience"
Manchester to Larnaca. The flight was initially delayed for an hour because of technical issues but once boarded we were told that the delay would be up to a further 2.5 hours due to inclement weather over Belgium. We eventually left 2h 57 minutes late. Our flight number BY2334 is constantly late. The seats were uncomfortable and the entertainment was poor (although we didn't expect entertainment). Our aircraft was 18 years old and was showing it's age. We didn't enjoy this experience and were feeling quite tired and aching on our arrival.

### "just feels like you are being scammed"
I booked my flight through bravofly to go to Mallorca. I loged on to the website to check in online for the flight about 18 hours before the flight. The check in system was not working. I kept trying throughout the day without any luck. The company stated check-ins are open up to 6 hours before flight. This caused me frustration because I didn't even know If I would be able to board since I couldn't provide my advance passenger information. When I arrived at thw check in I got charged £45 for hand-luggage because the limit is 5kg. I took my laptop in hand and gave them the bag. But really? 5kg? A womans purse weighs more than that. They can at least have the minimum decency to say "no hand luggage allowed so we can milk you the remainder of the ticket price that we removed to appear competitive". I never have checked hand luggage weight and never had a problem and I always pack the same amount of clothes for a 3 day buisness trip. You can always say it is my fault for not checking, but even if I had the limit you are informed of this after buying the ticket, unless you search online, leads one to the only option of buying bag allowance. The just feels like you are being scammed even if they can claim they have no wrongdoing and the customer is blaimed for not checking thoroughly. Just to mention at this point, that it was not my money I was spending, so I couldn't care less about that. It is their attitude that they can pull any trick up their sleeve and get away with it. It does seem to be the case though. What was also interseting was the smirk of the lady that was at the desk as if she was pocketing the money (obviously not the case). The seat I was given was on the aisle so at least I had some leg room. Given that it was an economy flight everything regarding food and entertainment was heavily priced, but that is expected. The flight was delayed by about an hour, plus the time it took me to retrieve my overweight "man-purse" resulted in me being delayed for my pickup that we had arranged with my colleague for another couple of hours. Overall it caused me a 3 hour delay. Communication with the staff was minimal so it was as if they didn't exist. It is by far the worst company I have travelled with.

### "an enjoyable flight"
Gatwick to Puerto Vallarta. We travelled in premium economy both directions and it's worth the upgrade, but only just. Firstly the premium check in was fast, the included lounge access was great. The only part of the upgrade that doesn't work is the bags off first, this didn't happen in both directions. The food quality was acceptable, drinks were free flowing. The crew seemed to be experienced and happy which made for an enjoyable flight both ways.

### "I was sorely disappointed"
Flew Thomson from Birmingham to Cancun. I read a lot of the company's blurb about how good their Boeing 787 was. I was sorely disappointed. My seat and table were filthy, I asked a stewardess for something to clean it with, I was told that they carry nothing to clean with. I said that it wasn't good enough, she agreed telling me that "passengers can be really disgusting! No apology, no solution. Between the seats hadn't been vacuumed for more than 1 previous trip. Incredibly unhygienic. Staff were rude and disinterested. Thomson should be embarrassed by their seating policy that if you don't pay you won't sit next to people in your party.

### "worst flight I've had"
Sal to Gatwick. The worst flight I've had. I already lowered my expectations but nothing could have prepared me for how bad this was, it ruined the end of a great holiday. Check in lady told me to take the souvenir on board rather than check it in as it would be safer, unfortunately when I got on board it didn't fit in the lockers above my seat. Went to the Cabin Manager to ask for some help and the response was "it's not my fault you brought something too big, if you can't find somewhere then you can't take it". Thankfully fellow passengers were helpful in moving bags etc around to help me fit it in. No  vegetarian meal despite ordering one and having the proof. Once again the Cabin Manager said no food was loaded, even for purchase, other than the chicken meal, so no food for me. Decided to just get some sleep, as it was a night flight, unfortunately the crew decided to make announcements all night, chat so loud in the galley I could hear all the intimate details of their conversations. The "extra leg room" seat was the most uncomfortable ever. Virtually nothing to watch on the IFE, compared to the amount available of every other airline I've flown on for a flight of that length. When I complained to Thomson on return, after waiting a month for them to email back it said "we can't please everyone and most customers are happy with our service!

### "this crew made me feel less than safe"
We booked a 7 day package with Thomas Cook flying from Manchester/Dubrovnik return. Our designated airline was Thomson. We had a pleasant and uneventful flight outbound. On time and crew very good. After a lovely week in Croatia, we had an early morning start to the airport for our return flight to Manchester on 21st May. The flight was on time and no dramas boarding. Then it took a downward turn. We were seated in Row 31 near the back of the aircraft. From the moment that the doors closed, we were subjected to an absolute cacophony of noise from two female crew in the galley behind us. This went on over the security video (most of which I couldn't hear) and down the runway to take off. We were hopeful that this would come to an end once in the air, but no such luck. Due to turbulence, and the pilot asking that passengers remained seated, we were treated to a continued running commentary with added shrieks regarding the social media postings of these ladies, their friends and their nights out. I was trying to read my book, feeling very tired, and in need of relaxation. 20 minutes after take off, I gave up and pressed the crew call button. No response. After another 10-15 minutes, my call was clearly noticed amongst the girl's catch up and one of the flight attendants came to my seat. I politely explained that we were quite tired and that their constant noise was disrupting my flight. I was then told (3 times) that this particular attendant and her colleague were "only human" and "like a chat". Silly me, there I was thinking that they were in their workplace and responsible for passenger comfort and safety. When I pressed on and asked if perhaps they could just keep it down, I was told to "please don't say keep it down". There seemed to be absolutely no awareness that several rows of seats in front of the galley could hear every word, and no recognition that their conversation topics might be inappropriate in a supposedly professional setting. Whatever training this crew received regarding their conduct whilst airborne, clearly needs refreshing and soon. The high frequency chat went on throughout the flight. My particular favourite was the comment to a passenger in a seat a couple of rows in front of us which was "we're out of Jack Daniels, although who would want to be drinking JD at this time of day?! Lol. I suspect that anyone, particularly a nervous flier who might have fancied a tot of whisky, had their card well and truly marked right there! Most worrying was the 10-15 minute delay in pressing the call button and the arrival of crew (two rows from the galley). This was put down to the captain's request for seatbelts to be fastened. So what happens if someone has a heart attack during turbulence, which was to be fair, mild? Doesn't bear thinking about. It was crystal clear that for the initial part of this flight (over 40 minutes) the ladies in charge of the rear of this aircraft were paying absolutely no attention to what might be happening in the cabin. (I looked back frequently and they were always facing the back of the aircraft). Frightening in this day and age. I have complained about this to Thomson as this crew made me feel less than safe. Needless to say, no reply has been received to date, hence this post. My next flight in August is with Thomas Cook. They used to be the poor relation to Thomson. I book them ahead of Thomson now if there is a choice.

### "was the best experience"
Santa Clara to Manchester. Travelling back on 30-05-2017 seats 5A/C was the best experience with a stewardess who was fantastic, with great service and always smiling. Our friends who we had been on holiday with told her about our wedding anniversary whilst we were away she put message on screen wrote us a card and a bottle of wine, she then insisted on having photo taken with my husband and his friend. When we told her how great she was she said she was just doing her job which she loved. It made our journey a pleasure and we are still talking about her.

### "service onboard was erratic"
Birmingham to Malaga. Flew with Thomson Airways as part of a holiday package and was really disappointed with the experience. To start with checkin at both destinations was disorganised and there was little or no staff presence managing queues. Flights operated late both ways will little explanation as to why. The service onboard was erratic to say the least the crew were disinterested with passengers and rushed through everything to hide away in the galley. I decided not to purchase any duty free as I didn't fancy flicking through my brochure which was stuck together with gum.

### "amazing staff on our flight"
Tarbes–Lourdes to Manchester. What amazing staff on our flight! We were travelling home from a week in Lourdes with HCPT the pilgrimage trust and were delayed. A sing song started and all of the crew joined in, singing and dancing in the aisles, it was lovely to see! Once we took off nothing was too much trouble! The whole cabin staff team went above and beyond.

### "nothing wrong with economy"
Manchester to Punta Cana. We have flown Thomson on numerous occasions and never really had any complaints. This was our first time on the Boeing 787 and we decided we would give economy a try. Whilst the seats are slightly bigger I wasn't fond of the 3x3x3 formation. We like the Boeing 787 and have booked both Jamaica and Mexico for 2018. That said we have booked premium for both. Personally the upgrade and what comes with is worth the additional cost. That said there is nothing wrong with economy. The staff were kind and polite. I'm not a fan of food served on planes at that's the same for premium. I wouldn't mark the airline down on that though as I am not a fan of the meals served on BA or Virgin either. I would recommend Thomson.

### "would probably fly Thomson again"
This flight with Thomson from Birmingham to Montego Bay was rather disappointing in some parts. However, parts of the flight were good. The flight took off from Birmingham on time (always a good thing). Because it is a long-haul flight they served complimentary drinks and around 3 hours into the flight they served lunch. It was sausage and some sort of mashed potato with veggies. They served it with crackers, cream cheese and unusually jelly beans? Around 2 hours before landing they served afternoon tea. However, landing went well until we got to immigration where there was a large queue but that wasn't the airlines fault. The return flight was delayed with no clear explanation (we made the time up and landed 20 minutes early) however, boarding was quite quick. Once we got airborne the inflight services commenced and shortly after it was meal time. I was served a traditional Sunday dinner which consisted of chicken, potatoes, broccoli and carrots. It came with crackers and cream cheese again plus a Milky Way chocolate bar. Then into the early hours of the morning breakfast was served it was sausage, beans, omelette and a hash brown. It was served with orange juice. Once we landed at Birmingham getting through immigration was very quick. All in all the flight was good and I would probably fly Thomson again.

### "Altogether a good experience"
Just back to Gatwick from Costa Rica and we were impressed by the Boeing 787 and service from Thomson Airways staff, though not by having to pay in order to sit together!. Staff were very attentive on the outgoing flight with similar drinks and food service to scheduled airlines for long haul flights. The meals were slightly smaller but very tasty. Thee seats were comfortable and the cabin was airy. Altogether a good experience and I would definitely fly with Thomson Airways again.

### "do not whatsoever pay for extra space seats"
❎ Unverified |  Flew Thomson from Manchester to Jamaica. Do not whatsoever pay for extra space seats on this aircraft and choose row 30 B C G or H, they are right by the toilets and other passengers use the space in front of you to queue for the toilet or stand and chat. They completely ignore the fact that you have paid for the extra space and sometimes even try to get around 8 people all stood in the space at one time. Nothing done by the stewards or stewardesses to elevate the problem.

### "flight from hell"
Glasgow to Sal, Cape Verde. Flight of 6 hours 20mins in Thomson Airways short haul, narrow bodied aircraft. Paid £200 for extra legroom which we only got at take off and landing. The flight attendants invited people to move about the cabin and this was taken as an invite to stand in front or perform exercises in extra leg room. My feet were continually trampled on. One woman even put her children and their toys in the space while she went and sat in her own seat. The trolley was up and down the cabin constantly flogging drinks. duty free, scratch cards you name it. Banging into the seats as they progressed and causing queues for toilet resulting in people hanging over your seat. Space well and truly invaded. Meal average and coffee with the meal had to be bought. No entertainment. Flight from hell. Complaint to Thomson but as usual they take no responsibility. Tell you everything is wonderful and the surveys are great. Total rubbish as I am in contact with people who also endured this nonsense and have had the same response..

### "much better than we expected"
We recently flew with Thomsons from Stansted to Cancun. It was a long 10 hour flight but surprisingly we found it much better than we expected from a charter flight. Extra legroom going out and Premium on the return. The food was just about edible and as good as British Airways or Virgin. The seating was more spacious than we expected and in Premium as good as the just mentioned airlines. Being mildly claustrophobic I found the Boeing 787 very spacious and airy. The service was attentive and friendly and better than many charter flights we have done. Quite a few of the reviews for this flight are negative but I have to say we thought it was much better than we expected and therefore were not disappointed. For the price (and Stansted is much more convenient for us) we found that it was much better than British Airways and overall 'well done to Thomson! You excelled when it could so easily have been a never again experience!

### "could not get comfortable"
Birmingham to Cancun. We purchased an economy ticket with the extra leg room for £100 per person. We thought that they should have electronic check-in by now but they still rely on their paperwork. A boarding pass on an iPhone would have been simple and easy. The extra leg room seats were towards the rear of the aircraft. The seat did look like it had additional leg room. However, it is the most uncomfortable seat I have sat in, in my life. We had a 10 hour flight ahead of us and we could not get comfortable whatsoever. We could not sit together which I found disappointing. We had to sit behind one another. The toilets are few and far between with only 4 single onboard (for economy use). These were in constant use from the moment the plane took off to the moment we landed. This naturally creates a queue in the isle of people waiting to use the toilet. The food was basic going out to Cancun and coming back it was awful. We couldn't eat it. The entertainment was very basic with a few films being offered to watch. Make sure you take two pinned headphones with you as these weren't provided on our flight. There is no WiFi on the flight but there is a power socket for your iPhone. The flight coming back was only 8 hours because of 'jet streams' however, they made sure we left 1 hour later, so we didn't arrive before schedule. To summarise, a cheap flight where they have maximised profit by 'ramming' it full of paying passengers going on their holidays! Very, very poor. I would not recommend or use Thomson Airways long haul again. They have invested in the Boeing 787 but gone for the cheap options. We will look to use an alternative airline in the future and have just booked Virgin Atlantic for our holiday in Florida in July 2017. You have been warned!

### "can not see us traveling on any more Thomson long haul"
Flew Thomson Airways from Manchester to Phuket. I was really looking forward to my flight, my husband is disabled so we phoned to book the disability seats and were told that these seats have good leg room and are close to toilets. When we got seated we did find the seats had a bit of extra leg room but we still felt very cramped. There does not seem so much space to walk up and down and if the person put their seat all the way back you feel even more cramped. We also were not near a toilet that we could use and my husband had to walk all the way back to the back of the plane because the toilet near us was for people that had upgraded only. The food was not good with only one hot meal that was very small and I was unable to eat, later we were given a ham roll and that was all. I asked if I could buy a bottle of water and a shake but was told they do not sell extra drinks on the flight, but I was given a small cup of water. When they came round with hot drinks, I had a coffee but when I asked for sugar and a spoon I was told they had no more onboard. Both me and my husband are retired and wish to travel but unless I could afford to upgrade my seats I can not see us traveling on any more Thomson long haul so it will be Europe for us, which is a shame because we had a few places we wished to visit, but we not not justify the extra cost.

### "seats with plenty of legroom"
Gatwick to Mauritius on Boeing 787. Sat in seats 11A and B which were excellent with plenty of legroom considering they are classed as standard seats. Crew out were excellent, very attentive and both instances of food served were also very good. Flight was very enjoyable with just the right amount of time spent by the crew doing food and drink, and time allowing passengers to relax and get some sleep. As for the aircraft, very quiet, smooth flight and a decent choice of in flight entertainment. Was surprised at the legroom and the recline on the seats as I never usually sleep on an aircraft but managed a few hours on this one! No complaints!

### "return flight was appalling"
Return Flight from Barbados to Gatwick, depart Barbados Adams Airport at 17.00 on Sun 13/11/2016, flight TOM61, arrive 05.00 on Monday 14/11/2016 London Gatwick Airport (seats 11G and 12G). The return flight from Barbados to Gatwick was appalling. We were in aisle seats, one behind the other. Both seats were directly underneath the overhead ventilation slot for the air conditioning. The slots dripped water onto our heads for two hours without stopping. I complained to a member of the cabin staff and asked to move to another seat. I was told that there were no spare seats and that they would come back to me in a moment. They did not return. Several other passengers, including my partner in the seat in front had to suffer this. I had to sit with a newspaper on my head with drip, drip, drip every 5 seconds for two hours - totally unacceptable. If this is an example of a Dreamliner then Thomson bought the wrong aircraft. At the end of the flight I again complained to a member of the cabin staff and asked to speak to the cabin manager. I was told that the cabin manager was completing her paperwork and I would have to wait. Clearly paperwork was higher priority than customers. I left without speaking to the cabin manager.

### "service in Premium Economy was first rate"
Flew Thomson from London Gatwick to Mauritius. My first time flying in the Boeing Dreamliner and despite initially being sceptical on all the hype about the airy cabin environment I have to say both outbound and inbound flights were the best I have encountered when flying Premium Economy cabin long haul. Being of 6 foot 2 inches in height and weighing 18 stone I found the premium ecomomy seating extremely comfortable (seat 3G both ways) and even got the passenger in front of me to fully recline their seat to see if it impinged on my comfort, it did not. Both flights were punctual, I believe this had a lot to do with the well administered boarding arrangements at both airports. The service in Premium Economy was first rate, the outbound flight having slightly the edge over the inbound one with the food quality seeming to be of a better standard on the flight out. The cabin staff were very frequent visitors with the drinks trolley, especially during the early stage of the journey and this probably contributed to me spending a large portion of the outbound night flight sleeping. I cannot comment on the cabin media as I did not watch any films but my wife says that TUI could do with updating their film offerings. In summary, very comfortable flights with good service. I would definitely fly Thomson Airways Premium Economy cabin on the Boeing Dreamliner again.

### "impressed with the aircraft and staff"
East Midlands to Heraklion with Thomson Airways. We were very impressed with the aircraft and staff on this flight. The plane was very clean and much better than previous flights with Thomson. The aircraft looked almost new and I am sure there was more legroom. The least said the better about the airport when we reached our destination.

### "I was very disappointed"
Manchester to Dalaman return. Flew with Thomson Airways and was very very disappointed with the service and the quality of in flight features. The seats were extremely uncomfortable and old. The interior of the aircraft was filthy on both the outbound and inbound flights. The crew were rude and not welcoming at all. Overall I was very disappointed with Thomson Airways.

### "only use as a last resort"
Manchester to Alicante with Thomson Airways. Extra leg room seat bought. Seat 35G which has the toilet bulkhead in front of you. Probably less actual stretching space than a normal seat. Sat on aircraft not moving for 40 minutes before crew explained the delay. Cabin crew ignored my seat for all 4 types of sales services. Clumsy crew in my area, knocking seats and dropping things. Only use if you get a really cheap deal or as a last resort. I got a cheap last minute seat, so it got me to destination without any frills whatsoever.

### "professional crew"
Overnight flight from Puerto Vallarta to London Gatwick with Thomson. Left on time and arrived very early at Gatwick. Professional crew who dealt well with obnoxious customers. Food and drink was served efficiently. Tasty but small portions. Seats felt more uncomfortable than on the way out as this was a night flight. Attempted to sleep. Did not enjoy IFE as choice very limited indeed. Horrendous queue at check in PV. Unacceptably long.

Did not enjoy IFE as choice very limited indeed. Horrendous queue at check in PVR. Unacceptably long.

### "food alright but inadequate"
London Gatwick to Puerto Vallarta. Check in at Gatwick a total shambles. Massive queue and waited over an hour. Had arrived 3 hours before the flight but at that time thay were only checking in flights for way before ours. Went to get breakfast and by the time we got back, it was horrendous. Clearly not enough staff for the rush of early morning flights. Boarding was more orderly. Having paid for extra legroom, seat was fairly comfortable and the legroom was good, so worth the money. Food was alright but inadequate portions and only one proper meal on a flight of over 11 hours! They come around flogging over priced snacks half way through the flight, plus mosquito bands which I would say were superfluous as we haven't seen a single mozzie the whole time we have been here. Feels like a money making scheme and nothing more, playing on people's zika fears. IFE a hopelessly poor and small selection, so I have pretty much exhausted all the preferred options on the outbound flight. Crew were reasonably ok and quite efficient. Boeing 787 not as amazing as I was led to believe. Perhaps I didn't feel as jetlagged as I thought I would but the proof of the pudding will be the return overnight flight. If an airline like BA ever decide to start this route, they will have to up their game. At the moment, they have the monopoly. Would recommend Thomson but only because the alternative on this route would involve a change in either the USA or Mexico City which would elongate the journey unnecessarily.

### "seat and seat pitch satisfactory"
Stansted to Lanzarote return. Flight both ways departed on time and arrived early. For a 4 hour flight seat and seat pitch were both satisfactory. Staff both ways carried out their duties well. The only complaint is for a 4 hour flight I would expect in flight entertainment - all we had was a flight map which was stopped on both flights far too early.

### "1 service trolly on a 4-hour flight"
Doncaster to Tenerife with Thomson (operated by SmartWings). Do not use them. There wasn't a choice of hot drinks only tea and they didn't have any milk. Only 1 service trolly on a 4-hour flight. No alcoholic drinks or duty free at all. Service was not good. Not much choice of food. When I book a Thomson flight I expect Thomson service.

### "The staff were amazing"
Bournemouth to Lanzarote. Was a pleasant flight going and coming back, apart from 3 drunks who disturbed the flight going. The staff were amazing especially one in particular, who dealt with these drunks well and always had a huge smile on her face even though she got called some inappropriate names.

### "delayed by over an hour"
Flew Thomson from Leeds Bradford to Paphos. Flight was delayed by over an hour due to a problem with the aircraft on it's previous flight, which couldn't be helped. When we were called to board, it took us over another hour before we got moving, and we were left to roast in a cabin with no air conditioning, as the auxiliary engine that enables air conditioning without the main engines being used was faulty. Again, this couldn't be helped, but my problem was with the fact they boarded us despite how the flight was delayed even further, with no explanation. Otherwise the flight went without a hitch, but it took us nearly two hours to finally get off the ground.

### "staff were very pleasant"
Gatwick to Pula with Thomson Airways. Flight was on time and all staff were very pleasant. Travelling as a family of 4 (2 adults and 2 children aged 10 and 12). Did not pay to reserve seats. Don't agree with it - nobody should have to except if your paying for extra leg room etc. This business of not being able to sit groups together was never a problem in the past, planes have not changed so why has it suddenly become a problem over recent years? Outward flight we were sat 3 in one row and other person across the aisle. Return flight we were all sat separately (row 20, 25, 29 and 39). Other people were also sat apart and once all on board the flight attendants did a bit of juggling and without having to ask they approached me and had made 3 seats together so at least I could sit with the children.

### "staff are always very friendly"
Very punctual and smooth flights with Thomson from Salzburg to Manchester. Staff are always very friendly and of assistance. The eatery is of okay value for an airline, although hot drinks at £2.50 is on the steep side. Seats are comfortable enough, but they do not provide much legroom. Everything is clean, and it is always a joy to watch the pre-flight safety video, which I'm glad Thomson haven't changed.

### "very little legroom"
Cancun to Glasgow and would advise anyone to completely avoid Thomson and their "Dreamliner" - it's anything but what dreams are made of. Seats are arranged like cattle, offered drinks for first 2 hours of 9 hour flight and that was it. Seat was damp on way out, raised with crew who could "only apologise". Entertainment choice was very poor. Would recommend Thomas Cook, or United who I've had much better experience flying with. Best thing about Thomson is their pay £15 to choose your seat deal. They endeavour to sit parties together where possible. Given it's a 3x3x3 set up, it's understandable that parties may be split across the aisle from each other as some people have kids etc. Best thing was, they sit you on complete opposite sides of the aircraft, seat C and seat G. Not to worry, upon take off you're given a strict warning not to cross over from one side of aircraft to the other. However pay us £15 each and they magically conjure up seats 13 C and 14 C. In addition, food very poor, just go elsewhere value wise you'll get much better. Seat configuration is so rigid too, with very little legroom.

### "extra leg room not worth the extra"
Gatwick to Cancun return. I don't enjoy flying so my husband booked the extra leg room on the Boeing 787, for this 10 hour flight. Service was good with free drinks, we only had soft drinks and hot food. I settled down to watch a film with the screen some 18" away from my face, perfect. Within an hour or so, the passenger in front reclined their seat! Screen now 12" away and totalally restricted the extra area that we had paid for. Not happy. The other comment that I would make was that when the tray was opened for use, the back of the chair in front (behind the tray), was filthy. It had what looked like splashes of tea all over it. We did report this to the air hostess on the return journey. Generally though, service, food, toilets all good/ acceptable. Cleanliness and extra leg room seats, if passenger reclines their seat, not worth the extra money.

### "suffering abusive behaviour"
Gatwick to Burgas. Was meant to be on a Boeing 787, but our flight had no plane and no crew, and ended up having over a 6 hour delay. To make matters worse we ended up taking off at 1.20am surrounded by a drunken stag party, using bad language in front of children, shouting, jumping on seats, and swinging on the back of seats, throwing food around, at one point even shouting for the children to put parachutes on ready to jump from the plane. Despite this the cabin crew continued to serve them double whiskey and coke in one hand and a beer in the other, topping them up all through the flight. I strongly disagree when their policy clearly states that no one under the influence of alcohol will be allowed to board the plane. Their case was that because the police had escorted this party onto the plane it was not Thomson's responsibility, but why did they continue to supply them drinks? So the rest of us passengers on that flight at 1.20am had to remain unhappy, very tired, unable to sleep and suffering abusive behaviour. I might add that the return flight was better but I have been put off Thomson by their attitude to this event - and the customer services told me this happens on a lot of flights.

### "an acceptable experience"
Arrived at Gatwick to face a tediously slow 45 minute queue to check-in, before proceeding through the well renovated security clearance in North Terminal. Swift boarding, although flight was delayed an hour whilst sat onboard due to an ATC issue which required a rerouting. Frequent updates provided by a friendly Captain. Once underway food and drinks service prompt and although not generous, tasted good. PTVs are good but the fim/tv selection is very poor (c. ten films). Seat pitch good (33") and decent recline, although seats are narrow and can be uncomfortable when you've a large person seated beside you, as I did. On the return flight, smooth boarding by bus, timely departure and landed 45 minutes early. Meal service and duty-free took four hours to be completed, which left less than five hours to sleep before being awoken for a reasonably good English breakfast. All in all, an acceptable experience - you get what you pay for, value for money, and we only opted for Thomson due to the direct flights to Puerto Vallarta to visit friends - preferable to a two-stop option via MAD/MEX.

### "cabin crew were attentive"
Flew with Thomson Airways from Newcastle to Cancun on 09/06/16 and then returned on 23/06/16. Travelled in Economy, had toyed with the idea of booking Premium Club but decided against it. Flight from NCL to CUN was excellent, I had heard a lot about the 'Dreamliner' and thought it was just hype, turns out it really is a great aircraft. The cabin feels more spacious and the air quality much better than any aircraft I've flown on. As for the service, the cabin crew were attentive and had plenty of banter with the the passengers, the food was good and the entertainment system had a decent selection of films and movies to keep you occupied. The bar service was more than adequate, they came round an hour after we took off, served wine with dinner then another bar service later in the flight - you could go to the galley at any time to ask for a drink (on OB and IB flights they did start to run out of bar stock). The return flight was just as good, my partner and I had pre-booked the window and middle seats and ended up having no one sit in the aisle seat. Would most definitely recommend Thomson Airways if this airline is an option on the route you are flying. I flew BA to Orlando last year and this was a far better experience. Only thing I'll comment negatively on is he cleanliness of the planes, my tray table has stains on it and I could see that the whole aircraft could do with a deep clean - sort this out Thomson, you are flying state of the art aircraft that cost millions of pounds, keep them clean.

### "stupid limit on hand luggage"
Stupid 5kg limit on hand luggage. Ridiculous. My mini case weighs 2.5kg empty. Every other airline allow 10kg which should be what Thomson allow. Such a shame as everything else was great flying from Birmingham to Corfu. We paid extra for 20kg hold cases which even full only weighed 17kg so could have done with the extra hand luggage allowance. I did notice they will up grade it to 7kg if you pay! How petty .

### "crew extremely professional yet friendly"
Checked in online and pre paid for seats, bag drop facility a was fairly quick with friendly staff. Security very pleasant and considering how busy the terminal was, quick and painless. Warmly welcomed onboard by the crew. The aircraft had clearly been on a fairly short turnaround as it was grubby looking in places, but spacious and the legroom was better than some leisure carriers (we were sat in row 17). Selection of drinks and snacks very good, including hot sandwiches. 2 drinks/snacks rounds, as well as duty free carried out. Crew were extremely professional yet friendly and chatty - on the 2 hour 50 minute flight, they worked extremely hard yet always with a smile. Landed on time and very quick processing in the small airport at Preveza. Would recommend and use again.

### "real attentive service"
Preveza to London Gatwick with Thomson. We have always talked about memorable flights over the years and a Thomson Airways from Cyprus over 12 years ago always came to mind. However, our return flight from Preveza, Greece has just taken the prize. Flight delayed for approx 1.5 hours and sat in the aircraft awaiting clearance. The pilot kept us honestly informed with a touch of humour so the whole episode was quite relaxed. The cabin crew where brilliant and a credit to the airline. Smartly attired which is becoming a rarity, great humour and real attentive service.

### "the legroom was good"
Flew with Thomson Airways in May from Stansted to Paphos return. The flight was on a Boeing 737-800 with the sky interior and large overhead lockers. The legroom was good for a 4 hour flight and seats were comfortable - I managed to sleep on the return as it was a night flight. The food was good and reasonable priced. The cabin crew were very efficient and friendly, and on the return journey, tried to get their services done quickly so that people could sleep. The plane was clean and we departed on time both journeys. No IFE, although we had a TV overhead with the airshow.

### "No smiles or kind words"
Trip to Jamaica on 21st May from Manchester with Thomson. Boarded on time, but an issue with seating in the economy cabin delayed us on the Tarmac for an hour. Cabin crew were trying to sit a woman next to her child, the passenger was not cooperating and the cabin crew didn't handle it well. When we were finally in the air, all of the crew were obviously not happy with what had happened, and proceeded to take it out on all of us poor passengers. No smiles or kind words, scared to even ask for another drink. The captain was good at keeping us informed though. On the return journey, crew were slightly better but as it was a night flight didn't see them much. Same issue on way back with seating but thankfully we weren't delayed. Inflight entertainment was rubbish to say the least, and 9 hours with nothing good to watch was not fun. Will try another company next time.

### "needed replacing / upgrading"
Flew from Birmingham to Crete and back for half term. I knew the 757 was quite a old plane, but the interior especially the plane on the way back was not only dirty with left over food from the previous flights, inflight magazines all stuck together and the general seat condition needed replacing / upgrading. I don't mind if the plane is old but the interior really needs looking at Thomson. On the positive the flight deck gave updates regularly and the cabin crew were helpful. We are using Thomson again (booked to go again next half term) just because the flight times from BHX at the moment to Crete are good.

### "impressed with speed and efficiency"
First time with Thomson and was very impressed with the speed and efficiency of check in both in Bristol and Naples despite long queues. Knew that food had to be bought so took sandwiches. Expected leg room to be tight but not bad. The main problem was that my husband was on the aisle seat of three, the other two seats being occupied by two enormous ladies. Yes, the extension belt fitted and the armrest was down but the flab came over and under so he really only had part of a seat. Not pleasant. Doesn't seem fair that very obese people have the same luggage allowance but anyone slimmer who is slightly over has to pay an excess. This problem can only get worse when travelling this way. Not the fault of Thomson whose flight left on time both on the outward and return journey.

### "plenty of legroom"
Flew to Jamaica from London Gatwick on Dreamliner on 13/5 in Premium club. Chose seats row 6. Boarded first so time to get settled before take off. Plenty of legroom and no one behind us so could recline without fear of upsetting folk. Served drinks before take off. Meals good but there was not enough of one specific meal so my husband couldn't have his choice. Staff on outbound were fantastic and kept us amused. They certainly had a good rapport with each other. Drinks were always flowing with crew serving miniatures and mixers when you wanted a drink. Inflight entertainment a bit disappointing. I expected more films to choose from in the premium cabin. On this flight economy passengers were permitted to use premium cabin toilets which I thought should not have been allowed. I understand that that we all need to go but premium cabin pay extra for the extra facilities. Both take off and landing very smooth. Before on the return flight we were offered magazines as well as a newspaper but on our return there were no magazines, so this was a little disappointing. Again flight good and seemed to go very quickly. I certainly recommend Thomson and will definitely be travelling with them again in the future.

### "choose Thomson over Ryanair and EasyJet"
Corfu to Birmingham with Thomson Airways. Booked the extra space seats in row 32 which is an exit row giving us plenty of leg room when the flight attendant isn't using the jump seat opposite. Seat width was a bit narrow but okay for a short haul flight. The only issue I had was a strong draft blowing round me which could be felt by the passenger sitting in the aisle seat but not my husband in the window seat. No IFE provided and drinks were a little on the steep side. Crew were very chatty and friendly and there were plenty of updates on arrival times and route information from the flight deck during the flight. Seats were on the thin side and could do with some extra padding but were bearable for a short haul flight. Toilets were clean and well maintained. Would choose Thomson over airlines such as Ryanair and Easyjet anytime.

### "excellent flight experience "
Glasgow to Dalaman return with Thomson Airways. We were in seats with extra space in row 10E/F both ways. These seats had a great amount of legroom. Flights left on time both ways landing about 30 mins early on return to Glasgow. Crew were fantastic and very friendly. Flight deck gave regular updates on the flights. Food and drink onboard was okay, and I didn't mind paying the price. If you are buying duty free on plane would advise buying on outward journey as not a lot left on our return flight. Another excellent flight experience with Thomson.

### "probably end up flying Thomson again"
Gatwick to Las Palmas return, 1 week apart for holiday purposes; myself and my wife. Both ways sat in extra legroom seats by the over-wing emergency doors. Outbound extremely unfriendly cabin crew serving from the front of the plane. Going through the motions as far as announcements as if having passengers on the plane was an inconvenience. Went up (didn't press the call button) to the galley to buy drinks. As the cabin staff was grudgingly serving me drinks the co-pilot came out of the toilet and asked him how it was going to which he replied he was "under attack. We were going on holiday for gods sake, lighten up! Inbound a different aircraft but much nicer crew; mostly the same people, a different cabin manager so a different ethic maybe? On my photo of the galley cart you can see the airline mergers and rebrands that have gone into Thomson over the years. Overall will probably end up flying Thomson again if booking a package holiday.

### "you get what you pay for"
Outbound Thomson Airways flight to Punta Cana good with cabin crew very friendly and efficient. Drinks trolley shortly after take off, then meal service. Standard aircraft food, nothing to write home about but filling. Good entertainment on built in seat back screens. Seats had good legroom but are rather narrow. Just pray you are not sitting beside a larger person. Seat configuration not very good at 3-3-3. This only suits family's of three. Much better to have 2-5-2 or 2-4-3 this gives more flexibility and enables more people to be closer to an aisle. Return flight left a lot to be desired due to the non interested crew who were more interested in talking to each other than serving passengers. Three times I was asked what I would like to drink and each time I responded, but due to inattention and conversation with cabin crew I was literally ignored to death. Drink measures extremely small, I was given a small splash of brandy with loads of ice. Impossible to taste the brandy. They had miniatures of spirits on the trolley but would not serve them. Seats are incredibly thin and uncomfortable. They would make a fortune selling blow up pressure cushions on the flight. Breakfast served shortly before landing was sausage and omelette, which was surprisingly tasty. The Boeing 787 is a fairly comfortable aircraft but is much over hyped. Claimed to be a lot quieter than comparable aircraft. I would dispute this as I have found Airbus A330 to be quieter than this. There may be something in the claimed air quality as I have not suffered from jet lag as much as before. Overall a fairly good flight which could be greatly improved by reminding cabin crew who pays their wages. Flew as part of a package holiday with First Choice. I suppose you get what you pay for.

### "use Thomson for my next trip"
First time long haul from Gatwick to Orlando Sanford with Thomson airways, flew out on G-TUIH in row 36 as we purchased extra space seat, plenty of leg room and seat width was very good. The flight out was excellent, crew friendly and helpful bringing round plenty of complimentary drinks etc. Flight back in row 34 on G-TUIC was the same. Aircraft was boarded ready to go on time both ways but had slight delay due to congestion at Gatwick and again in return due to a cargo issue. The aircraft are clean and in excellent condition inside with a very good choice of entertainment. I didn't buy into all the Boeing 787 hype beforehand but it is a fantastic aircraft to fly, in especially after going long haul on the old 747-400. Will definitely use Thomson for my next trip.

### "crew were businesslike"
Flew Thomson Manchester to Paphos return in April. Flight left on time, leg room slightly limited (I am 5ft 9). Cockpit announcements informative and the crew were businesslike, but friendly enough. I did feel sorry for the two crew members who had to deal with two parents and three children mid way down the cabin. All of the children appeared to be under 5. They began causing havoc in the departure area, and were rather a nightmare throughout the flight. Thankfully, we were 4 rows back. I pitied those immediately behind as there was simply no escape from the constant shouting screaming and general disruption. Fully appreciate that young families are entitled to a holiday as are the rest of us. I have travelled frequently with young children and have always struggled to ensure that they did not disrupt fellow passengers. The parents in this case simply had no control whatsoever over their children, who were unruly and vocal continuously through a 4.5 hour flight. The mother's response to their constant screaming was to shout back! To their credit, the cabin crew did intervene at an early stage even before the aircraft left the ground to ensure that dad, (who apparently planned to sit apart from his partner and the children for the duration of the journey), took charge of one of the children. This didn't make a huge difference but probably slightly eased the journey for those behind. This was basically all that the crew could do, but they did at least intervene and attempt some improvement without causing offence. Flight back a week later was on time, and no complaints. Clear up of the cabin prior to landing could have been a bit more thorough, but not a huge problem. The most tense part of the return journey was nervously scanning the departure lounge hoping that the family from the outbound flight were not joining us on our return leg. They didn't - result!

### "the service was quite good"
East Midlands to Thessaloniki return with Thomson Airways. The aircraft on both outbound and inbound journeys were new and we were sat on rows 4 and 5, respectively. The flights were around 3 hours 15 minutes. The seats don't have a lot of legroom, and it can feel quite cramped, especially with the seat table folded down. The planes were fairly clean, though on the return journey, two toilets ended up being "out of order", which meant a queue at the back of the plane. Though 3 hours isn't the longest flight, the lack of any entertainment is somewhat annoying; watching a map of the plane's location gets boring after the first five minutes. The food onboard is quite expensive, and not to everyone's tastes, but was sufficient enough for me. As ever, the service was quite good (I always find that it's better on the return journey), and the flights were good.

### "crew were pleasant and helpful"
Manchester to Paphos and return on B737-800 with Boeing Sky Interior, creates nice spacious feel to the cabin. Aircraft clean and comfortable on both sectors. Crew were pleasant and helpful and choice of drinks and snacks was good. Im 6'3 and found the leg room absolutely fine for a 4hr ish flight(30D out 19C back). Found it much more comfortable than the 757 I flew on in January. All in all a good experience with Thomson.

### "worst part was air quality"
London Gatwick to Cancun return with Thomson Airways, and both ways in seats 1A/1C - bulkhead seats with extra leg room. They were the most uncomfortable seats we have ever used in any aircraft with any airline. The recline was abysmal and the seats were really hard and narrow. Leg room was extra, but the so-called leg rests were useless - didn't support your legs at all. Hadn't realised that people would be queuing for the toilet up front right by our seats - got banged and nudged many times. The fold-away tv screens were OK but could have been a bit bigger - and more flexible in positioning. The hot food was awful. I had a fillet steak on the way out - really did think it was liver from its texture and colour, and its lack of taste. The hot breakfast on return was some sort of egg - (omelette?) with a sad looking limp under-cooked sausage - couldn't eat it. Stewards out and back were smart, polite, and attentive, and tried their best. The worst part of both flights was the air quality. Everyone was coughing, sneezing and spluttering about 6 hours into the 11 hour flight out, and the same back. It took about 5 days after to recover. There is something radically wrong with this plane's system.

### "seats were incredibly uncomfortable"
Flew Birmingham to Paphos with Thomson Airways. Boarding was carried out quickly and efficiently. Once on board we found our seats, extra legrom seats which we had paid extra for. The plane looked old and tired inside. The seats themselves were incredibly uncomfortable. There seemed to be almost no paddind on the back rest which made it a very uncomfortable journey. The other problem I encountered was the noise from the engines onboard, it was without doubt the loudest cabin I have been in for years.

### "others given the seats for free"
Manchester to Punta Cana with Thomson Airways on the Boeing 787. Premium Economy was super, although they gave everyone the wrong menu so the food they offered was not available. There was not availability in Premium Economy on the way back so we had to go economy with extra legroom. The room was okay for me because I am only 5'1" but even with the leg room my husband struggled. Plus we paid extra for these seats and other people around us and in the exit row seats were given the seats for free (surely people who have already upgraded should be given these options before the people who have not upgraded. Food was OK as were drinks.

### "a satisfying journey with Thomson"
Gatwick to Montego Bay return, and a satisfying journey with Thomson Airways. Aircraft on the way to MBJ was very clean and modern. Staff are very kind and helpful when you need them to be. Only negative aspect is the in-flight entertainment is very poor with only a handful of movies. Food is okay just like any airline meal. Handling in MBJ is very slow to get through immigration. On the return leg a different plane as it was less modern but still comfortable but hard to get to sleep. Plane was delayed due to tropical rainstorm at MBJ with nothing to do but it was not Thomson's fault you can't help the weather. On the way back there was in-flight entertainment but no headphones so had to ask for them! Ground handling in LGW was okay. Altogether not a bad experience with Thomson.

### "seats are very narrow"
Flight was fine both ways from Manchester to Montego Bay and Thomson have now started allowing passengers to get extra drinks from the back of the plane. When the free drinks in economy were first brought in we were left thirsty for most of the flight. Could Thomson please fix the toilet seat in the toilet in front of seat 30c. The seat kept falling down and this was also broken when we flew in December and has been mentioned on here before. Seats are very narrow. We booked row 10 extra space seats. I am only small and found it quite narrow. There was a woman standing for most of the flight as she was too squashed in her seat as I think she was next to 2 large people.

### "treated with disdain and ignored"
Thomson Airways from Birmingham to Sal Cape Verde, and absolutely awful, flight arrived over 7 hours late due to a power fault at airport (3 hours), and then having to return after 1 hour of flight due to one of three radios having a fault. Then kept waiting on plane and standing on a bus while they decided what to do. Through the entire delay no offer of a drink or food. Total lack of care or interest in passengers comfort and well being, felt really sorry for the families and children. On return complaint is treated with disdain and ignored. If you have a choice of another airline go with them.

### "would fly with them again"
London Gatwick to Montego Bay. I normally fly with Virgin Atlantic to Jamaica but decided to try Thomson Airways as price is much cheaper. The plane was excellent for leg room. Food is very poor and could not eat it. I made sure I brought my own food on the way back home. Inflight entertainment was poor too. Complimentary drinks throughout the flight. Overall the flight was not too bad and I would fly with them again, due to the fact that they are much cheaper than Virgin and BA - I guess you get what you pay for.

### "worst seat possible"
Thomson Airways Boeing 787, and the worst seat possible to have is 27C next to toilet. Might as well have sat in the toilet. Ever time passengers went to visit the toilet I was nudged with no room to get past. This seat should be removed as very unsuitable. Flying for 10hours in a very cold cabin, air con dripping above and crew using tissues to try to stop the water dripping onto passengers. Very disappointed with this aircraft.

### "extra leg room a waste of money"
Manchester to Cancun with Thomson - we had paid for extra leg room which I felt was a waste of money as the seat is not as wide and felt uncomfortable in the middle seat. There was no foot rest which would have made the 10 hour flight slightly more comfortable. The entertainment was good but not what I was expecting. Food was nothing different to what I've had on previous flights. Staff were far from helpful on the outbound flight. Toilets are more spacious than other aircraft. On the whole the Dreamliner is overated in my experience and was disappointed. Slighty better on the way back as managed to get an aisle seat which was spare but meant sitting apart from my husband. Snacks very expensive compared to other airlines but complimentary drinks are available throughout the flight. All in all I've travelled on better and more comfortable airlines. I found flying with Airtours 14 years ago to Cancun was a more comfortable and enjoyable experience then the Dreamliner.

### "staff cheerful and chatty"
I wanted to give credit to the Thomson Airways staff and service we received on our trip from Gatwick to Cancun return on a Boeing 787. Flights were wonderful, we flew Premium and were treated exceptionally well by staff from check in to cabin crew. The seats were comfortable, food great, drinks flowed, all the other little touches, newspaper, water, snacks, hot towels, pillows etc made the long flights much more enjoyable. The staff were cheerful and chatty and the in flight entertainment had something for everyone.

### "legroom was extremely tight"
Recently flew Thomson as part of a package from Manchester to Las Palmas and must say the flight was the most uncomfortable I have been on. The plane looked lovely from the outside but was filthy and visibly old inside with bits of trim missing along with tears in seats etc. The legroom was extremely tight, must worse than say Thomas Cook and Ryanair. Crew where there to sell, sell, sell having made 6 announcements each lasting 4-6 minutes of hard selling and 'special' one time offers that were also available on the way home but has a different offer. Airline also charges credit card fee for onboard purchases so if you are planning on purchasing items onboard instead of at the airport, you would need to factor this in.

### "kindness and consideration"
Tenerife South to Birmingham with Thomson Airways. The aisle seat in the row in which my wife were sitting was occupied by an elderly disabled lady. My reason for writing the review is the kindness and consideration shown by the cabin staff, who were very friendly to this lady.

### "simply not good enough"
Just got back from Dominican Republic, flew there and back Thomson Airways Boeing 787. The flight out was okay, the flight back not so. The food was poor and none of the tv's worked on our side of the plane so we spent eight hours staring at the back of seat. The cabin staff assured us that we would recieve GBP29 each within the next two weeks for the inconvenience. Twenty pounds or not this is simply not good enough for such a modern plane.

### "certainly be using again"
We travelled Thomson Airways premium economy from Manchester to Puerta Plata. We had fast track security and lounge at Manchester included in the package, both worked very well for us and made our pre flight a lot easier. We had fantastic cabin crew on our outbound flight. My husband and I take around 8 flights a year and they were the best crew we have had, who couldn't do enough for us. The return crew were great too. Food was great and drinks plentiful - my only criticism would be the film choice wasn't the best I've had. The Boeing 787 made a massive difference with better air, lighting and noise reduction, my husband was a big fan and said he really felt the difference after the flight. Will certainly be using again.

### "very helpful and polite"
Bournemouth to Las Palmas as part of a package holiday. Online check-in was very easy and quick and on arrival we dropped our bags. Boarding was a few rows at a time which was a good idea as it wasn't a scramble trying to get on. We were greeted on the aircraft by the crew and pointed in the direction of our seats. Directly after takeoff the crew introduced themselves and the service for the flight. I ordered a hot toasted sandwich which tasted very good. Staff were very helpful and polite. Seats were comfortable and legroom good for a charter airline. Thomson advertise their 'iPad enabled crew' and how wonderful it is but we only saw the iPads when they were taking hot food orders and where has the entertainment gone? Thomson is a family holiday airline and they only show a moving map and flight info on the drop down screens - we've always known Thomson to show films and TV shows on these screens but for some reason they have stopped?

### "crew very varied"
Flew with Thomson purely because I had to as it was part of the holiday package from Birmingham to Tenerife, would not select them out of choice. Aircraft dirty both ways, tray tables especially poor with food residue from previous flights. Crew very varied some very pleasant and smart but others look very miserable, scruffy and unkept. One crew member thought it was funny to make faces behind an elderly passengers back because they didn't know where to store their baggage, so childish and unprofessional. Inflight service painfully slow both ways and crew only started serving drinks an hour into the flight. Make sure you take your own food as there is only over priced rubbish to buy which looked greasy and rubbery on my neighbours tray table. Whole flight seem very disorganised compared to Easyjet or Jet2, Thomson crew seem very disorganised and just want to rush everything to hide away in the galley. They only seem to have a passion for shutting the curtain so they can't see their passengers. One toilet in the forward of the plane was sealed off for "crew use only" never seen this before and caused long queues. Would personally avoid Thomson in the future as the flights are more of an ordeal than an experience. Thomson resort staff are wonderful however polite and efficient. Wherever possible would prefer to use Easyjet as they are always consistent and the crew are always polite, smart and organised. Avoid Thomson and don't forget your anti bacterial gel as the planes are filthy.

### "recommend the airline"
We flew with Thomson from Manchester to Reus (Salou) in October 2015. Check in was quick and smooth. Security at Manchester Airport was very busy considering it was about 4am. When I found out that it was a B757-200 I was not impressed. Boarding was very unimpressive and needs to be taken care of. Aircraft was full on the way out, legroom was dreadful. Seats weren't too bad, a bit uncomfortable. Staff were probably the best thing about the flights. Return flight: Check in at Reus Airport was the exact opposite of Manchester while the security issue was the same. Took us about 90 mins to get through check in and security. The aircraft was slightly more comfortable and less noisy. The seat looked a bit newer and the legroom felt as if it was better. Very quick arrival at Manchester and into arrivals within 10 minutes. They even let me have a cockpit visit at the end of our return flight. Despite all of the bad stuff I would still recommend the airline.

### "with lots of leg room"
Thomson Airways from Gatwick to Goa. The priority check in at Gatwick was as fine and lounge was good too. My seat 4D was fine with lots of leg room and the seat reclined enough for me. There was a footrest on the seat in front and, although it was small, I managed to use it when I took my shoes off. The pilot was friendly and efficient as were the crew. The meal was as good as any I have had, including Emirates. There were plenty of free drinks, but Champagne was GBP24 pounds a bottle. The big difference with the Boeing 787 is that the cabin pressure is lower making it a more comfortable flight.

### "no problems flying again"
Manchester to Punta Cana with Thomson Airways. We had a good outbound flight and the return was overall very good. A couple of minor irritations, no seat back film guide and a curt response when asked where they were: "on the screen" - would not have been a problem except that we had one on the way to the Dominican Republic? Seat pocket had not been emptied, I was treated to the magazines of the previous occupant had they been to my taste, I would say some issues with the cleaning at the Punta Cana end. The seats are average and not great if you are a small person. Service was good, drinks then meals but the food was mediocre and the breakfast terrible, no different to other charter flights, I have come to expect nothing better. Despite paying a fair amount for Premium, it's hard to see what you get apart from more leg room and first onto/off the aircraft. The food and drinks are the same and you still get cheap plastic glasses for your drinks. TV screens are good definition but the film choice is limited and no recent releases. First time on a Boeing 787 and apart from it being slightly quieter, I could not tell any difference from any other plane. I would have no problems flying Thomson again but the hype around the Boeing 787 does not transfer to the experience in my opinion.

### "quite impressed for charter"
Cardiff to Las Palmas, and can't really fault Thomson Airways on this trip. Nice clean aircraft, very pleasant crew. Paid extra for emergency exit extra leg room seats but on boarding the legroom on the normal seats seemed fine. Only downside was no inflight entertainment - I appreciate the flight is only 4 hours but they could have shown something. Food okay but pricey. I would fly with them again with no second thoughts, quite impressed for a charter flight. On time both ways - excellent.

### "seat pitch is very good"
We travelled on the Dreamliner to Cancun and Birmingham with Thomson Airways. The seat pitch is very good in economy with a 3-3-3 configuration and although the overhead luggage are very spacious and plentiful, you have to be careful that nobody is standing underneath them when you open them, or else you will hit them. There are not enough toilets in economy class with only 4 between over 200 passengers resulting in constant queues, a major headache for people sitting near them especially the extra leg room seats. When we took off, the air conditioning vents that run along the side of the cabins, started to drip. The cabin staff were handing out paper towels to stuff on the vents and on looking along the cabin there were a lot up there already, so obviously a major problem. Inflight entertainment was ok but not very new films offered.

### "what a crush"
Just returned from Thomson Airways return flight from Manchester to Barbados on the Dreamliner. On first impressions on flight out plane looked good. My husband and I chose centre row aisle and middle seat, thinking we could then get in and out without disturbing anyone. There may be more leg room but not wide enough. Neither of us are big people, what a crush. Very disappointed. Service and food as expected on a plane. Toilets dreadful. There may be more room in cubicle but certainly not enough of them for the amount of people. The one I had to use had a lid that would not stay up and dropped onto my back and the toilet automatically flushed whilst I was attempting to use it. This was both unhygenic and very difficult to use. To get to the other toilet you had to pass through the stewards kitchen/rest area at the back of the plane which was curtained off. When I asked if the toilet was out of order I was told "no". There was an obvious problem with that toilet for at least two weeks because it was the same on the way out and return flight. It's a plane for long haul flights they should have more toilets and offer free water to drink. They also ran out of coffee, tea and drinking chocolate on the first drinks run. Would only recommend this plane if they made a few improvements.

### "forget all the hype"
Cancun to Manchester on Thomson Airways B787 Dreamliner - this aircraft should have been called the sardineliner. Forget all the hype - they still shoe horn you in your seat and slap a nice review of how much legroom you've got. On takeoff, in the window seats water drips down from a corrugated air channel above your head and you can actually see were people have stuffed paper towels into the vents. As for the mood lighting and bigger dimming windows I don't understand the hype. Inflight entertainment and free drinks but Thomson pale into insignificance compared to Virgin - I hope I never have to fly on sardinliner ever again.

### "I would recommend it"
Birmingham to Bridgetown with Thomson Airways. Journey out very good. Comfortable seats, we were in the 3rd row. Drinks were offered often, and lunch and tea were fine. Cabin staff were attentive and cheerful. Films etc were fine and flight went smoothly and was on time. Journey back was not the same. The cabin staff were ok but very scruffy uniform appearance. There was spilt water or condensation on galley floor and no staff effort to mop it up. The dinner meal was good but breakfast possibly the worst I have had, with undercooked bacon and sausage. I found the B787 pressurisation makes a difference and the mood lighting is good. The cabin is light, tall, and airy. Overall I would recommend it but some cabin crew need extra customer care training and pride in the job.

### "disappointed with Boeing 787"
Gatwick to Montego Bay. I was looking forward to flying on this Boeing 787 but was disappointed. Seats in economy are good until the person in front puts their seat back, forcing you to put yours back causing a domino effect all the way back. Thomson advertise free inflight drinks but we only had 2 on a 10 hour flight, and couldn't even buy them unless you buy a bottle of champagne.

### "entertainment the poorest selection"
Our Thomson Airways return flight from Mauritius was not good, firstly the staff did not appear to care, the food was thrown onto our tables, the breakfast was rubbery scrambled egg, the next meal got even worse 6 hours later - Chicken with potatoes and veg, and the food was overcooked. The entertainment was the poorest selection of programmes I have ever had - the music channels were even worse. 12 hours in very cramped seats was no joke, No water offered, you have to scramble by everyone and go to the back of the aircraft in order to get a drink. The Boeing 787 has been totally spoilt by Thomsons, every space possible has been crammed with seats, the aisles are narrow, the walking areas restricted, short on toilets and staff.

### "crew were truly grumpy"
This was our third time out to Cancun and the second time on the Boeing 787. I think I have flown more than enough with other airlines to realise that by now, the 787 is hyped up somewhat; to me, it is just another aircraft. We flew Thomson Airways Premium Economy both sectors and it truly was a journey of two halves. Outbound, about 50 mins late getting into the air as the aircraft still had to be re-fuelled. Once airborne, we settled into the flight and no complaints at all. The crew were great, food edible, plenty to drink and we made up most of the time lost. I think it put most people in that 'our holiday has started here' mood, which was how holiday flights used to be. Coming home was a completely different affair. On checking in at Cancun, we were given a piece of paper from Thomson stating that the incoming flight originated in Sweden and therefore, no duty free or bar services will be offered. Very sorry and all that. We were 90 minutes late getting into the air and the crew were truly grumpy. When this happens, the passengers tend to react quite badly too. If I recall correctly, only one drinks service, no soft drinks offered with the main meal which was not the best airline meal I have ever tasted. And that was about that until breakfast was served about 90 mins before landing in Manchester. On the plus side, we had quite a tail wind behind us and we landed almost on time but we had to be bussed to the terminal. I am not too sure that Premium Economy is always value for money; leg room good but seats still too narrow. I'll rate the journey as 5/10 for the outward leg and 2/10 for the return. Quilts are offered on night flights, I have seen thicker nappies!

### "was a good flight"
Flew Thomson Airways from Stockholm to Cancun this christmas with my family. The airplane was clean and felt fresh. Boarding was swift and without delays. The seats were nice, as far as economy seats go. After take off, the cabin service started and progressed at a decent pace. The dinner was really good and the personal in-flight entertainment systems was great. The flight was quite full so it was fairly loud but nothing out of the ordinary. FA's did their work well. Only real negative was the poor breakfast that was offered, sort of a pasta salad that really wasn't something I'd like for breakfast. All in all, it was a good flight. For an economy ticket, there was a surprisingly large amount of included stuff. I would fly Thomson again.

### "787 details are mostly gimmicks"
Gatwick to Barbados with Thomson Airways. We travelled out in premium economy on the Boeing 787, where service was good and food surprisingly good and plenty of drinks. Seats quite comfortable but in recline with no seat tilt means you tend to slide a lot. On return in economy and what a difference! Leg room good, but seat narrow and not comfortable. Fortunately person next to me was quite small, hate to think what it would be like with some one large! Why do airlines persist with the 3-3-3 configuration. I know they want to cram as many as they can in, but surely with a bit of thought they could be really inovative and try 2-4-3, same number but would satisfy more grouping of passengers. Food ok but pay for drinks even water. The supposed revolutionary details of this plane are mostly gimmicks - the dimming windows (overruled by crew) are nothing more, the overhead luggage is unusually low so watch your head. The larger windows are hardly noticeable, and unless someone told you they were larger I am sure you would not know. The air may be cleaner but I was not particularly aware. Certainly still get jet lag. So all things considered its just another plane. At leasts its new so not in too bad condition. One final point not enough toilets in economy, never seen such a long queue!

### "service was not bad"
Flight out on Thomson Airways from London to Jamaica was OK despite being delayed on the aircraft for an hour by a passenger who was throwing a strop because he wanted a window seat. Service was not bad, free drink and wine with the usual standard meal. Unfortunately on the way back, despite having paid for a seat, my partner had to move due to the excessively large person sitting next to her taking up most of her seat as well as his own. Airlines really need to address this growing problem, if you are too big to fit in one seat, pay for two.

### "worth it for the seat"
I was in row 1 both ways and they are great seats with plenty of legroom and no one in front to recline on you. Staff on outward flight 19/11/15 were friendly and professional, the lead stewardess asking if everything been ok. Shame the return attendants not the same. I know it's a night flight but all they seemed bothered about was to rush through all service and close curtains and sit and talk for hours. When required they pushed through curtains without taking much care that they caught me as I was in row 1  and waking me up. Also on return the benefit of being allowed off before economy class was just ignored - they just let everyone rush off together, a bit annoying as that is what you pay for. Thought food was basic but filled a gap. There is obviously problem with Thomson and staff at Cancun as we were delayed an hour just waiting for buses to take us to aircraft and on landing in Cancun were were ahead of schedule by 45 mins, but had to sit on runway. From overhearing Thomson staff this appears to be a regular problem with Thomson flights and Cancun ground staff. Premuim economy worth it for the seat and fast security at Manchester. given £15 voucher for Manchester instead of lounge which suited me and had lovely breakfast on main concourse. Premium economy was life saver at Cancun as only waited in short queue to book in, whereas economy flights there were three Thomson flights to UK at the same time, and all in one long and winding queue and took hours to book in.

### "not mind flying Thomson again"
I'm not a huge fan of flying, especially long haul. Our flight was to join a cruise ship in Barbados and we flew Thomson Airways for both outward and return. Reading some of the reviews on here before we left, I was looking forward to the flight even less as they seemed pretty bad. I have to say that my concerns were unfounded. Check in at Gatwick was swift and professional, as was our return flight to the UK. Crew were fine and friendly on both flights - we had a delay going out but they engaged with us during that time, and in flight service was no different to what I've experienced with Virgin or American Airlines - well actually, American were worse. Food was as good as any airline food I've eaten - not exceptional, but cured the hunger for a while. I don't doubt that some have had an experience with Thomson that didn't live up to their expectations, but wonder sometimes when I read reviews whether they are over critical. I can only base mine on what we experienced, and would not mind flying with Thomson again. My son flew British Airways last year, and felt that Thomson were streets ahead of the experience he had with BA, yet others I know really praise BA, so I guess it's true that you can't please all the people all the time.

### "crew were fairly efficient"
The product is pretty good, quality of food excellent, drinks were good. The crew were fairly efficient but lacked any warmth. Overall it was ok, but most of the crew were unapproachable and gave the impression that you were inconveniencing them when visiting the galley to ask for anything. Not what you expect in a Premium cabin. The inflight entertainment was ok but the movie selection was quite limited and the only music was a couple of preset playlists that you couldn't skip through. There are no control handsets so everything is controlled from the touch screen, which even when the seat is in the upright position means you have to stretch your arm to reach, you have to lean forward when reclined. introduction of the 787 was supposed to eradicate things like the rude awakening for breakfast before landing that previous aircraft did, where the cabin lights are either on or off, we still got that awakening when the crew just switched the lights straight onto full brightness, rather than gradual brightening that on most new aircraft. I think that Thomson's Premium product has a way to go to match up the mainline operators they compete with, it doesn't just end at operating shiny new aircraft.

### "a good economy experience"
I could not fault the service on Thomson Airways flight from Manchester to Punta Cana. The cabin crew worked the whole time, food was good, plenty to drink and inflight entertainment is good. I also think the claim of better air quality on the 787 has some credibility. I felt better on arrival on both outbound and return flights than I have before. The only gripe is that whilst there is plenty of leg room, this appears to be at the expense of seat width. I am not a large person but I found the seats too narrow and I was pleased that I was not stuck in a middle seat. Also, on the return night flight in seat 17J I didn't like the way the windows were automatically blacked out for the whole flight except take off and landing (and couldn't be adjusted). I take some comfort from being able to see the wing and lights outside. Overall, a good economy experience. I have never had a bad flight with Thomson and will fly with them again.

### "the headrest fell off"
Flew to Mexico for a 2 week holiday/wedding. I was in seat 34B, and after about 30mins into the flight the headrest fell off. Stewards were unable to fix it so for 9hrs my head was resting on a metal plate. No alternative seat or gesture of good will was offered. Return flight and again in seat 34B the headrest fell off. So after 14 days no repair had been carried out? Again no headrest, this is a night flight with no headrest. Complained to Thomsons on my return and they  refused any form of compensation for my uncomfortable 9hr flights. This this is the modern and comfortable Boeing 787. For other customers who encounter this, Thomsons say just accept it as the seats are not part of the safety of the aircraft.

### "service was disgusting"
Bristol to Alicante return with Thomson Airways. We were the first in the queue at Bristol yet when the check in opened there were people getting checked in before us, the person who was checking in our queue took ages to open and no one would let us go to the other check ins. When we finally got seen to we couldn't get seats together, we were told it was because people had checked in online. I tried to check in online before we left but was unable to. When we got to Alicante we had to queue to get off the plane and go through passport control, we were in a room with hundreds of people which was boiling hot with no air conditioning on, it was utter chaos. On our return flight we queued again in chaos and the Thomson reps were moving people from the queue next us and getting them checked in meanwhile ours didn't move, so once again loads of people who were behind us in the queue were getting checked in before us. By the time we finally got checked in I couldn't even sit with my husband - he was 2 rows back from me, and my parents were right at the back, my mum is a nervous flyer and she had to sit on her own, she was terrified. The cabin crew were rude and obnoxious, she talked to me like I was a child. The service was disgusting and I will never use Thomson again, I have traveled for years and have never had to sit away from my husband or have never witnessed chaos like it before.

### "staff polite and professional"
Birmingham to Dalaman return with Thomson Airways. The staff were polite and professional. There wasn't a good amount of legroom for a 4 hour flight, and the Boeing 757-200 aircraft seemed dated. However, overall it was a great flight.

### "feel conned and cheated"
Manchester to Larnaca return. My complaint is that I changed my holiday plans to a more expensive one after Thomson Airways told me I would fly on the Boeing 787. When we boarded the Aircraft on both legs it was a very uncomfortable Boeing 767. I feel conned and cheated, why do Thomson treat their customers with such contempt. Lots of passengers were very angry about this.

### "service was excellent"
From priority check and security to the Skye Lounge was fast and efficient. Priority boarding and welcome aboard from cabin crew, sparkling wine and newspaper to good seating. The service was excellent throughout, the crew were attentive and busy. Given menu for lunch, very good choices, well presented and delicious, refereshments served at intervals during flight. High tea just before landing, again no complaints. The audio system was good but could have had more choice in the films. Fourteen days later on return flight the same experience was had with another good cabin crew who looked after us well. I must say Virgin Premium Economy was our normal choice, first time direct from Glasgow with Thomson Airways Premium Economy but will certainly be using them again in May 2016.

### "same grumpy staff"
We have gone to orlando every October for the last 10 years and started with First Choice Airways (premium cabin), then when the two companies merged it was Thomson Airways but can anyone please explain what has happened to the whole service that we now get? Since the launch of the Dreamliner we have flown out on this wonderful aircraft for the past 3 years but this year it was awful. We booked and paid for this years flights in July 2014 and it was horrendous. At Manchester we had to be taken on a bus to the aircraft then climb the almighty wobbly steps onto the plane, for anyone of limited mobility it was very dangerous. Once on board the miserable cabin crew need to take a course in customer service, they were so grumpy, they shouldn't be doing the job. Please remember we are going to Orlando, families are excited about going to Disney. Menus were flung towards us with the comment its beef or chicken and you may not get the choice you order. Flight back was worse same grumpy staff, awful food, dirty seats, and the fact we had water dripping on us for the whole journey back. Not sure what has happened to this company but we will never use them again as we paid £2,000 for miserable crew, inedible food, dirty seats, dripping water and not to forget the toilets out of action. Our hard earned money is now going to British Airways or Virgin Atlantic.

### "seats are so uncomfortable"
We do not have a choice but to fly with Thomson Airways as the hotel we go to is a First choice and you can book direct through Thomson. The cabin floor of our aircraft was dirty, the back of the seats were covered in splatter marks, I assume food, the metalwork of the seats (armrest etc) had a thick coating of dust. The seats are so uncomfortable and narrow also the leg room is poor. For a 5 hour 30 min flight there is no entertainment yet 6 hours is classed as long haul and you get the entertainment. The food on the inbound flight was almost gone as was the duty free. All the other UK airlines seem to use these small type aircraft for this destination. Thomson look at your reviews and give the paying customers a decent flight.

### "hardly any food left "
Thomson Airways flight from UK to Crete. Had to queue for over an hour and half just to get through to passport control, even though it was supposed to be drop and go. Because we were in the middle of the plane, (extra leg room) when the food came there was hardly anything left - they even ran out of ice cubes, what a joke. This airline cannot even cater for people on a flight of just over 4 hours, how would they cope on a long haul flight. The return flight, if anything was worse.

### "delay excuses are pathetic"
The Thomson Airways flight out was initially delayed for over an hour due to no crew - how does this even happen? Once boarded the flight was again delayed as one of the passengers had drunk too much while waiting for the crew and taken a sleeping pill causing them to collapse en route to the aircraft resulting in another 1 hour delay while their bags were removed. 10 days later arrived at Malaga for the flight home. No delays on the board except one - the Thomson flight to Manchester with a 2 Hour delay. Apparently this was due to our pilot on the outbound flight noticing some fuel on the wing causing an outbound delay while they "deplaned" and brought up a replacement. Thomson Airways - you are a joke and delay excuses are pathetic.

### "seats far to narrow"
Flew Thomson Airways from Newcastle to Sanford Orlando everthing was fine, nice enough plane was on time. We had extra leg room which was more than ample, food was very nice. The plane looked scruffy including the toilets in need of a good scrub, the seats far to narrow. Return bag drop a disgrace in Sanford, it felt like they didnt care that people were tired and just wanted to get into the airport. Flight home was ok but uncomfortable with back again, I'm only 5ft 2 and 8 stone, but the seats too narrow especially when large guy next to you. Food again nice, plane scruffy. Still jet lagged so pretty lights maybe a placebo affect and work for some. Inflight entertainment rubbish and very limited.

### "unable to sit with my husband"
Dalaman to Gatwick with Thomson Airways. Economy is always cramped, that cannot really be helped. The plane was full up and I was unable to sit with my husband even though he is disabled and I am his official carer, we were told we should have checked in online. As my tablet was not working and we had no resort rep assistance I was not able to do so. This was very disappointing, and quite difficult for my husband.

### "drinks service very poor"
We booked extra leg room seats for these Thomson Airways flights. We did have plenty of leg room, but the seats are not that wide and you are squeezed in. Every time another passenger or the cabin crew comes past they bang your arm because it's only just wide enough for a trolley. Drinks service is very poor, they come round twice in 9 hours. Food is the worst ever. The trays and surrounding areas are very dirty - I had to ask for a cloth. Also the toilets are not very clean, particularly the underside of the seat. The available entertainment was good and although the touch screen tv is good, it's not so good when the person behind is playing a game and constantly tapping the screen. It's very annoying. We would not rush to fly Thomson Airways Boeing 787 out of choice.

### "worst flight I have been on"
This Thomson Airways flight was the worst I have ever been on. Very long queues to drop off our bags at Gatwick, despite checking in online. There was only one queue for all Thomson flights. A 90 mins queue was not a great start to our holiday. The only positive is the inflight entertainment screen was good, however the same films were shown on the way out as the return and Thomson didn't provide adapters to use my own headphones. The seat width and aisles are way too narrow. I'm a size 10 and I just fitted in the seat. I was on the aisle with my partner in the middle and we couldn't both sit side by side comfortably as we had to share a tiny arm rest. The aisles are so narrow that other passengers and the crew were hitting me every time they passed which means I didn't get any sleep. People tried to stand in the aisle next to me/half on top of me and weren't stopped by the crew. No footrest is provided for the seat which meant I could only touch the floor on tip toes (I'm 5"4) which was very uncomfortable. Breakfast panini was inedible. On the way, other passengers were drinking their own duty free without being stopped by the crew. The man next to me got through a whole bottle of whisky and stank to the point of making me wretch. They were using the free soft drinks for mixers which the crew happily gave out - meaning there was no soft drinks left (as I was rudely told by the crew) when I asked for one! Never again will I fly with Thomson.

### "a huge thank you"
Can't fault anything about our Thomson Airways flights from Birmingham to Skiathos return. My husband was taken ill and the crew couldn't have done enough for us. There was a paramedic onboard who also helped us. One of the stewards stayed with me until my son met me in the terminal, helped with with our cases, passports and couldn't have done anymore for us - so a huge thank you.

### "Flights were alright"
Leeds Bradford to Ibiza return with Thomson Airways. The flights were on time, although one awful rush through security in Ibiza due to pitifully slow Thomson check-in procedures. Flights were alright, no more or no less. The landing at Leeds Bradford was one of the worst I have experienced in many years of flying. On touch down, the pilot hammered the brakes so hard that passengers were thrown forward, and one could hear all the cases in overhead bins being sent in a forward direction. What was that all about?

### "delayed 5 hours 40 minutes"
Our Thomson Airways flight from Ibiza to Bristol was delayed by 5 hours 40 minutes. We were given food after 2 hours, no choice but to eat it or leave it. Surely we should have had at least a drink after 4 hours. Some other passengers did not receive anything as the annoucement was in bad English by a Spanish staff member. When the passengers who did not eat told the cabin crew, they told them they could not provide any free food onboard the flight.

### "toilet seat lid keeps falling down"
I can't believe that no-one has mentioned the toilets and in particular the toilet seats on Thomson Airways Boeing 787! On the way out I thought it was just a 'dodgy' seat, but I had the same problem doing back too! My husband also said the same thing! Ladies - if you sit on the seat, the toilet seat lid keeps falling down and hitting you in the back. Gents, if you tinkle standing up you will have to hold on to the seat or risk causing an embarrassing injury or accidentally tinkling on the seat if you aren't paying attention. I have never experienced this on any other aircraft and we are well travelled.

### "their response was clearly sarcastic"
Thomson Airways from Manchester to Mexico return. If you pay to pick your seats, you can check in online and do this 14 days before travel. If you don't pay, you can do this 7 days before check in and gamble that everyone else hasn't paid for allocated seats in the 7 days before. Clearly a large percentage don't pay this extra charge and there should still be ample opportunity to get seats together (for 2 people. However it seems that Thomson fix their site to make you think there aren't 2 together by marking seats with an 'x' on the plan. However you could somehow phone and pay, and these 'x's would magically disappear. Both there and back we got seats together by queuing early at the airport, thus proving their seating plan was a lie and pushing people to pay. I complained the day I arrived in Mexico. Their 'pre-travel' team did nothing other than send an acknowledgement of receipt. In 10 days, I chased 3 times before flying back - and received no response. Days after arriving home, having chased again, they finally responded with, 'as you've now travelled, you need to send your complaint to the 'after-care team, we hope you had a nice holiday'. They didn't forward any of my correspondences, their response was clearly sarcastic, and despite now entering into October, my correspondences with 'aftercare' have continually been ignored. Complete contempt, ignorance and arrogance. How dare they treat decent people who feel genuinely ripped off by ignoring them.

### "I thought service would be better"
Long queues at Gatwick check in, no baggage drop, even though we had printed our boarding passes and had already checked in online. Major delay in departing from UK, Thomson Airways did not give a valid explanation for the cause of delay. The cabin staff were miserable, no greetings or any conversation - it felt like they did not want to be there, never seen such misery! No entertainment, no water or food, unless you want to pay for a small water or headphones Having paid almost £1200 for three tickets to Eygpt, was am so dissapointed with the service from Thomson Airways. I knew this was a budget airline, but because of what we paid for our flights, I thought the service would be better. It seems that budget really does mean budget, don,t expect any customer service, just hope that you reach your destination quickly! On returning to UK, we were delayed again. I would never use Thomson again and would not recommend. Pay abit more and stick to the well known carriers.

### "Would fly Thomson Airways again"
Our Thomson Airways flight to Malta (TOM4266) was scheduled to depart at 17:55, we pushed back on time but departed at 18:30 due to the airport being busy. We arrived in Malta 20 monutes behind schedule but didn't bother us that much. The cabin was comfortable, however the seats could have been better. The crew were very pleasant. Would fly Thomson again.

### "new Eatery menu to be pretty good"
Our Thomson Airways plane was clean and comfortable. Cabin crew in my opinion behaved with professionalism and look the part in their smart uniforms. Information during the journey from the Captain is good. I find their new Eatery menu to be pretty good and is just enough on a short haul flight. I really can't fault it.

### "unacceptable queue at bag drop"
Unacceptable queue at Thomson Airways bag drop from 0415 to 05.50hrs, for our Birmingham to Dalaman flight. Bag drop had the same queue as check in, only four check in desks open. No time for a drink or bite to eat and had to go right to gate for departure. Thomson Airways seem to have little regard for customers - see other reviews on the non exsistant bag drop!

### "a good amount of legroom"
A very good flight with Thomson from East Midlands to Dalaman. All staff were very polite and helpful. The catering was all very satisfactory. The aircraft was clean and comfortable for a 4 hour flight. There was a good amount of legroom.

### "staff very friendly and happy "
Travelled from Gatwick to Dalaman with Thomson Airways, the 5th year in a row I've flown them. Had no problems, both flights on time, staff very friendly and happy to help. Good announcements from the flight deck keeping us informed, only one negative is the check in time at Gatwick, but they went as quick as possible. Look forward to travelling on the Boeing 787 next year with them.

### "dropped seat tray to find grime and dust"
Nine Thomson Airways flights all going to different parts of the UK from Cyprus within 3-4 hours of each other. To say check in was busy was an understatement. Told when we reached the front, to send my kids to get a place in the security queue, which ran the length of the airport twice, while we booked in. Another hour and fifteen minutes later we reached passport control. Once through, our flight was boarding. No time for duty free or coffee. Straight on the bus and gone. Never again. Absolutely diabolical. Plane was filthy, dropped the seat tray to find grime and dust, not been cleaned for sometime.

### "first and last time with Thomson Airways"
First and last time with Thomson Airways. Have used budget airlines before so not expecting luxury, but the airport service for this airline is horribly inefficient! At both Luton and Mahon the queue for 'bag drop' was the longest of all airlines by a long shot, in fact on the way out people barely made their flights. Two hour delay in the way back, now all still waiting for baggage, all other airlines have come through and cleared already. Flight itself fine, the other stuff ruins it.

### "travelling as a party of 6 we were split up"
The long Thomson Airways check in at Manchester was horrendous, we arrived 2.5 hrs prior to check in but when we asked the staff about bag drop, they said it's all one queue - so what's the point. We were eventually called forward because our flight was due to take off at 09:15, we got through at 08:45. What's more annoying is that we had pre booked a lounge, the flight was delayed by 30mins so we managed to get 10 mins in a lounge we had paid extra for. Not happy with the start. The aircraft had been changed and as we were travelling as a party of 6 we were split up on rows 30 and 47. The legroom was ok, but it was as though they had forgotten to put any padding on the seat, really uncomfortable. Outbound crew okay. Return flight was on the Boeing 787 so we were sat together, but I'm not sure what the point of printing off your own boarding cards are, because they took them off us and gave us new ones! The crew on the way back weren't as friendly. Normally we book flights only, but we were going out for our daughters wedding, so not sure I would fly with them again.

### "£50 for a 10kg carry on"
I spent hours trying to get Thomson Airways website to work and accept my card for an advance luggage payment. When this didn't work, I couldn't get through to them on the phone, and the only alternative was to pay double at the airport. That's £50 each way for a 10kg carry on (their allowance is only 5kg).

### Thomson Airways customer review
Our first experience on Thomson Airways Boeing 787, London to Cancun return. The Boeing 787windows are bigger, but I didn't notice it was quieter. Light show - not sure what the point of that is! However, on the way out my partner had no screen/console for the entire 10 hour trip, on the way back mine went kaput after 5 hours. Not good on a long haul flight. My partner, who is wide-shouldered and thick necked (think bodybuilder, not fat) found the seats uncomfortable as they obviously conform to a standard body shape, Also for him the head supports were uncomfortable being too narrow. The staff were friendly but very busy, they did try a few things to fix the screen issues. We got a £15 compensation (hey!) for the lack of screen on the way out, but nothing for mine packing up on the way back. Harder to swallow as we'd paid extra for the extra leg room seats (row 30 out and 10 back). We noticed on the outward leg that the loo was leaking water into the D,E,F seats of row 30. Also aromas are often wafting about in that area! Overall not impressed, we will stick to Virgin for our next long haul.

### "you expect more for your money"
First time flying with Thomson and I think the last if I can help it. They took a while to offer the first drink and for the food to come out also and when it did it was awful. All this on the flight out. You're not offered nibbles free, you have to pay. The staff acted like they didn't want to be there and had a slight attitude like they were talking to children! The flight back wasn't any better, attitude, food was awful again and for an 11hr flight you'd expect more for your money. Most of the duty free run out because premium seat customers were served first?

### Thomson Airways customer review
Bad start with nobody at Manchester airport explaining that "night before bag drop" could go straight to desk so spent 90 minutes queuing to book luggage in. No issues with outbound flight but cabin crew seemed to be unmotivated and slightly aloof. Six hour delay on return journey and only contact with Thomson Airways was when told on transfer bus, given a 15EUR food voucher at check in and that was it - family behind us came from different resort and didn't realise there was a delay until we told them! Staff on return flight stressed due to delays and one attendant chewing gum! Overall a bad experience and Thomson Airways seems to have a staff morale problem.

### Thomson Airways customer review
First time flying with Thomson, sad to say was very disappointed. Our seats were double booked, we paid for extra leg room but sadly were moved to the very last row of plane as they gave the seats to another couple. When we told them onboard they asked us to move again to let some one else sit together, never even offered complimentary drinks. Then on the way home a week later we had to sit apart, filled in a complaint, got a refund for seats but still wating on an apology.

We have travelled with Thomson / first choice long haul for past 15 years and on the Boeing 787 for the last 4 holidays - usually premium class, but this time economy. Each time we have travelled the service and staff have become worse. Poor service less and less offered. Free drinks service in August, they came around twice and now you can't even have a cup of tea or coffee, soft drinks or alcohol only. If your last to be served it was a choice of whatever was left and this was on the first drinks round - long delays in meal service to getting a cup of tea or coffee. After your meal getting a 'warm' drink is more appropriate - only one cup served, when they used to come round and offer a second cup. At one time Premier travellers had the privilege of bags off the carousel first, but that's gone. For the price of travelling on this airline, standards have slipped.

Booked seat only to Skiathos (Greece) at a cost of £1100 for two passengers. Aircraft was a B757 an old bird but clean and tidy inside. Seats had plenty of room. We boarded the plane and then told we were delayed for 1.5 hrs, the captain kept us informed and even walked through the cabin to talk to us. Very good. Cabin crew manager was great, also in the cabin talking to passengers. In the air great flight, good crew, only complaint was the price of drinks £4.99 per miniature. £1.30 for a can of Coke. Return flight yet again on B757, clean, cabin crew manager was excellent, did notice a crew member at the front chewing gum. Cabin service very good, 2 drinks services / hot snacks, sale of duty free. Overall excellent flights, but very expensive, also bombarded with pa asking for money for charities.

### Thomson Airways customer review
I have flown with Thomson Airways many times, and flights have been very good. Most recently I flew on one of Thomson's 737s with the new Sky Interior, which is more modern compared to their other aircraft. The leather seats are comfortable, and extra legroom seats are worth the extra cost. The cabin crew are usually friendly and helpful. Thomson's inflight magazine keeps me entertained for most of my flight, and looking out of the window passes the rest of the time! Overhead screens provide information about the flight. The disappointment for me is the food. There isn't a massive selection, especially for vegetarians. The check-in staff at BHX are miserable as sin. Aside from that, once you're onboard it's really quite good.

### Thomson Airways customer review
Travelled on a family holiday to Mallorca from Birmingham with Thomson airways. Initial impressions were good. We boarded on time at BHX and the aircraft looked beautiful in the morning sun with a great livery. The cabin was showing it's age but was relatively clean and the seats looked ok. We paid extra for additional legroom towards the front of the aircraft which made a big difference. It seemed very cramped in the standard economy seat but you expect this. We were hit with ATC slot delays on both legs of our return trip which is not uncommon on this route in peak season. Thomson charge for everything nowadays and do not provide and inflight meal. There is the option to buy food onboard and again this is standard across short routes with non scheduled carriers. Unfortunately as with every flight the crew can make or break your experience no matter what aircraft or route. On our outbound leg the cabin crew were uninterested, rarely smiled and not even particularly efficient. They simply looked like they did not want to be there which is a shame on an aircraft full of holiday makers. Thankfully the crew on our return flight were much friendlier and did their utmost to make up for a 3 hour delay in PMI caused by ATC. Overall with Thomson you have to have low expectations of you have flown full service scheduled previously. They are an airline that is in a very competitive market for short haul sun destinations and it is clear that cost cutting has been made to compete with the likes of easyjet and Ryanair. If the crew outbound had made more effort I would have scored higher.

### Thomson Airways customer review
Beware, Thomson's website lets you think you have booked your seat but actually you have not. I prebooked my seats on the first available day with a screen shot to prove it. Just before the flight I received the email to check in on line and I was horrified to find I did not have my prebooked seats. I had paid £500 to be sat in separate rows to my husband. A massive thank you to the couples who swapped seats so me and my husband could sit in the seats behind each other. I complained before I left after multiple conflicting emails they more or less admitted to making a mistake. On return again they admitted to a problem with their website but no compensation was offered. I will say the airline and resort staff were very understanding and helpful

### Thomson Airways customer review
Flew the Dreamliner to Dubrovnik and had an excellent flight. Leg room was very good and air conditioning, temperature and lighting were all comfortable, the lighting being particularly good as it seems to be a type of mood lighting. Flight was very quiet even on our return journey when we were sitting above the engines and at one point we felt like the plane wasn't even moving. Cabin crew were all professional and were quick to serve the passengers and there seemed to be plenty of food although we only purchased water and crisps on our return journey (having bought sandwiches at the airport). I think Thomson however could bring their food and drink prices down as a majority of the passengers had brought their own food and drink onboard on both outbound and return flights. We had checked in online which seems to be the norm for Thomson nowadays and had pre-chosen our seats which I think is a must. Flight was on time outbound and was 10 minutes late departing on return but this was because of the plane in front of us waiting for the runway. The captain explained the delay before takeoff and made up the time on the flight. I would fly the Dreamliner again.

### Thomson Airways customer review
Very poor service. Could not be seated together and were split all over the plane. This seemed to be the case for a lot of people. Answer - nothing they could do as it was full. This was sorted but not by the staff but by the passengers. Lack of food on the plane. Basic needs covered but lack of customer focus or service.

### Thomson Airways customer review
I flew with Thomson Airways on the 15th July and the 25th July 2015. Both aircrafts were Boeing 737-800 and both flights left on time. The seats were comfortable and you could sleep on very easily. They were very wide and the legroom was really good. The cabin crew were helpful and friendly and the food was very good. Prices for the food wasn't expensive and both planes were clean. The airports were well run and ground staff were good.

### Thomson Airways customer review
I normally fly with Virgin, hence I was a little uncertain about the journey. The journey both going and coming home was excellent. The staff were lovely. The pilot gave the passengers info as and when needed. From start to finish I could not fault it. I will travel with Thomson again.

### Thomson Airways customer review
This is not my first Dreamliner flight however I am at a loss with the hype. Seat pitch is great and previously the inflight entertainment was however not on the June 15. Food OK however biggest gripe was only 2 drinks run for a 12.5hours flight and had I not taken my own drinks I would have been dehydrated. Every visit to the galley staff were on a break and drinks not available or a promise they would be around in 10 mins however they weren't.

### Thomson Airways customer review
Just did Florida out and back on Boeing 787, not impressed. Seat 20B, leg room okay, but seat seemed very narrow and I felt squashed (I am a size 14). Toilets were the smallest I have seen on any plane. Staff were great, food just okay.

### Thomson Airways customer review
Cabin was hot - staff were curt rather than unfriendly but they lacked any warmth. Circled waiting for wind to drop and then endured an awful landing, had no advance warning of the type of landing to expect. Whilst arline cannot help the weather they can control cabin temperature and keep passngers informed. Return flight was better to be fair but cost us £29 for food and drink which was adequate rather than great quality and many items had run out.

### Thomson Airways customer review
Not flown with Thomson Airways for quite a while so was a little concerned with the poor reviews. We flew premium cabin to Puerto Vallarta, Mexico. From getting on the aircraft we were very happy with the service provided by the cabin crew, they were very helpful at all times. The aircraft itself was excellent, lots of inflight entertainment, very comfortable seats - we were on row 2. Food and drinks were very good, will fly the Dreamliner again.

### Thomson Airways customer review
Read a load of reviews complaining about legroom issues. I'm 6ft 4 and was absolutely fine on the plane. Ok it wasn't the most comfortable I'd been in my life, but it's like sitting on a coach for 4 hours. It's bearable. We had checked in at Birmingham within 20 mins and had an alright flight. Coming back, Dalaman airport was madness! Also, a woman had a panic attack on take off coming back and the crew were good in helping her. I've read these reviews and come to this conclusion though: if you're expecting a silver service, top class flying experience and are measuring Thomson against Singapore airlines, you're going to be let down. Massively. But, if you're realistic then you'll be fine. As I say, 6 foot 4, long legs. I didn't expect masses of legroom, I didn't pay for extra space. I was fine. I was just grateful they didn't lose my bag.

### Thomson Airways customer review
Excellent aircraft, comfy seats and plenty of food and drinks. Our son who is autistic was petrified and the crew were brilliant in their manner and care for him during the flight. Even the First officer came out to talk to him and reassure him. Got off plane feeling fresh and rested and no usual jetlag feelings. Brilliant all round.

### Thomson Airways customer review
We recently travelled on TOM7654. The aircraft appeared to be new and had funky lighting. Seat pitch on this type of aircraft is adequate and the service offered was proffesional and polite. The snack offerings do seem quite expensive, but the drink prices are on par with other airlines we have flown with who don't offer complimentary drinks. What was disappointing was the behaviour of a group of middle aged women, who thought it was acceptable to shout, scream and chant for the whole journey, the crew did try and reprimand the group several times but to no avail. It just resulted in child like hushing and then more shouting. The group also turned on the crew after landing. I would happily fly this airline again, but if this is the sort of customer Thomson is attracting I think I'd have to look elsewhere.

### Thomson Airways customer review
Booked our flights 6 months in advance. We were immediately placed on Norwegian Airways. Tried for 6 months to book our seats, no luck. Backwards and forwards by both airlines. We were flying out on our honeymoon, ended up being separated. Submitted a complaint prior to flight, no point, as Thomson only responded long after we returned from our holiday. The response: sorry, but congratulations on your marriage. Why did we pay the same amount for seats as everyone else, but did not have the same benefit of booking our seats as most could. Never again.

### Thomson Airways customer review
Myself and my family flew from Cardiff to Palma on 5th june, during some turbulence my granddaughter spilled hot chocolate over herself. Immediately, one of the cabin crew took charge of the situation, calmly and efficiently treating my granddaughter with gel packs. She was kind and I have nothing but oraise for her. For the rest of the flight she checked on my granddaughtet regularly we were all very grateful for her help.

### Thomson Airways customer review
Outbound Seats 29A/B, return Seats 4A/B. Very happy with both sets of seats on pitch and width. Staff very slow both ways in providing food and drink for a 3 hour flight, also they do not seem to stock enough food for both ways. Both out and return the aircraft had in flight entertainment fitted but used for flight map only, it would have been nice to have a film. Thomson seem to be reluctant to invoke their own conditions on seating rules, there was at least one passenger who did not comply and I felt very sorry for the person who had to sit next to them.

### Thomson Airways customer review
The queue at Glasgow and Rhodes was completely inacceptable. Queued for nearly 2 hours at Rhodes, rep said this is a weekly occurence. Nearly a riot when Glasgow passengers called forward from passengers who had been queuing for 2 hours. Spoke to harassed Thomson staff at Glasgow who said they were  sick of  getting it in the neck daily.

### Thomson Airways customer review
Having flown with Thomson as a regular customer, I travelled on the Dreamliner for the first time. The plane itself seemed larger than normal with more head height and seats had more leg room than standard planes. The on-board choice of entertainment was good with a large selection of movies and games. Refreshments and food were all included in the travel price, which made it easier than usual. Despite this I found the staff's uniform fairly casual, as all staff had different attire, and did not have standardised hair or uniform. On the returning flight, staff professionalism was much worse than on out bound flight, as staff were regularly making comments that they were hungry whilst serving customers, needed a break etc. Whilst one member of the crew even decided to apply her lipstick whilst serving a customer drinks! I feel the quality of the planes themselves have improved, although the staff professionalism and dress code should be analysed.

### Thomson Airways customer review
I haven't even got on the plane yet and I can already advise you not to book your flights / holiday with Thomson. As a family of 2 adults and 1 under 2 year old they have positioned us in separate seats both on the flight out there and on the way back. This seems like a clear plan to ensure families pay an extra £19.99 per person to move so they can be next to each other. Along with that the online check in will not let you move one person next to the other (even with a vacant seat) but to gain maximum money from you they make you move both seats. On call their customer services we were lied to (we out witted them) on several occasions and once each lie was proved they would come up with a different excuse as to why we were given the seats we were in. I will never book a holiday with Thomson again and would advise you not to do so either, worse than the economy air lines for extra charges.

### Thomson Airways customer review
TOM2560, 22/5/15. I hope I don't have to fly with Thomson ever again. When we arrived for our flight just over 2 hours before we were due to take off, the queue for the check in desks in the airport was already out of the departure area and up a corridor where we blocked the path of people arriving back in Manchester. It became apparent that Thomson had several full flights all departing at a similar time so we all had to form one queue for 10 check in desks. I have never seen such a big queue for check in desks. It took so long to check in that we barely had time to grab a pre-packed sandwich in the departure lounge before we had to board and with 2 small children at 7am, it was no fun at all.

Flew to Lanzarote (TOM7414) and (TOM7415) from EMA to ACE, 10th July 2014. Modern fleet of 737, 757, 767 and 787 aircraft for both short and long haul flights. Customer service is excellent and in-flight eatery menu is very good! Staff on-board and in the airport are more smartly dressed and provide an excellent service.

Flew LGW(N) to Alicante 02/05/15 returning 16/05/15. We are both disabled travellers but love to travel and do so whenever we can without assistance but this time for my wife we did request assistance none offered at Gatwick? Flight out on time and OK. Our return flight was delayed by a few hours due to a passenger who had been drinking all night back in Gatwick. We were in row 8 and by the time the trolley got to us they were already out of bacon rolls and other goodies. One of the cabin crew were very unhelpful and didn't care what we all thought and like many of you state I believe its because they already have your money. Another cabin crew member did try to help but she was in the minority. Overall Thomson weren't worth the money not for the flights nor their accommodation in our case. The aircraft was old and tired as were the crew to be honest. Flying BA now so 23 kgs and on board food and drinks at no extra cost.

Booked holiday with Thomson during August 2014 for 2 weeks in Algarve flying from Glasgow to Faro on 7th May returning 21st May. We assumed it was Thomson as we have been on the same flight several times. Found out January 2015 that the Flight was by Europe Airpost. Seems they are the French equivalent of Jet2. Passengers by day Mail/Cargo by night. Old and worn 737 but we left on time and landed out and back. Only 3 cabin crew. Limited trolley service. All announcements were initially in French for heavily accented English. Only problem was returning from Faro. This Airport is becoming a nightmare. At Faro at 8.30 am. Through check-in and Security by 9.00am flight booked to leave at 10.15. Saw queue for passport control was very long snaking all around bars and shops. Entered queue at 9am and at 10am were miles from Passport Control. Only way we caught flight was that Airport Staff were calling our flights.

### Thomson Airways customer review
I travelled to Naples from Manchester on the 11th May returning on the 18th. The departure experience was horrendous with huge queues. Despite joining the queue about 2 hours before the departure time we were eventually rescued and fast tracked to security. We had no time at all to view shops before boarding. On the return the aircrew had apparently very little food left and by the time they got to us we were only able to purchase 1 bag of crisps even the last kitkat having been sold. Having expected to at least get a roll this was unacceptable. In retrospect we could have purchased something in the airport but never expected to have to do this. The aircrew were being harassed by others in the same situation explaining the demand on the outward bound flight had been unprecedented. This was not very convincing. To add insult to injury on my later visit to the toilet I witnessed a crew member unwrapping and consuming a hot bacon roll. It's ok for some! The crew later announced proudly that everything on the duty free was available. My partner said that even if she had wanted something she certainly would not have purchased it. Sorry Thomson but despite a great resort and hotel experience this is the last time we will be flying with Thomson.

### Thomson Airways customer review
Travelled to Cancun on TOM186 Dreamliner plane excellent service on board dreadful food inedible unlimited drinks a joke one drink served on a 10+ hour flight. Flight attendants very unhelpful on return flight but then Thomsons have had your money and your holiday is finished as far as they are concerned. I suggest that Thomsons look at the on-board service forget free drinks and go back to selling them and get new food suppliers.

### Thomson Airways customer review
Flew from Gatwick to Palma Mallorca on 5th May 2015 and had a rather unusual experience. We had the seats immediately behind the seats near the emergency exit. The couple who sat in the seats in front were 'big'. The lady who sat immediately next to the emergency exit had some difficulty fitting her 'bulk' into the seat and she must have had an uncomfortable flight because much of her bulk spilled over to her partner who was just as bulky - both although around 5.6/7 in height were easily in the 20 plus stone class. She could only get her seat belt on with the assistance of her husband. There is no way these individuals should have been given flights in that location and before you say why didn't I say something all this was done in full view of the steward - he must have seen that the couple would have been unable to assist in an emergency and their physical bulk would have impeded any emergency exit from the aircraft. Are there no checks on individuals?

### Thomson Airways customer review
We were telephoned by First Choice to upgrade to premium for our flight Gatwick to Jamaica 20th May. We were told we would get extra leg room fast track for security and check in up graded meals and free drinks. This was the first time we have upgraded on a flight and my husband bought it for us for my birthday present at some £500+. The check in and fast track at London Gatwick was good and fast. The seats had good leg room and were quite comfortable. The staff were good. We had already seen most of the films - poor small selection. The drinks were free but then so were the drinks for economy. The food was not good. The passengers from economy used premier toilets so I had to queue. For the flight home to Gatwick there was no fast track system for premier even though we had been told by First Choice that it was included so we had to spend more money and buy VIP lounge tickets for MOBAY at Grantly Adams airport (the lounge and system was excellent). The flight home meals were not good and upon arrival at Gatwick economy passengers were allowed to disembark before Premium. We feel that the £500 was a waste of money overall and that we were misled by the sales team at First Choice wjo sold us the upgrade. The flight felt safe with good time take off and landing. We would not buy premier class again and feel ripped off by First Choice/Thomson.

### Thomson Airways customer review
Our flight was Gatwick to Montego Bay. Have flown with Thomson many times and always been very happy but not impressed on this occasion. Didn't realise Thomson had switched to complimentary drinks which is fine providing you can have a supply of drinks when you want them. Like many people I like to enjoy a few drinks on flights as this is part and parcel of my holiday and was disappointed when the drinks trolley came around and told I could only have one small can of beer despite my request to purchase them which I'd done in the past before complimentary drinks were introduced. To be fair the flight attendant did pass me a second small can on her return to the galley but an hour or so later when I popped to the galley to request another drink I was told rather rudely by one of the attendants that I would have to wait until the refreshments trolley next appeared after the duty free had been offered. When I politely asked roughly how long this would be she said "after we've offered the duty free" and would not give a time. She even had the front to tell me "I was holding her up". I'm a middle aged man and a responsible drinker and expect to be able to have a couple of pints on a 10 hour flight whilst watching or listening to the entertainment which is very good. On the return trip I upgraded to Premium and the service was very good. My comments and scores relate to the outbound trip on economy. Thomson - please take note and get the complimentary drinks flowing or start charging as before.

I flew from Bristol to Fuerteventura on 15th April 2015 on a Boeing 757-200. I am over 6 feet tall and in recent years I have had two major operations on both legs. If I sit for any length of time I suffer from cramp in my legs and I need to stand and stretch. I therefore paid for an upgrade to a seat with extra legroom. After I had paid I went online to reserve my seat. I was the first passenger to book a seat in the four rows of extra legroom. I wanted a seat in the aisle in order that I did not inconvenience fellow passengers when I frequently had to stand. However the Thomson booking system would not allow me to reserve an aisle seat and would only allow booking from the window seats inwards if these were vacant. I tried a number of times but received the same message so I had no choice but to select a window seat 8F on both flights. I checked in online and on my arrival at Bristol Airport about 2 hours before the flight I was pleased to see there was no queue and I was able to check in my hold luggage very quickly and efficiently. When I boarded the plane and sat in my seat I was disappointed with the actual legroom space that was provided and also the comfort of my seat. Unfortunately all the seats with extra legroom were occupied so I was unable to change seats. When I examined the seat cushion it was thinner than the centre and aisle seat cushions. During the flight there was a very cold draught running along by the windows. I asked a stewardess if I could have a blanket but I was told that they were not carried. The flight took off on time and arrived at Fuerteventura 15 minutes earlier than schedule. However during the flight I had to inconvenience my fellow passengers in the centre and aisle seats on a number of occasions so that I could stand and stretch. My return flight to Bristol was on 29th April 2015. This was also on a Boeing 757-200 but it was a newer plane and had a slightly different layout. Fortunately my seat 8F had a far better seat cushion but the legroom was identical to the outgoing flight. When the plane had fully boarded I noticed that the majority of seats in the four rows were unoccupied. I approached a stewardess and I asked if it would be possible for me to move to one of the many unoccupied aisle seats and I was astounded when she refused telling me that she was going to fill these seats with families from other parts of the plane. I therefore had to endure the same discomfort of sitting in the window seat and had to inconvenience my fellow passengers in order that I could gain access to the aisle and stand to stretch my legs and I had actually paid for this privilege. I would not recommend paying the supplement for extra legroom.

I flew from Birmingham UK to Kefalonia on 25 May 2014 on early morning flight. Thomson check-in process (and security check) at Birmingham was horrendous and so slow that despite arriving well above two hours before departure we had no time to get food before we flew and there is no proper meal / breakfast available on the Flight. A miserable experience to start our holiday. Thomson reps only response was that "this is normal". I can't recommend Thomson or B'ham airport- hope it has improved for 2015.

### Thomson Airways customer review
Flew out to Thailand April 10th on the new Thomson Dreamliner Premium Club and must say it was well worth the extra money irrespective of what has been said on this forum. The leg room for me was great as I am 6' 1" and usually suffer in most airline seats however the foot rest was a waste of time. Apparently the seats have been changed on Alfie in Premium and having the screens in the back of the seats was a better idea than the previous seats. I had to actually lean forward to touch the screen to access the entertainment that's how much room there is. The in flight service there and back was first class and the drinks never stopped for a moment. The food wasn't bad either considering its airline food and it was nice having a menu to choose from. The electrically tinting windows are an excellent idea rather than shutting of the light totally we had two windows in our seating position so we could dim the farthest window to watch a film whilst retaining some light. Being Premium you are boarded first and off loaded first which is nice but I did not see any resentment among economy passengers which has been suggested elsewhere!

Flew out to Sanford Orlando from BHX on 27/3/15 on a six week old Dreamliner 787. Fantastic plane really impressed with the spaciousness larger windows and lighting and a very pleasant and attentive cabin crew. I am a nervous flyer and due to very strong head wind our flight took longer than usual and was quite turbulent. The crew were very kind to me and helped me to relax into the flight. The food was good and an excellent drinks service. The entertainment selection was also very good. Leg room great (we were in a middle row seats 18 DE and F) and no problems if the person in front reclined their seat. However the return flight on 10.04.15 was less pleasant. Again quite a bumpy ride - the seatbelt signs were on and off for the first four hours which was unfortunate but can't be helped. The Cabin Crew businesslike but totally disinterested no eye contact or engagement whatsoever Food and drink thrust at you and I had no blanket! The area around our seats (19 DE and F) had a very strong smell of vomit the whole journey and the plane looked a bit grubby. The toilet by row 30 ran out of toilet paper and paper towels half way through too! Obviously with an overnight flight the crew leave you to rest and darken the cabin but I don't think many people actually did sleep as we were all still on Florida time - it was very hot on the plane and people all around me were complaining of being thirsty - there was quite a large time gap between drinks service. A lady across from our party was feeling unwell and had no assistance from the cabin crew at all! Her family were left to attend to her and left with a pile of dirty tissues and sick bags around them. Not good enough Thomson! Customer service should be of equal quality with all of your Cabin crews whatever time of flight. 10/10 for staff outbound but only 2/10 inbound.

We to flew out to GOA from LGW on 14 Feb 15 for 21 days and all was fine until about to land. We diverted to Mumbai due to fog which was fine but the flight crew filed an incorrect flight plan back to Goa and then ran out of hours. It was then farcical as they tried to get the crew flown up from Goa to replace ours but this did not work so we eventually got off many hours later. The immigration were not ready and did not like our Goa landing details so that added to the wait. The hotel was fine but by now we were knackered and fell asleep easily. At Goa we arrived at the hotel when it was dark so two days were missed. The meals were poor on the way back and being in premium I expected more. The music was missed but listened to new films instead but I think the B787 are overused as already you can see tiredness in the new aircraft. The only reason for using them again is that they are direct (usually) and living in Belfast already means a connection flight.

We flew from Exeter to Egypt and the trip out went great on time and the cabin crew could not have been better. We flew out on the 26th Feb and back on the 12th March. But the flight back could not have been worse. The cabin crew could not be bothered .There was now duty frees left on the flight and the plain was dirty I found used tissues down the side of my seat. The toilets were disgusting. We have flown with Thomson quite a few times but this was the worst flight we have ever had. Please note The comments below are based on the flight home.

Travelled to Punta Cana 6/3/15. Ok flight no footrests on seats. Return trip on 13/3/15 TOM051 check in for premium was awful worse by far than economy. Seat was broken so that foot-plate wouldn't go down had to have maintenance onboard to allow takeoff. He fixed seat so footrest wouldn't work nor would seat recline! Most uncomfortable long haul flight I have had. Food was all cheese - cheese starter cheese dessert cheese and biscuits - would have liked an alternative! No music on channels due to "copyright" issues. Flight attendants not very pleasant was really disappointed in Thomson premium.

We flew out to Cancun with Thomson on the 1st March returning on the 15th. Flew Premium Economy both ways and Thomson did what was promised. No complaints at all. We flew on the Dreamliner both ways lovely aircraft with lots of room. My only gripe was the way the seating was configured on the way out. The IFE screen had to be pulled up from the middle of the seating which made it very awkward to try and get out of the seat if you were by the window. Not so on the way back as all the screens were seat back position. On this overall experience I would fly long haul with Thomson again.

We flew from Birmingham to Barbados on 6.2.15 on the Dream Maker. It was a brilliant start to our P&O cruise. I didn't know that we would be flying on the Dreamliner. An excellent aircraft very spacious light airy and clean. We didn't have any jet lag going down to Barbados or when arriving home. The cabin crew going down to Barbados were brilliant very friendly attentive and welcoming. Coming home the cabin crew were not interested in the slightest. No welcome no smiles no conversation no nothing. Meal was just banged onto the table and they walked on. Food going down was very good food coming home very poor. A crew member did a collection on the way home for charity. A lot of us had money ready but the crew member didn't even stop she just kept on walking. We would definitely fly on a Dreamliner again the aircraft can't be faulted. The Customer Service for some crew members is definitely well below the standard expected.

My friend and I returned to Heathrow from Barbados on 16th March 2015. We travelled on a Dreamliner but it was a different model to our outbound journey on 8th March. The outbound aircraft was very comfortable apart from the headrests which force your head forward and as I have neck problems this was not comfortable at all. The return journey was horrendous the headrests again force ones head forward and the recline has been drastically reduced therefore when trying to sleep ones head keeps flopping forward so we were unable to sleep after being up for almost 24 hrs. The monitor was stored in the central console making the console huge and when the seat in front was reclined there were only a few inches to try and squeeze out of the window seat which I think is also a safety issue. There is also a leg rest which can be raised if required but mine couldn't be lowered properly and as I have arthritis in my knees I was unable to move my legs and was obliged to keep getting out of my seat to exercise my legs. It was the most uncomfortable flight I had ever endured in a premium cabin and whoever designed these seats etc. should be made to sit in them for 12 hours non-stop. There was no music available throughout the flight for some reason. However on a positive note the crew were excellent helpful and courteous and the food was ok.

EMA to Marbella March 8th/15th. Aircraft was on time both outbound and inbound and clean with reasonable leg room. Staff were attentive and efficient and coffee was ok. Check in very simple with downloaded boarding cards and E-ticket. I was favourably impressed and Thomson short haul compares very well with other airlines.

I used Thomson to go to GOA on 14/2/15 for a Wedding flying from Gatwick on flight TOM 52. Flight took off on time but with about 30 minutes to go there was fog on the runway at GOA and we got diverted to Mumbai to refuel. This is when the nightmare began we sat on the runway for 10 hours Thomson could not sort the paperwork out with Indian authorities no food or drinks provided and total lack of care from Thomson. When we left the plane no help or advice we then had 300 passengers trying to get on one coach to stay overnight. In the end we had to sort out our own flight out to get to the wedding. In the end the flight landed 32 hours late and we were offered £100 compensation or nothing. I would rather stay at home than use Thomson again.

TOM50 on 13th Feb TOM51 return on 27th Feb. Was my first trip on the Dreamliner we sat in seats 5a/c outbound all was ok until we tried to recline the seats to have a nap - both seats would not recline. The staff managed to get one seat to recline mine would not budge not goo-d on an aircraft only 1 year old. Other than that they were comfortable with good service. In a previous review I read that someone had said that the centre console was difficult to get past as it jutted out and they said it was a safety hazard in emergency situation all I can say is there were no issues was easy to get past for a normal sized person. The only major issue was that there was no music channels available on both flights due to copyright laws light music helps when you want to sleep so hope the issue is sorted soon.

Tom 197 CUN-MAN 4th March. On schedule and way better experience at Cancun than on arrival. We did have an extra hour wait at the airport due to Cancuns new adjusted time zone I believe. Once on board the crew were not as surly as the outbound crew. However still seemed less than interested. The previous months outbound movies were loaded meaning the same films for everyone. The crew were unable to switch this. I was provided with a dirty blanket that had obviously been used before and repacked disgusting! The food was not fit for human consumption I have never seen so many E numbers on an ingredients label. My main concert was that the Crew seemed unable to read a PA out properly including the safety demo. This did not inspire confidence. Baggage reclaim was painfully slow at Manchester.

I have returned today after travelling to Jamaica on the Dreamliner (Alfie) and can rate this 10/10 for comfort as well as all the other areas of this flight but our return from Jamaica today we travelled on a different Dreamliner which was not so comfortable. The Alfie flight going out was very comfortable with the TV's in the back of the seats and the foot rest on the seat in front. These seats recline adequately for comfort. The return flight today was on a Dreamliner which had the TV's in the arm of the seat and the foot rest which came out from under you the seat not reclining much at all if at all not so sure whether it did recline at all. Many on our flight were under the same impression of this flight - not so comfortable at all. The arms with the TV in the centre and the dining tray on the other arm actually reduce the amount of space in the seat you have hence being less comfortable.

We travelled on TOM118 MAN-CUN 21st Feb. The crew were the rudest most surly and unprofessional crew I have flown with! The Flight deck boarded 15 minutes prior to departure in icy conditions and had obviously been shopping. The delayed departure was then compounded by the ground handler providing one de-ice rig to de-ice a Dreamliner! It took an hour for the de-ice to be completed. The food was only one option and appalling. The crew only bothered with two drinks services on a 10.45 hr flight. After sitting almost an hour with my inedible meal in front of me the crew were collecting trays when I asked about a tea with my meal. I was informed that unfortunately tea was unavailable! We found this an odd situation but on visiting the toilet I soaped my hands to discover no potable water in the sink in the extra hour it had sat on the ground in Manchester the crew had obviously not bothered to check the water levels. No hand gel provided and crew uninterested. On the plus side the leg room was great but strangely the seats were so narrow nobody fitted in them. The air conditioning was awful very stuffy and everyone was bunged up. Very disappointed!

### Thomson Airways customer review
We flew on the December 2014 (booked this holiday in January 2014) and 6 of us had paid for Premium Class. On the day we we're flying there was no fast track there was no Priority boarding and then we got on the plane there was no premium class. Even the cabin crew acknowledged this no newspaper and then we found out that economy class received everything that we had paid extra for. Thomson have taken our hard earned money of us and given us nothing in return after speaking to various other passengers they we're given one way refunds but us absolutely nothing.

We flew Premium to PVR and back 14/02/15 returning on an overnight flight 28/02/1015. Small delay both ways but nothing to cause any inconvenience. We flew out on Alfie and returned on Living the Dream (787 Dreamliners). Both aircraft were clean and the extra touches such as the blankets pillows newspaper and cosmetic bags are a nice touch. The Dreamliner is a wonderful aircraft such a pleasure to travel on smooth spacious and comfortable. My husband is over 6ft and is never normally comfortable during a flight however he had plenty of leg room and really enjoyed the experience of flying on the Dreamliner. The staff both ways were a credit to Thomson they were friendly and helpful kept the drinks flowing food was good and IFE plenty to choose from to keep you busy for the 11.5 hour flights. We would definitely recommend flying with Thomson and if you can spare the money go Premium it's well worth it.

Travelled to Cancun on the Thomson Dreamliner in January 2015 from Manchester. Unfortunately we didn't board on time and then it started to snow they boarded us an hour late and we sat on the tarmac for an additional four hours. I know this wasn't their fault but all they gave is in those four hours was half a cup of lukewarm water and a bite size picnic! The service in the air is good and the food not bad but although the drinks are complimentary they only offer you one drink apart from the drink of tea coffee or wine with the meal. That's not brilliant when you are on a plane for nearly 15 hours! We were impressed by the room though and the entertainment is good. Luckily the flight attendants on both journeys were lovely and I do believe that apart from the single drink and the snow I would have rated it 10.

### Thomson Airways customer review
Very small cramped seats. Flight was delayed while we were in airport for over an hour then delayed but with us actually sitting on the plane for almost another four hours and not even offered free water. Yes they let us have some tap water when we asked after trying to sell us 300 mls for £1.80.

Flew from Manchester to Punta Cana on 6/11/2014. Booked holiday and seats on Dreamliner. Paid extra for premium club. When we boarded we were on a 767 and not Dreamliner. Standard and premium seats same paid extra for bigger seat pitch paid extra for unlimited drinks which was also available in standard seating. Apparently Thomson don't have to notify passengers of change of plane they can change this if they decide. Asked for a customer review card which they said was given out on this flight they weren't they can't give me one now customer reviews are therefore untrue. Have always holidayed with Thomson - not any more. Very angry with their replies and handling of complaint.

### Thomson Airways customer review
Went to Cancun at the beginning of September 2015 for two weeks flew on the Dreamliner Premium. Other than having to limbo in and out of the window seat very nice. I consider myself to be fairly nimble but who's idea was it to put that monstrosity of a centre consul between the seat's! I mentioned it to the staff after landing at Gatwick and was told that their had been a considerable number of complaints and that they were going to change this. We fly to Mexico again in August this year in Premium on the Dreamliner but not looking forward to limboing in and out of the seat again!

Flew from Gatwick to Phuket on the Dreamliner in January 2015. Having flown on the Dreamliner before my wife and I booked our usual seats (row 39). Outbound the flight was about 30 mins late departing but that was probably due to ATC issues on the day and was no great hardship as we boarded pretty much on time. The flight to Thailand is about 11 hours going out and 12 and a half hours coming back. Service was great including the free drinks! The food was decent. Seats as usual were comfy enough. I would say that both Dreamliners we flew on could use a deep clean and a little bit of a tidy up. They are new planes but you can see they are heavily used. All in all though I have no complaints about flying Thomson - especially on the Dreamliner.

Charter flight for a skiing holiday LGW to Salzburg 17/1/15 (TOM 4686) return 24/1/15 (TOM 4687). Both flights on a new 737-800. The cabin was spotless on outbound flight and considering cleaners do not come on aboard at SZG the return cabin was also very clean. The seat pitch and width was comfortable for a short haul flight although the seats do not recline however for the length of this flight it was not needed. The redesigned overhead luggage bins permit a large amount of bags bulky coats etc to be stored without jamming them in and the locking mechanism appears to be a lot more secure than in the older 737s. The cabin crew on both flights were not only very efficient but friendly too. Outward flight took off on time and with a strong tail wind arrived in SZG 1hr 15mins later. The return flight was delayed slightly but that was due to the aircraft needing de-icing so no complaints there as I would rather fly on a safe aircraft than risk icing of the wing flaps! There were a selection of snacks (incl hot paninis that could be purchased - I didn't) but their special offer on bar drinks was reasonably priced. Charter flights used to have the reputation of treating their passengers like cattle but certainly on this flight Thomson were just as good as any scheduled carrier and compared to some "cheap airlines" a lot better. Overall a good start and finish to an enjoyable skiing holiday.

### Thomson Airways customer review
Leg room on this flight from Gatwick to Goa was about the only good thing. Seat width was average. Not great for a 9 hour flight. Food was of very poor quality and we were giver afternoon cream teas for breakfast. Drinks were poor and the ran out of tonic water on second drinks run. No tomato juice available for bloody marys. The entertainment system was poor with no music due to some licensing problem. Only flew Thomson because it was direct. Will fly scheduled airline next time even if it means hopping.

Travelled back from Mexico on the Dreamliner a night flight. The cabin crew were surly and unhelpful every task done without a smile or comment. My husband unfortunately tipped his gin and tonic over himself the stewardess did not assist him or help wipe the spillage we had to find paper tissues and serviettes ourselves. She was then extremely reluctant to provide a replacement drink We only had one drink each the entire flight if you required anything you had to go to the back of the plane to get it. The food was dreadful especially the breakfast roll what was in it defied description and we were advised there would be no tea or coffee as the crew didn't have the time! We hardly saw them for 9 hours!

Flew out on Living The Dream 787 on 10/01 returned on 25/01 LGW on Alfie - PVR in Premium. Having already flown on Alfie to Goa I noticed a few changes on Living The Dream. Had window seats both ways which can cause quite a chuckle (but not nearing the end of a 12 hour flight). Preferred the old pull down leg supports on Alfie as the newer ones that are in the chair just made my legs dangle and ache. The TV's in the seat sides are way better as on the way back the person behind kept banging the 'touch' screen. Seats seemed much harder on the Alfie. The entertainment took ages to reboot and reboot oh and reboot. Both planes quite grubby now and the seat back pockets and tray tables etc look like they could do with a sanitise. Food was nice on way out but not so great on return. Crew lovely on way out but very scruffy on way back and a particularly not nice guy with glasses in Premium on way back. None of them seemed really interested except a blonde lady in premium. Every long haul back with Tom the crew haven't been very good at all (and I heard a good few comments saying the same). Lovely smooth flight both ways considering the weather and I think the Dreamliner left me with no jet lag again. I try to avoid flying with Tom but if you have to fly long go Premium if you get the chance.

Going to Orlando April 2014 for a week and flew with Thomson for the first time (and last) to try out the new Dreamliner. A six hour delay with no apparent reason and a change of plane meant a flight not on the Dreamliner but in an older worn out "bucket". The Captain mentioned something about the plane being hit by lightning but I've heard this is a regular occurrence. We were given no details at check in but we did get £4 per person to spend at the airport at "selected" restaurants. Once on board we also had to pay for our drinks at extortionate prices and the food was not very good either. On our return from Orlando back to London our flight was delayed by more than three hours and we were told at check in that this was due to a flight crew not being available. All in all a very poor service and will advise people to be wary as since returning from my holiday last year I have read so many reports on Thomson flights being delayed and especially the Dreamliner. I'll stick to Virgin or the US companies in future.

My wife and I flew premium class to Cancun leaving Jan 11th and returning Jan 25th. The flights were very enjoyable and the service very good. The premium cabin is excellent value. As others have noted the seating can be a problem. On the outward journey we had the silly seats which make it difficult for someone in the window seat to get. Apparently these seats are being phased out. Cancun is a busy airport and there was a long wait for one of our suitcases not the fault of the airline. We also booked the Aspire lounge at Gatwick. This wasn't bad but the carpets and seats were shabby and stained.

### Thomson Airways customer review
Unfortunately I missed my Easyjet flight to Palma. I was requoted a very expensive flight to Palma the next day with Easyjet. I searched on the internet and found an alternative flight with Thomson at a great price from Luton to Palma. They provided a great service with a new 737 MAX. Certainly worth looking at for future travel arrangements.

We travelled on the Dreamliner 767 to Punta Cana on 29th December returning on 12th January 2015. I am an extremely nervous passenger. We were seated in row 23 on the way out (5 of us) we had pre booked these seats so we could all sit in a row. We were right over the wing so couldn't see a thing out of the window. Seats were comfy with plenty of leg room. Tray table was adequate. The TV's looked recycled for a new plane. Choice of films outbound wasn't up to much so didn't bother watching them. The console was too slow to have any fun playing games so just left the map on the whole way. Thank goodness for my iPad! Great smooth flight. Disappointed at the drinks service. Supposed to be complimentary drinks but only got served a drink with a meal. Food was ok piping hot. The best bit was the cream tea which was served about an hour before landing. Lovely fresh scone and plenty cream. We returned on 12th January. Plane was delayed an hour because the incoming took longer in the head wind. Prior to leaving I'd listened to far too many weather reports heralding strong winds in the Atlantic in the Jet Stream. So already 'worked up' I boarded the plane and informed cabin crew I was very nervous. The two girls in the centre of the plane (Tom113) were excellent. They explained things so well. Again my only complaint is the drinks situation. I was served one drink with my meal then when I went to the back to ask for another I was told it was juices or water only! Total flying time 8hrs. A great flight.

We flew Premium Class to Cancun and back on the Dreamliner both ways. LGW to Cancun was TUI-B in the configuration with the armrest extending a lot from the middle seat. We had selected seats in the first row though and therefore we did not have this problem. The seat was comfortable. The footrest was OK but would have been much better if you could extend it all the way up. Food and drinks very good and staff quite friendly. We kept being served pretty much throughout the whole journey. The flight back was with TUI-D which surprisingly had been re-configured. The middle seat no longer extends out the TV screens have been moved on the seat in front of you and they have also removed the footrest completely. Overall I think this is much better than the previous configuration and I assume they have been changing all 6 Dreamliners now. Finally regarding the flights I did notice a significant difference when flying on this plane. After a 10.5 hours flight we were still fresh and not so tired as I would expect. Overall a very pleasant experience.

Flew Manchester - Puerto Vallarta 11 December 2014 and returned 1 January 2015 in Premium class The only complaint was the seating design which made it virtually impossible to get from window seat to aisle and I am slim! The foot rest is pretty useless as it does not extend enough and there is no bar on the end to stop your feet sliding off. The seat was comfortable for the almost 12 hour journey. On the return trip the inflight entertainment at my seat played up and I could not receive most of the music channels despite the crew rebooting the system 3 times. Overall well worth the extra money for the extra comfort.

### Thomson Airways customer review
I found the seats on the Thomson Dreamliner a real pain. Whilst the service from crew was excellent food was good priority boarding and check-in a bonus and drinks service of good quality all of this was overshadowed by the abysmal access to my seat. The arm rest housing the in-flight entertainment console and tray projects way to far forward leaving about 20cm (8") between the armrest and the rear of the seat in front. We travelled as a group of 7 in row 2 on the outbound flight. I was in the centre seat of the three centre seats. Getting out of my seat meant stowing my TV screen and the passenger next to you and then an awkward manoeuvre past. Thank god I was sitting between my wife and a friend as physical contact is almost inevitable. Access is further limited should the passengers in front recline their seats. I mentioned the seats to the crew and they said it was a real problem reported to them by passengers all the time. We'll continue to use Thomson flights if it suits but I don't think any of us would pay the £150 each way cost of a Premium cabin seat. I've flown BA premium economy and whilst more expensive at least you can get into and out of the seats.

### Thomson Airways customer review
Travelled on the Dreamliner to Mexico in premium class. The service on the outbound leg was really great but on the return leg the crew were much more interested in laughing and joking with each other than caring for their customers. When the meal was served we had 2 choices Beef or Chicken. When I asked the crew what sauce were they in the reply was "Don't know just try it and if you don't like it we will change it if anything is left". The Dreamliner is a very nice aircraft but if you are sitting in the window seat or the middle seat it's impossible to get out when the seat in front is reclined.

TOM1442 EDI-ACE and return as TOM1443 11 / 18 Dec. Travelled in 'Economy' within the ‘extra leg room seats’ section of the cabin. E-Boarding passes for both sectors were generated at the Thomson Shop where the booking had been made. Baggage drop-off was fast. New security at EDI now is now fully operational and was efficient at the time of the process. Following an airport lounge visit (part of the package deal) there was little activity on arrival at the gate. About 20 minutes prior to the expected boarding time an announcement was made that due to an operational issue the flight was going to be operating late. Further delay messages were passed however the reason was not. I can only assume that Swissport TOMs agent at EDI are restricted or very guarded on what information passengers should be told about. Boarding 90 minutes later than scheduled was satisfactory. On board the GLA based Captain and crew apologised for delay crew transport from GLA / EDI which was delayed en-route due to snow on the motorway was the reason! The flight in a B757-200 was fine in my opinion the purchase of extra leg room about 15.25cm / 6 inches more than TOM standard’is worth it on a 4hour 30 minute flight. The crew were friendly and efficient and worked hard in providing the usual on-board sales as no refreshments are included in the basic price. The flight made up some lost time and arrived just over 1 hour late. The return flight departed on time. Again on this sector the GLA based crew worked hard at providing on board sales. The hustle and bustle of this throughout the flight does make any attempted rest difficult in an aisle seat. From observation and this does make me a little concerned a number of passengers failed to comply or just ignored the ‘fasten seat belt signs’ when they were illuminated by the flight crew. The cabin crew should perhaps have been a bit more forceful in ensuring that this requirement was observed at all times. The flight arrived into EDI 20 minutes ahead of schedule. There is no 'Inflight Entertainment' system on the TOM B757-200series. A no surprises return trip with TOM not my first choice of carrier however a means to an end!

Travelled Barbados to Manchester on the dreamliner having paid £160 extra for seats 10A and 10B on 19 December 2014. The reading light on seat 10A was not working so I was unable to read. The entertainment system was also not working. I reported both to the flight attendants who said they would reset the system but it still would not work. Tried to report these malfunctions to them again but they just were not interested. Staff were a poor advert for Thomson. I had a very boring journey and would expect these things to be working on such a new plane and not to suffer the indifference of the flight staff.

### Thomson Airways customer review
We traveled from Manchester to Cancun recently TOM148/149 and paid for the upgrade to Premium seating we were not advised that you could book seats in advance for premium but when we tried via the agent to book three seats together (three weeks in advance) we were told that adjacent seats were not available on the return journey but Thomson policy is that seats across aisles and in front/behind are "together" this is ridiculous. If three people book together well in advance they should be allocated adjacent seats at the time. For the return journey we had to move back into economy to have seats side by side refunds were refused immediately although the seats were then resold as all premier seats were taken for the return flight. The food in premier was basic and as with other reviews we were given what was left my wife had to persuade the attendant to let her change what had been thrust at her. The return flight was thankfully shorter due to following winds as the food and entertainment system was below average although the agents told us all drinks were included only those with meals are.

### Thomson Airways customer review
Travelled with Thomson's back in August and their post handling of a complaint has been shocking. Paid extra to go on their new Dreamliner and went to choose seats a week before departure but their site was "down" and were advised that seats would be allocated at the airport. On arrival it all became clear why - we were handed a letter to say there had been a last minute problem with the dreamliner and we were to travel on a bog standard plane which was no where near the class of the new Dreamliner. My family was split up and I had young children. The same happened on the return leg. I complained and got an acknowledgement a couple of days after their 28 day response time - I get the feeling they just hope you lose the will but their response was a typical pre drafted letter with zero empathy to my complaint and basically said tough. I have travelled with Thomson many times and had previously thought of them as a caring company but following their apathy I have to say I will seek alternatives if they are available.

Flew Thomsons Dreamliner Gatwick to Cancun - having travelled premium on other Thomson flights and been perfectly happy I expected a lot from the Dreamliner but it was a let down! Premium seat next to window was virtually inaccessible without squeezing past the centre metal section that houses the TV screens or physically climb over the seat. I found the seat uncomfortable within a short space of time and it does not recline far enough to be of any use. There was an issue with a shortage of premium meals on our outbound flight not helped by a grumpy stewardess who just plonked a meal in front of me and was quite put out when I said I didn't eat sausages! I was eventually given an economy meal as that was all that was left. I am aware that 2 passengers in Premium did not receive a hot meal at all as they completely ran out. It seems that whilst they offer a menu the choice is have what they've got rather than actually chose. Return flight service was little better I spoke to the stewardess on boarding and explained we'd had a problem with meals on the way out and was advised they only get what they're given and it's take it or leave it. Not impressed for the extra money paid - poor value.

MAN-Las Palmas 3rd Nov return 13th Nov. Flew out on 757 which had been refurbished. Very nice comfortable seats paid for extra leg room. Seats appeared wider than usual. Good pleasant crew throughout journey. Landed just 20 mins late. Return on 737 800 again nice seats but preferred the bigger 757 Again very pleasant and hard working crew. Kept informed by capt of weather etc. I do like the new uniform cabin crew wear. All in all very enjoyable.

Flew from Birmingham to Montego Bay on 5th November with Thomson on the Dreamliner. Honestly couldn't fault anything. Cabin crew both ways were excellent helping to reassure me as I am a nervous flyer. Seats were comfortable and very roomy contrary to some reviews that I have seen inflight entertainment was very good up to date films and good games. I can't say that I noticed a smoother flight than usual actually more bumpy (can't blame Thomson for that). Both flights on time will definitely use again!

Flew to Sanford on Dreamliner on 14/06/14. First time usually flown with Virgin. Must say the PE service was fantastic staff worked very hard and fast with drinks and food. Very comfortable seats and very quiet. No delays at Gatwick and check in super fast. Would definitely recommend. Price much cheaper than Virgin.

Flew Manchester to Mexico on 2 November (TOM 182) premium cabin. Flight was about 40 minuets late in getting away but apart from that everything was excellent. Crew were very attentive and nothing was to much trouble. Lots of refreshments on offer throughout the entire flight. Flight home on the 16th November (TOM 183) was much the same apart from plane was a bit grubby inside and the food was not as good as the outbound flight. Hats of to Thomson with the level of service on offer and a big thank you to the hard working cabin crew.

Thomson 787 Dreamliner. Economy Club. Good legroom - no need to pay more unless you're really tall 6'2" plus. OK cabin Service. Utterly rubbish seatback av system. Sound extremely poor meant TV was unviewable. Games not as good as before. Far worse than their 30 year old B767 kit. Problem observed on 2 aircraft and 2 different seat on each with selection of headphones.

Flew out to Montego Bay on the Dreamliner from Manchester and flew back on the normal old Thomson/First Choice aircraft. We upgraded to premium which wasn't cheap and the standard on the Dreamliner was average. The seat in front was dirty with splattered food there was residue of the previous persons meal left on my seat and the leather was already starting to wear! Seen as this is a new aircraft its becoming tatty and dirty already! As for the flight back the premium economy was filthy! The seats were broken TV screen scratched windows scratched. The food quality on both trips was just average at best. Yes you get extra leg room but in all honesty either pay a little extra and fly with Virgin premium or save your money and fly standard because this is not It premium economy! Also the organisation was terrible of people coming through the premium cabin to get to their seats in standard and the staff looked like they didn't want to be there!

Flew TOM 024 from Gatwick to Montego Bay in August. The flight to Montego Bay was delayed we were not even offered anything to drink on boarding the flight. I got a little container of water to drink after 2.5 hours. The food was of poor quality and it quickly became obvious that snacks were for sale! On the day of the return flight my friend and I missed our flight back as flight was delayed no announcements made either via intercom or on overhead monitors. We were actually waiting in the airport on time for the scheduled flight but no boarding call was made for us. Never again will I fly Thomson.

We flew from Tenerife to Glasgow on 2nd November on a Boeing 757-200. We left on-time and arrived early. Check-in was chaotic only 3 desks open for two full flights with us being told that this was because the handler (Iberia) opened the desks 15mins late for the first flight which caused a knock-on effect. We arrived 30mins before check- in opened but still queued for 50 mins. By the time we got through security etc we had about 10mins before boarding. As folk were still checking-in people were boarding the plane in dribs and drabs. Basically not enough desks open. We had extra leg-room seats booked by the emergency exit which were perfect! Plane was one of Thomson's older ones and was showing its age a bit. Luggage allowance with Thomson (and Thomas Cook) is miserable 25kg combined compared to Jet2 who offer 32kg.

Inbound flight from Tunisia (TOM 857) at check-in we were told that the family would need to be split up (2 daughters aged 7 and 3) because we did not pre-book seats. We raised our concerns at the time but told to speak to attendants when boarding. Spoke to the attendants told not their problem and to speak to flight cabin crew when on the plane. Explained to the cabin crew our concerns again told it is our fault that we did not pre-book. As my 3 year old would not sit by herself (understandably) the cabin crew made two passengers (who had paid for their seats) to move out of their seat to accommodate my wife and 3 year old. They did this by 'threatening' the passengers that if they did not move they would delay the flight from leaving. Luckily the couple were very kind and obliged. When I spoke to the attendant his behaviour was rude and arrogant again blaming my family for not booking the seats in advance. Even though outbound we were allocated seats together as legal requirement for children to sit with parents. Thomson staff completely ignored our concerns. I will never book or fly with Thomson again. Do they really expect a 7 and 3 year old to sit next to strangers on a flight. They knew we were passengers as a family so why did they allow this to happen?

Flew on Dreamliner or should that be nightmare liner from Birmingham to Cancun on 11 October. Flight slightly delayed due to all toilets being out of action took off with 1 toilet out of order coped with that but food on both inbound and outbound was disgusting crew indifferent. Delayed on return from Cancun on October 25th check in computers went 'down' with 75 of us still waiting to check in. We were left standing for 2 hrs while they tried to sort out problem despite asking for info numerous times we were treated with utter contempt telling me personally to get back in the queue when I asked why we couldn't be checked in manually? The staff offered no explanation as to when we could board the pilot knew of the problem because when he & the crew checked in we had already been waiting for an hour. The staff were a disgrace and Thomson should look into their customer service approach. Eventually we checked in with minutes to spare and straight onto the plane no duty free shopping for us unfortunate 75 customers. The flight home didn't have enough duty free purchases the food was awful as stated & the mood lighting? What mood lighting? No apology from the pilot just a cursory sorry for the delay due to technical problems! I wasn't aware I was a technical problem just another upset customer left in limbo for 2 hrs with rude staff. On arriving at Birmingham we couldn't lock up with the departure tunnel & it had to be relocated to another door more delays. On leaving aircraft my husband said to 1 of crew 'we had trouble getting on plane and trouble getting off' his reply was 'just one of those things liking having problems with a new car'! If I had a new car with that many problems I'd be furious and staff who don't give a monkeys only added to the problem on a lighter note the plane did have better leg room and more choice of movies but apart from that no better than any other Thomson flight and I've been on plenty.

Flew out of Birmingham airport to Sanford Orlando on 12th October 2014 on the Dreamliner. Fantastic flight out crew lovely and we had no problems. Check in and flight on time. Good inflight entertainment. We are a family of two adults and two children ages 9 and 7. the kids didn't like their meals but ours was ok. We were sat in rows 15 and 16 in economy and the legroom was really good. Could not fault the flight out at all. The return journey on 26th October was not quite so good. Ground staff at Sanford airport at check-in were slow probably not their fault as only 4 check-in positions open. Flight boarded on time. We were informed when we boarded that a member of crew was absent due to sickness so we would have to be aware that some services might be delayed. Fair enough sickness happens. However the cabin crew appeared miserable no smiles and food was just thrown on our trays in front of us. It felt as though they just wanted to get the services done and dusted ASAP. My youngest daughter was airsick twice on return journey - my husband went to get a member of staff and was just handed a load of tissues and a half a glass of water. He was told that someone would be along shortly they never turned up. Disgusting service on way back. Such a shame as outward journey and staff brilliant. As far as the Dreamliner goes fantastic plane.

TOM 058 to Mauritius on 21st September. Having flown Premium Economy on BA and Virgin many times to Caribbean this flight in Premium club was outstanding. From service to food to comfort to entertainment I could not fault it. Its a pity Thomson's don't add more destinations. My only gripe was the design of the centre console housing the TV screen made getting in and out of seat tricky but I believe this is being addressed. On landing no jet lag - excellent.

### Thomson Airways customer review
Have just flown on new 787 Dreamliner premium so this is what 1st class must be like on BA and Virgin. It is far better than the cabin class on both these airlines and worth every penny of the extra if you can even the food was good and hot.

Flew on Thomsons 787 Dreamliner on 27 Sept to Cancun returning 11 Oct. The plane was called Angel of the Skies and it was filthy. If you are sitting at the window take a look up at the vents above the window and you will see they are caked in dirt. Seats are too narrow making eating awkward. Not that you would want to eat anything. The oriental sweet soy chicken was inedible.

Flew on the B787 from Gatwick to Cancun 28/09/14. We pre booked our seats prior to travelling which is something I would highly recommend (although they do charge) as I saw that many couples and families were separated. Both flights were on time and were shorter flying time than past flights to Mexico. The staff were generally good outbound and the food was warm and of a reasonable standard. Drinks were regularly offered (although they are expensive). Entertainment was good outbound. Inbound flight was a little different - as soon as we got onboard we were told that the entertainment system in the rear of the plane seats 30 and up was not working. Staff and pilot apologised and stated that staff were looking to reset the system. I did not work for the first 2 hours and so were offered a complimentary drink. The cabin crew were fantastic and they apologised personally for the inconvenience. Speaking to the cabin crew they stated that this particular aircraft has a fault with the entertainment system. They told us that they had reported it for months but Thomson were not doing anything about it. After just over two hours the system worked for the remainder of the flight but given the plane is brand new and that Thomson make such a big deal about the 787 you'd have thought they would want the planes to be working perfectly. I am happy to pay a premium to know that I am flying on a brand new plane with better facilities particularly long haul. Inbound the food was good staff excellent and the pilot gave regular updates. Overall a good experience on the 787 but Thomson need to sort the fault out on the entertainment system.

### Thomson Airways customer review
Poor experience. Paid extra to go on the new Dreamliner to the USA went to choose seats a week out and site was "down" and said seats would be allocated at the airport. When we got to airport it was apparent why. The Dreamliner had technical "last minute" difficulties and had been replaced with an old 767. Wrote in to complain as we could have purchased a similar experience with other providers and they basically said "tough". They shouldn't promote the new Dreamliner at additional cost then change for an inferior plane.

### Thomson Airways customer review
We booked our holiday so my husband could travel on the Dreamliner arrived at airport to be told we wouldn't be on this aircraft. On our return flight we did travel on the Dreamliner unfortunately my seat was stuck in the upright position for the whole journey from Mexico to Manchester. I reported this to the stewardess who apologised and explained there were no other seats available and she would log the fault. When we returned home and wrote to Thomson who explained there was no record of the seat problem and asked if we had any photographs which we didn't. From what our letter suggests do not accept that the stewardess will log problems make sure you take all necessary copies and photographic evidence.

We flew from Manchester to the Algarve on 9/10/14 and what a dismal experience. After arriving just over two hours before the flight at the supposedly quick 'bag drop' desk we queued one and a half hours to be then rushed through security by a surly rude member of staff. No time to browse duty free or anything else. Had to board straight away on what was a dirty and tired looking plane. Only one member of the cabin crew was what you would expect as being helpful the remainder were not. Will not be using Thomson again in the future was totally disappointed with entire process from start to finish of the flight side of our holiday.

4th Time flying with Thomson. Flew to Bodrum this time TOM266 outbound and TOM757 inbound. Both 757's each way outbound we had their oldest aircraft they have in their fleet G-BYAT was so nice to fly on her considering she's soon to go out of service! Inbound we had a newer 757 in better condition G-OOBN. Legroom on their aircraft's is acceptable and chair comfort is really good. Crew on the outbound were miserable I have to admit bar one who was pleasant. Inbound crew were fantastic and served with a smile. On the inbound flight we hit some bad turbulence however the captain calmed everyone down by giving us frequent updates.

Flew Gatwick to Palma on 11th November in one of their latest Boeing 737-800. Great flight no complaints. The only thing I would like to know is when Thomson hand luggage allowance will increase from a paltry 5kg to 10kg as other budget lines?

Flew from Gatwick to Sanford on the Dreamliner TOM 70 and TOM 71. Only positive things to say boarding prompt plane spotless on both legs. Regular updates from the pilot cabin crew friendly and attentive. Really impressed with the plane very quite and didn't seem to have any jet lag. The standard cabin for me was about the same standard as the premium on the 767 so was really happy with it and will be booking with Thomson next year.

### Thomson Airways customer review
Flew from Manchester to Paphos on a 737-800 both ways. Cabin crew were friendly and attentive. They do squeeze a lot of passengers in to these aircraft with very little leg room. The 737-800 had no standard seat pocket - only a magazine/safety instruction pocket at the top of the seatback in front so nowhere to store a book or anything else which is a very poor design. No inflight entertainment even although the flight time was almost 5 hours. Food and drinks available were standard airline snacks. Flight on time outbound and about 35 mins late on the return. Overall - not too bad despite being sent around at Manchester on the return leg because of an aircraft ahead having missed it's exit from the runway.

### Thomson Airways customer review
TOM058 to Mauritius from Gatwick on 14th September and back on 29th. I have to start by saying what a fantastic plane the Dreamliner was and Thomson yet again fulfilled all our expectations. From booking to notifications to checking in flight and hotel. Seat reservations is a bit of a task and resulted in us not getting any window seats but we know what to do now. The Dreamliner has some issues such as access for passengers sitting in the middle seats you have to put trays and TV screens away so they can get out and that was in Premium so assume it was worse for Economy. Plus the aisle arm rests are a bit dangerous and seem to work loose very easily which results in the table sometimes not reaching its rest on the opposite side as the armrest moves too much. But comfort noise (lack of) service and general feeling was a vast improvement. Lighting is great and facilities are brilliant with auto lights flush and hot water.

### Thomson Airways customer review
Gatwick to Antalya 2 September. One word to describe checking in process - shambles. Arrived with time to spare allegedly. Directed to end of a snaking queue which hardly moved. The reason for this became obvious when we came within sight of the desks and the realisation that just 2 were being used. By this time flights were starting to board and people were still in the queue. Now surely someone should realise that you don't solve problems by pulling people from same queue and using same check ins to get these people on their flights hadn't anyone thought through the process and realised that this just exacerbates the problem. Obviously not. So eventually nearly 2 hours later flight is imminent and there's eight of us plus golf clubs need I say more. So we check in and then have to take the clubs half way across the airport to leave them at the overweight area. Through security was efficient as usual this is nothing to do with the airline. One of our party has an ICD so cannot go through the metal detector thus causing not a great hold up but not quite as quick as the rest of us. Straight through to the gate where we were met with the comment - 'hurry up you're the last we've been waiting for you'. Once aboard and in the air the selling of the food and drink started. Felt sorry for cabin crew who took orders from passengers took the orders back came round with the trolley serving drinks served the drink and then had to go and collect any food required for each row of seats. How very time consuming add to that the fact that a lot of the time they did not seem to be aware if the food on offer was actually on the plane. Would say that the crew were very friendly and approachable despite all this. Has to be said that someone needs to look into the fact that not all check ins are straight forward and even after checking in some passengers will not be able to sprint through security. Staff are there to assist not pass comment about something that in this case was the entire fault of the airline. Finally what's the use of checking in online when no use of bag drop is made.

Return Manchester-Marrakech on B737-800 (14/08/2014-25/08/2014). Bag drop check in an absolute breeze outward flight on a slightly older aircraft but none the less it was comfortable on-time with polite and efficient cabin crew. Return flight on a new Dreamliner 737-800 with a modern comfortable and airy interior. Seat comfort was excellent and the cabin crew were friendly efficient and personable even after dealing admirably with an inconsiderate family who boarded the plane late and then expected passengers to move to sit together. Buy on board products work well. Overall a good experience.

I flew from Gatwick to Paphos on a 757-200 and from Paphos to Gatwick on a 737-800. Both flights were excellent the seats were very comfortable and there was excellent legroom. The cabin crew were extremely friendly and I thoroughly enjoyed the flight. I brought a cheese and ham Panini on board and thinking it would be horrible as most airline food is it was actually very tasty. The only moan was that we were delayed leaving Gatwick by 20 minutes but was because 5 people were late for the flight. Not at all Thomson's fault. Going from Paphos to Gatwick was on time. Both airports were great. Would recommend.

My friend took seriously ill on flight TOM2217 arriving in Manchester at 0140am on Wed 1st October. The whole staff and crew were absolutely wonderful in dealing with the awful situation. As well as arranging for my friend to be met by ambulance they helped his relative with the luggage. Their kindness was outstanding and will be always remembered. We can only say thank you so very much.

Flew to Cancun from Manchester. Good flight with no problems. Paid for extra leg room seats not much space between passengers. My boyfriend is 6'2" and he found it very small and had to change seats with me to the window seat for little bit of added space. Not worth paying the extra money for at all! On the flight back the staff looked like they couldn't be bothered and didn't even force a smile out. Food was thrown at us and everything was rushed. They had sold out of all duty free and there was no choice. If Thomson are bragging about how amazing this new Dreamliner is then you would expect better from it both staff and seating.

### Thomson Airways customer review
First time on the Dreamliner Premium Class nothing but praise. We went Gatwick to Sanford 17th September and returned 2nd October. Everything went smoothly no delays or hold ups our own check in and boarded and unboarded first. Little things but help when you have paid quite a lot extra to upgrade. Cabin crew on both legs were friendly and helpful food lovely (I am a vegetarian) plenty of drinks offered and entertainment was good. If possible I would only fly Premium Class again. I made sure we had row 1 loads of leg room seats also big and comfy.

### Thomson Airways customer review
We booked with Thomson in the Premium cabin hoping we would be on the new Dreamliner aircraft unfortunately this was not the case and we were on one of the 767 aircraft. What I didn't realize until on the day was that they are still using old First Choice 767 aircraft and when I say old I mean the Aircraft looks like it hasn't had an update since it rolled off the production line nearly 20 years ago. How they can call what that 767 offers as a premium cabin and charge a premium charge for it is beyond me. Looking at the economy cabin I struggled to see what the difference was minus free drinks and an amenity kit was this worth the substantial increase in cost over the economy cabin I fear not. The whole aircraft was incredibly dated dirty and rattled like an old bus this wasn't what I was expecting flying with a company such as Thomson. I understand they are in the process of updating their fleet with the new sought after 787 Dreamliner aircraft but I really can't understand how they can charge such an amount of money to fly in the Premium cabin of the 767's. Our seats looked like they came out of a 30 year old Jaguar and had such little padding in them that we had to buy a large pillow for our buttocks for the journey back. The meals served were awful I don't exactly expect fresh gourmet food on an aircraft but from all the literature I was certainly expecting better than what we were served with. That brings me on to the entertainment on board or lack of shall I say yes they have got individual monitors in the backs of the seats with a control but the quality of the screen was awful. Scratches and marks everywhere and the picture quality of a 90's TV set which I suppose ties in with the rest of the dated aircraft. The entertainment on board was also woeful I haven't seen such a lack of entertainment since we only had 4 terrestrial TV channels. We must have been spoiled going on Virgin Airways expecting quality entertainment with brand new films on board not titles from 5 years ago. I fear that it is not only the aircraft that has let down the Thomson name but also the service despite being in the Premium cabin we were consistently served last for all meals and drink rounds despite expecting a dedicated staff and the galley being just in front of the Premium cabin. Again not like we missed out on much from the quality of the food but we expect to at least be served first after paying the premium cost. Although there was priority boarding there certainly was not priority exiting of the aircraft. Overall we are severely unimpressed with our experience and with it being our first long haul flight with Thomson I am afraid that it will be our last. There is a certain level of quality value for money and service I expect when flying with an airline and I am afraid they have not delivered on this occasion and have pushed us back into the direction of Virgin Airways where we know exactly what to expect.

Where do I start? Fast bag drop off at Bournemouth what a joke same line for all so no time saved. The flight left on time and it was a very well organized and good flight. The return flight was interesting. It showed me why Thomson are good. There was a medical emergency 4 rows in front and the calmness and professional conduct of the crew was fantastic. The crew showed great compassion and comforted the patient and relatives.

Glasgow to Dalaman 22 Sept to 29 Sept return on a 757-200.The outbound flight's seating comfort for a four hour flight was extremely poor. I'm 5'10 not particularly tall but my knees were jammed up against the seat in front thankfully the woman sitting there didn't recline her seat or I would have been stuck. The return flight was better as it had Recaro seats where the seat pocket is missing giving more legroom which was more comfortable. It was a typical holiday charter flight full to capacity with the cabin crew working hard to sell drinks food and duty free throughout the flight. It got us there and back with the minimum of fuss but if you're over 5'8 just hope you have Recaro seating on the plane.

### Thomson Airways customer review
Flight to Sanford in premium seating even though Dreamliner was only one year old it had dirty seats and crumbs in crevices and overall looked like it hadn't been cleaned properly for a while. Shame as overall the Dreamliner comfort levels and room were great. Two man crew never smiled during service and didn't stop economy passengers using the premium toilets causing queues to form which shouldn't happen when paying additional £250 per person for the extra service.

Flight TOM 162/163 MAN-PVR-MAN outbound 11/09/2014 inbound 25/09/2014 on the Dreamliner. Both flights were good - the cabin crew were professional and cheerful on both flights. Had good seats in the premium cabin with plenty of leg room only one fault on the return journey was the table was too wide for the seat obviously original had been damaged. Only moan for the return flight was arriving back at Manchester 35 minutes early and then the plane was parked up for over an hour with engines running whilst Manchester Airport sorted themselves out. Captain was not happy. Had to deplane by steps and bussed to terminal - not a great end to what was a good holiday.

### Thomson Airways customer review
I felt a bit let down by this airline. We travelled as a couple long haul. We couldn't sit together on either leg of the trip as we didn't pay extra (£15 each each way) this was quite a big deal to us. There wasn't as much choice of movies/entertainment as the bigger airlines. Also the refreshments were pretty poor. There was only 2 complimentary coffees throughout the whole of the flight. Every other drink had to be paid for. Also I found it a bit cringey how they kept pointing out the different classes of the plane. For example telling economy customers not to pass the premium curtain under any circumstances or use their toilets. The seats are uncomfortable for long haul. The only benefit I found of the Dreamliner was the bigger windows.

Flight from Manchester to Cancun 8/9/14 - check in was quick and efficient and flight left on time. A man took seriously ill approx 3 hours into the flight and we were subsequently diverted to the Azure's. We were stuck on the plane for approx 2 hours whilst Thomson considered their options with the pilots offering little correspondence to the customers. We were finally told we would continue and under the circumstances the cabin crew performed extremely professionally. Return flight no problems the only issues we had with the Dreamliner are the air conditioning leaked water a few times onto my partner on both flights and my entertainment screen would not work. Would fly with Thomson again.

### Thomson Airways customer review
Flew from Manchester to cancun at beginning of Sep. Was first time flying on the Dreamliner and overall it was an excellent flight. Check in was quick at Manchester and we boarded on time and took of on time. Sat in premium club cabin and paid £400 per person (return) for the pleasure. First drinks service was out promptly and each had two vodkas from the bar along with bar nibbles. Then served inflight meal of Thai chicken which was delicious along with coffee and choice of baileys or brandy to accompany. Plenty of legroom and room to move around and entertainment systems was fab. Couple of hours later the 2nd bar service followed. Ordered vodka again only to be told they had completely ran out on the first bar service. So asked for a beer (again none left). Third choice was a magners (again none left as ran out on first drinks round) so had to settle for a cocktail. This left a sour taste as between the 4 of us we paid £1600 to upgrade to the premium club cabin only to be told on the 2nd drinks service that they had ran out of most things. If they are marketing themselves as a premium airline and charge premium prices for the seat upgrades then they seriously need to have a look at including a premium drinks service as it's completely unacceptable to be charging these prices to upgrade and not providing the service to match. I notice that from next year that economy passengers are having free drinks included. I wonder how they are going to manage to provide 300 plus passengers with free drinks if they can't deliver right now to 50 passengers at the front. I'd rate the Dreamliner aircraft and crew 10/10. Drinks choice in premium club 2/10.

Flew on the Dreamliner to Florida from Gatwick. Although these planes are quite new they already have a huge amount of wear and tear. The seats are wide but are uncomfortable on your legs after a nine hour flight and to get out of them when the seats in front are reclined you have to be a mountain goat. The arm rests could do with being about 2 inches shorter. The cabin crew out were average but the crew coming home made up for that they were excellent. Would I fly again - probably.

### Thomson Airways customer review
4 of us flew Glasgow to Sanford in Premium. Reading earlier reviews I was apprehensive as it has been a long time since I booked a holiday airline. Quite a surprise. 787 was great and the captain was obviously proud on the outbound flight going into some details about this particular aircraft. The cabin crew worked extremely hard constantly in the cabin with food snacks and drinks. Unlike other carriers the crew did not vanish. Movie choice was good for the duration of the flight. Same high quality experience on the flight home. Sanford airport is very small but the benefits are obvious and on a holiday worth the trade off for expanded facilities. I would not hesitate to book with Thomson on this route/holiday again.

### Thomson Airways customer review
How can an airline who sells a premium service that says it includes a choice of meal fail to be able to offer the choice of meal? On our flight the stewardess came around asking what meal people wanted but by the time she got to the last 20 or so people there was only one option left! The poor stewardess told us this was a common event on return trips and head office just do not seem to want to address the problem. Shame as the service from the crew was very good but they are being let down by this problem. Also how badly designed are the Dreamliner seats. You need to be a four foot limbo dancer to be able to exit during the flight.

### Thomson Airways customer review
Poor quality service from this aspect of our First Choice holiday. Overcharged for baggage allowance and First Choice has failed to respond to the complaint. The staff at Rhodes failed to provide any information re flight delay and customer service best described as sullen. The so called budget airlines provide better service.

Dreamliner passengers avoid seat 26C with all your might. It's adjacent to the toilets which is ok but everyone who passes this seat or waits there will lean on your seat back or whack it as they pass thump it with the food trolley the duty free trolley the snack trolley and anything else they can think of. There is no cabin wall at the rear of this seat. It is also conveniently furnished in black unlike every other seat which is a light grey so you can forgive passengers for not seeing it. This wears very thin on an 8/9 hour flight. It also doesn't help when some members of the crew are miserable as sin and don't even apologise to the row in front who got quite a down poor from 'condensation' as we took off. No understanding in her comments at all just a robotic response even dismissive and quite rude to the point of why are you even mentioning it. Poor sight lines to cabin safety demo and I'm quite tall and saw very little through the heads of people leaning into the aisle to watch. Good seat pitch though not quite as good as Emirates but a lot better on a medium haul flight.

I flew Manchester to Sanford with Thomson on TOM144 outbound (August 23rd) and TOM155 inbound (September 6th). Both flights were on the Dreamliner. We were impressed from the outset. Bag drop and security were quick and efficient and the flight boarded on time and took off on time. We were pleasantly surprised when the captain announced that the flight would take only 8 hours! The crew were fantastic the flight smooth and hardly any turbulence other than having the seatbelt signs on for ten minutes just prior to entering the Florida area due to some clear-air turbulence though it was something and nothing. The inflight entertainment kept me my hubby and two daughters aged 10 and 12 occupied throughout without any boredom and the flight passed by quickly. On the return flight we again took off on time from a small and basic Sanford and the flight time was 7.5 hours. Again very smooth flight and efficient crew (except for one rather cheeky announcement from the head stewardess about adults not setting an example to their kids by standing when the seatbelt signs were still illuminated after landing) She had a fair point but made in in rather the wrong way! The only real problem was unavoidable we had to make a go around on landing (on time) at Manchester due to low mist on the runway which the captain kept us well informed about which resulted in sitting on the tarmac for fifteen minutes as by the time another plane was in our gate but this was a minor hitch rather a go around than a dangerous landing! All in all a very enjoyable experience and everyone I know who has travelled Dreamliner has been very taken by it and I would most definitely fly on it again in the future.

Is it reasonable to expect that if you pay many thousands of pounds to take your family for a special occasion to Orlando you would assume that Thomson would help you have great time right from the outset? We are a group of six adults in three pairs due to travel on Saturday. When you buy a holiday you are asked whether you want to pay extra to ensure that you can sit together. However for me that equates to an extra £180. I assumed that if we didn't take the option at least the airline would try to sit us in pairs as I never expected to be six together. On flights with other airlines it has never been an issue. Always together on long haul. The other day I looked at our allocation and to my disgust we had all been split up. I went to Thomson because many of the unallocated seats were in better combination positions that we had allocated. No joy from Thomson unless I was willing to pay for change of seats even if no one had been allocated to them. They advised me to phone Thomson which I did. Again absolute stone wall response. I was told that because a computer had made the allocations that was final. I couldn't change to spare seats without paying even though no one had been allocated to them. I was told that buying a flight only entitled me a seat on the plane. Not a seat with a fellow passenger. So I asked "on a long haul flight where I have three pairs of passengers nothing can be done to change our seating arrangements to spare seats without me paying". No" they replied. In one swoop it confirms that because computer says no Thomsons claim that where possible they will seat passengers from the same group together is absolute rubbish. It is all about money grabbing. I can understand it if I was popping across the channel but an 8 hour long haul. It makes a complete mockery of having a system where you can just buy a holiday with an expectation that you will sit next to your partner. Flying Sat 13/9 to Orlando from Gatwick.

EMA to Madeira. August 2014. Positives: Both flights departed and arrived on time. Both planes new. Negatives: Seating - cramped / uncomfortable. I'm 5ft 10 so not overly tall but 3.5/4 hours really is the limit. Food: You book a five star hotel but the experience on board is far from five star why on a 4 hour flight can we no longer order / pay for a proper meal? Being offered chips at 7am just doesn't work in my opinion / neither does a Kit Kat. East Midlands airport is an absolute joke and by the time you've 'dropped your bags off' and cleared security you have no time to buy something half decent to eat for the flight. Crew were OK. Miserable on the outward flight and to be honest they looked liked they'd had a rough night previous. Thomson flights aren't cheap but the level of service doesn't reflect this. I've booked this trip for my family independently for next year and booked TAP flights to Madeira. Just a note: why do people feel the need to say how bumpy their flight was? This isn't controlled by the airline and shouldn't be mentioned to quantify how well the airline performed on a particular trip!

Gatwick to Sanford Florida 25th July 2014. Dreamliner 787 Boeing. 5 Adults 2 children. Check in quick. Slight delay - half an hour. Good flight smooth. Economy seats pre-booked together 3 in the middle and 2 adults either side at the very rear of the plane. Good leg room. good pitch no one behind the two seats each side. Mood lighting good. Window blinds are good with less noise from engines. The children's meals were passed out first which was good. Meals not the best. Service not bad. The female crew members could have been a lot more pleasant. All in all I would fly with Thomson again.

We flew from Dalaman Turkey on Monday 8th Sep. We were 25 mins from Luton the pilot told us there was a security problem at Luton airport. They had evacuated the airport. He told us we were diverting to Stansted and there would be buses to take us to Luton. There were 20 other planes diverted to Stansted at the same time when we got through customs we waited 2 mins and a message came over the tanoy that our busses were waiting for us. 90 minuets later we were in our cars on the way home.

Dreamliner. Flew to Cancun on 21 August 2014. The aircraft itself is ok. Food is disgusting and no choice. You have to pay if you want a drink with your meal! How ridiculous! Toilets were filthy. On the inbound journey water from the lockers above poured over me. We had to beg for headphones. One female member of staff was quite rude. Never ever again will I go with Thomson.

Birmingham to Orlando on Sunday 17 August. Excellent flight on a new Dreamliner. Plenty of leg room comfortable seats and attentive cabin crew. Pushed back 10 minutes early and kept updated by the captain. Food and drinks good. Return flight on Sunday 31 August. What a difference! We arrived at the airport to be told the return flight would be on a 767 not a Dreamliner disappointed but not big problem. On board the Captain had a rant amongst the things he said was "its not my fault that we are not flying the Dreamliner and its not the fault of the cabin crew so I expect you to treat them with respect". It seems the crew were rostered at short notice and what a miserable lot they were. One female member banged into me every time she walked up and down the aisle without once apologising. After dinner an announcement was made that if you wanted anything else you were to come to the galley for service. The curtains were drawn and the cabin crew were not seen again for several hours. Having crossed the Atlantic at least 20 times I have never heard such announcements. The seats on 767s are very hard and the leg room minimal. I conclusion 10/10 for the outbound flight 3/10 for the return flight.

TOM126 and TOM127. Over 5 hour delay at Manchester to Sanford Orlando no information given at gate £5.00 meal voucher given after 3 hours didn't cover cost of sandwich and coffee on return from Sanford 2 weeks later no Dreamliner everyone in small seats TV screens not working my seat covered in crumbs and an hour late into Manchester. Thomson at its best.

LGW-REUS-LGW. We flew with our 2 grandchildren last month. Check in was relatively easy and we were airside in approx 25 minutes. Boarding was OK although there was some confusion with the wrong passengers sitting in the emergency exit seats which caused a delay and resulted in the pilot saying unless it was sorted out in 2 minutes we would miss our slot and would incur a 2 hour delay. This did the trick and after a rapid push back and taxi we were airborne very quickly albeit 25 minutes late. The flight was uneventful although quite noisy with happy families and kids looking forward to their holidays. The return flight was the same although we departed and arrived bang on time. Overall good holiday flights with friendly and efficient cabin crews and as a result I would have no hesitation in recommending Thomson Airlines.

Flew from Gatwick to Antalya on 22 August with return on 2 September. Bag drop took over an hour from 7.30am in the morning. There was no management organising the long queues and with one side overflowing we were sent to the opposite side which was a shorter queue. However the side we were told to queue in only had two people working on the 15 desks. At 8am one left leaving everyone frustrated. The flight was delayed by an hour. On arrival in Antalya the plane parked up in the middle of the airfield so we had bus transfers. Our luggage took over an hour to arrive from the plane. Another 4 planes arrived after us and they all left the baggage reclaim area before us. I appreciate that this is not the fault of the airline however I am sure that the lack service provided to them is reflected by how the airline is viewed by Antalya Airport. The return flight was only 45 minutes late leaving. The aircraft for flight TOM707 must have been one of the oldest planes I have ever been on. At take off I had water dripping down on me we were sitting in row 12 and 13 by the exit door. If you touched the door it was like an ice block. My daughter asked about a blanket and had to buy one for £5. When we landed at Gatwick at 2.15 in the morning the plane was parked so far from the main terminal building it must have been over a mile walk. One last thing to mention; why do Thomson ask you to check in online and print off your boarding pass? At Gatwick and Antalya they just ripped them up and issued a boarding card!

Mon 25 Aug Leeds/Bradford to Corfu. What a disaster. Supposed to fly 22.15 processed through passport control - 10 mins later flight delayed then back out again. Waiting in arrivals (no seats) and no information either. Flight cancelled to 11.15 following day. 1.45 coaches come to take us to hotels. 50 fellow travellers on coach outside IBIS in Saltaire Shipley only 4 rooms. Got back to airport Tuesday 26th flight delayed again. A complete disaster and every single passenger was up in arms. Flight supposed to have been cancelled for bad weather but we couldn't understand why other flights were arriving and departing turned out it was a medical emergency diverted to Manchester. I understand these thing happen but why lie about it. Never again will I use Thomson.

Flew Premium LGW to Orlando Sanford and return August 2014. Flight out was excellent - everyone was wide awake and excited seats were comfy and managed to snooze. Food was good and drinks service was regular - very attentive and pleasurable cabin crew. Slightly frustrated that leaving the cabin was a free for all with economy but I expect that is because I am used to premium classes being given priority with BA and Virgin. Flight back was a completely different experience - cabin crew were okay and worked hard with what they had but that was the issue - no drinks no snacks no nothing - choice was full fat pepsi or water for the kids everything else had been used on the flight out - no crisps nothing. Food was very poor and the breakfast inedible. Probably the most frustrating things was the seats - you just could not get comfortable to sleep at all and the arm rests between the seats are so poorly designed that you could not move or get in or out. Dreamliner lighting not used properly which was a shame. So close to being a good product but for the price it will be BA or Virgin in the future.

Flew to Cancun on 5th August TOM28. There were 3 of us 2 adults and one 7 year old. Having missed out on a holiday in 2013 we decided to treat ourselves and upgrade to Premium. I cannot fault the outbound flight. Priority check-in with separate baggage check-in and separate security passport control all taking no more than ten minutes or so. Staff - friendly and attentive got customer care spot on. Came round with drinks trolley numerous times. They were happy to make conversation and made a fuss of the kids. Food was good with a very good choice - sparkling wine or orange juice was offered pre-flight which was a lovely touch. Separate meals for the kids. Snacks offered with drinks and some small chocolate bars offered. The individual mini desserts were particularly good and the inclusion of an afternoon tea prior to landing was again well thought out. The plane: Nice wide leather seats with moveable head rests lots of leg room with pop up leg rest blankets pillows and a travel bag with toothbrush eye patches ear defenders all a nice touch. The actual plane noise was minimal with auto dimming on the windows. Inflight entertainment: Good selection of movies for adults and kids nice quality headphones handed out once seated there were also music channels some interactive games and some drama and comedy channels a pretty good selection with some quite new films. Now the bad the return. 19 Aug TOM 29. We were so disappointed after having a fantastic family holiday no welcome onboard. All extras that had been handed out to us on the inbound flight - head phones etc were just thrown on your seat The three women and one guy barely managed a smile let alone spoke to customers. I was reading my magazine and I had a menu thrust over the top. Food trays were whisked away swiftly. The main meal was a poor reflection on the outbound meal. Main course was as uninteresting the dessert was written on the menu as a chocolate indulgence - well it was one squirt of vanilla whip and one chocolate whip on a piece of sponge. Drinks offered with meals. We did not see the waiting staff for about 6 hours as they eventually pulled their curtains and were not seen till breakfast not even to check everyone was ok or offer water etc. There were supposed to be two different inflight entertainment menus one outgoing one return. Well we had exactly the same films and offer on both journeys.

Flew Gatwick - Cephalonia and return in Economy. Both times there were no delays departing or arriving and throughout both flights there was never any turbulence and the seat belt sign never went on (apart from obviously take off and landing). However the planes (737-800) were dirty and the leg room was awful. The crew although friendly spent most of the time trying to sell you stuff including their ridiculously overpriced tiny portions of food. We checked in on line for both flights and used back drop at Gatwick but they didn't offer this at Cephalonia so we had to wait in the same queue as people checking in to be served by the same rather unfriendly check in person. Toilets existed but were very small and dirty by the end of the flight.

Travelled from Gatwick to Dalaman on 11th August 2014 flight number TOM862 with Thomson Airways on a 767-300 flight there and back on time crew very polite and flight deck crew kept us up to date. No issues with Thomson Airways will travel with them again. Inflight Entertainment would be nice on a 4 hour flight.

Nothing but good things to say about Thomson. Flew to Puerto Vallarta on August 14th on G-TUIE and my flight couldn't have been more enjoyable. The crew were friendly the meals were great and the seats were roomy and comfortable. The crew kept my champagne on ice until we were ready for it with fresh Orange juice on the house in case we wanted to make Bucks Fizz. Snacks were handed out at various points in the journey and we arrived in Puerto Vallarta feeling surprisingly fresh for an 11 hour journey. On the return journey airport reps were helpful and friendly and the cabin crew were as friendly as always. After arrival back in Manchester the two captains and first officer were happy for me to join them in the cockpit for some photographs and a brief chat about the aircraft. My only slight criticism about the 787 is that the entertainment system seems particularly prone to crashing and freezing up but the crew were happy to reset it for me and provided a free beverage when they weren't able to immediately rectify it. This happened on both G-TUIE and G-TUIF but these teething troubles will disappear over time I should imagine.

We flew in premium on Dreamliner from Manchester to Sanford on 2nd Sep 2013 and returned 16th Sep 2013. We paid £ £800 each and can honestly say was worth every penny we had big leather seats plenty of width and great legroom. The service of staff was excellent. The aircraft was lovely and very quiet. We have flown premium on many other airlines and Thomson Dreamliner beats them all. We are flying to Orlando Sanford on Thomson Dreamliner in premium cabin again on 5th Sep 2014.

Went on the Dreamliner on 30th July after being told they had no headsets for the inflight entertainment and after that screens didn't work anyway! Nothing offered to us for over an hour on the flight! Then after over 3.5 hours of flying the pilot announced he was turning back to Manchester England because of a fault with the plane! Landed at Manchester only to wait over an hour and nobody telling us what was happening! Wasn't happy! Missed a days holiday because of this.

TOM 144 and 145 from Manchester to Sanford Orlando FLA Aug 2-16. Both ways were trouble-free clean surroundings good food and friendly crews. Coming back took less time of course due to tailwind. Staff were attentive and alert but much better banter on return. The seats were slightly cramped for my liking and I would have traded my TV screen for a footrest in front to take pressure off the top of my legs as I'm 5.3 but there was still more room than some airlines I've been on. I enjoyed both flights no delays or problems going a slight delay on return by 15 minutes due to ill crew member but provisions speedily made and we made up the time getting home and landed practically on time in Manchester. Take off and landing were smooth and the plane had very little turbulence both ways. Baggage was handled speedily for us with no case problems. The flight entertainment was plentiful with music TV and films available to select. Food in Economy was as good as it can get on any flight that doesn't have a built-in restaurant. Drinks and trolley food a bit expensive but main meals and snacks that came round I found to be quite tasty and varied but I'm not hard to please with food. I've read several reviews here and it seems as if we hit a lucky window with the best journey and staff at the time! But it does happen obviously. I can honestly say everything was great. Would I fly again? Well I'm not a long-haul flyer by nature so it's unlikely but I'd have no reservations about re-booking a Dreamliner with Thomson if I were.

### Thomson Airways customer review
Just travelled from Newcastle to Sanford with Thomson on the Dreamliner and experience was mixed. Plane was spacious clean and comfortable which was exactly what was promised. Cabin and flight crew on the way out were friendly helpful and informative with a very smooth flight and as a nervous flyer this was a great start to the holiday. The only downside was that 2 of the 5 entertainment systems did not work which made it difficult to entertain 3 excited children. The crew were clearly harassed as this appeared to the case across the plane and despite numerous attempts to reset the system our TVs did not co-operate. I have contacted Thomson to complain but no response to date. The return flight was a different experience we heard from the flight crew at the start and end of the journey but despite constant turbulence throughout the majority of the flight and the seatbelt sign being on there was deafening silence from the flight crew. This caused additional anxiety as it would only have taken a moment for someone to say don't worry this is normal. The flight crew were pleasant and efficient rather than friendly which was a marked difference from the crew going out. Despite a tailwind of over 150 mph for a large portion of the flight we were slightly delayed but overall the Dreamliner lived up to expectations.

Flew from Gatwick to Puerto Plata (TOM096) on 3/8/2014 on the "Dreamliner" more like nightmare liner. Plane was dirty with water dripping onto my friend food disgusting was supposed to be some kind of chicken and pasta in a tomato sauce was so dry and hard I think we were all served food left over from the week before. Staff well all I will say is if you hate your job that much then do something else. Pilot unable to land first time lots of panicking going on but not one word from pilot or flight attendants to let us know what was going on (quick message after from the "spare pilot" (yes that was his words). Return flight (TOM097) on 17/8/2014 was a completely different experience clean plane friendly happy flight staff and edible food. Please be aware you are offered no tea or coffee refills so the only free drinks you get are the ones you get with your meal. we travelled economy class and the seating is more spacious than normal.

Flight from Nottingham East Midlands to Cancun on 30th July 2014 aircraft type - 787 Dreamliner. Took off 40 min late due to issues with catering and inflight entertainment. Inflight entertainment intermittent and then reduced capability. At 3 hours out (Mid Atlantic) pilot announces technical issue with aircraft problem with hydraulics and that we need to return to Manchester to have replacement parts fitted. Upon arrival no crew available to enable replacement aircraft to be used. We ended up in a local hotel overnight with a replacement flight on an old 767 at 09:30 next morning. Eventually arrived almost 23 hours late great start to a much needed holiday! I understand that technical issues do occur but the turn back apperars to have been solely based on a commercial decision by TUI to avoid having an aircraft on ground in Cancun. 787 is a great aircraft when it works however there are too many problems with it currently. Avoid until fixed properly.

Travelled to Cancun from Gatwick on 1st August and returned 11th August. Both ways on the Dreamliner. Flew out on G-TUIE on the way there. On the way back we were on Dream Maker (G-TUIC). Premium is not worth the hike in price. We were sat 2 rows behind premium both ways in economy in extra space seats and they were just as good. I guess premium gets better cutlery and dishes slightly larger TV screen but that's it. The flights themselves were fantastic so smooth. The inflight entertainment was great wide variety of choice along with games too. Tip for people who want to sleep it wasn't until we landed coming back that we realised you could bend the headrest round your head! Might've helped if the cabin crew make everyone aware of what does what when they're sat down. I ended up with such a crick in my neck from sleeping in an awkward position with the unfluffiest pillow. Food going to Cancun was great. The Lily Obrien salted caramel chocolate mousse was to die for! And then to have 'afternoon tea' shortly before landing was a nice touch. Coming back was a different story. The food was mainly dry the bread roll was stale and like cardboard the dessert looked and tasted very artificial. Considering the flight back is almost 9 hours long there was a gap of 6 odd hours where the cabin crew didn't bother coming up and down the aisles anymore to see if anyone wanted anything. We had dinner shortly after take off and then an hour before landing we were served breakfast. I guess because it's a night flight they don't want to be disturbing people however I was so hungry! Guess I could've called them but they seem quite unapproachable. I'm a lover of Starbucks coffee so to see this on the menu was great. The pilots were great at keeping us informed.

Travelled to Corfu from Gatwick with Thomson bag drop had a queue so long it took us an hour and a half to drop bags plane was not the cleanest in the world. Landed at Corfu then had to queue outside on Tarmac for nearly an hour in 30 heat until doors were opened felt sick from aviation fuel smells cruise was excellent. Return to Gatwick queued outside terminal for an hour and half as had 6 flights and 3 check in staff then flight delayed so waited in packed terminal with no air con - was 34 degrees. Plane was late so to save time they didn't really clean it no food available on flight. Last time we use Thomson they charge for everything but service is so bad.

Flew from Tenerife South to Gatwick on the 8/8/16 and found that most of the flight attendants were really unhelpful. Most were just concentrating on selling duty free items and snacks. No inflight entertainment at all during the 4 1/4 hrs flight my 2 kids were really bored.

Flight from Birmingham to Cancun on Dreamliner. The most uncomfortable flight myself and wife have ever been on. My wife being under 5feet ended up with a bad neck due to the poor seat design and swollen feet as the edge of the seat cut off the blood supply. A foot rest would have prevented this. The food was the worst ever any on the return flight was inedible.

TOM144 and TOM145 Manchester to Orlando Sanford. After booking many holidays with Thomsons I have to say this is the last. Booked with the promise of Dreamliner both ways never got it due to technical issues!

I will avoid Thomson's at all costs charge the earth and don't deliver on promises.

We travelled to Cape Verde on 28th July 2014. Thomson's desks were chaotic. We printed out e-tickets and boarding passes online but this was a waste of time because we had to queue for 2.5 hours to "drop" our bags off. All different destinations went through the desks. Total Chaos. We had to go straight to boarding gate and only just made it. We had hoped to relax before the flight do a little last minute shopping - have a cooked breakfast etc. But instead we had to dash to the departure gate. What is the point of checking in online and having your boarding passes already printed? Those people who had not checked in on line or printed their boarding passes queued with everyone else.

Flew Dreamliner to Orlando 25th July  took over 1 hour to drop our bags off after checking in online. Departed 1 hour late after sitting on plane with no explanation why arrived in Florida in thunder storm so pilot aborted landing and circled airport for 1/2 hour before saying we needed to divert to another airport because we were low on fuel. Landed at nearby airport then sat on plane for 2 hours waiting for fuel then took off again for 1/2 hour flight back to Sanford airport 13.5 hours in total! TV entertainment onboard very poor compared to Virgin food and drinks service poor. Sat for 2 hours waiting for refuel not offered a drink. Return flight told we had been downgraded. Small seat no leg room very poor recline on seats - wouldn't like to fly much longer then 4 hours on this plane never mind back through night from Florida. Entertainment - TV very poor and food poor.

Flew to Antalya from Gatwick on 18th July. Out going flight was ok despite no inflight entertainment and overpriced average quality food. We experienced a huge amount of turbulence - no reassuring words from the flight crew as to what was going on. Very disappointing return flight which was at tea time. We were all very hungry and had not eaten at Antalya Airport due to the horrendous prices. We sat in the middle of the plane (rows 24 and 25) and they ran out of food before they got to us! In fact they had run out of food after the first five rows. All they could offer us was basically junk so we feasted on chocolate and kettle crisps. Not good enough on nearly a four hour flight - we were told this is typical on return flights. Shame on you Thomson I will not fly with you again if I can help it.

Manchester to Punta Cana to Manchester TOM 172 and TOM 173 23rd July 2014 6th August 2014. We booked premium seats. We checked in the night before and dropped off luggage. In the morning we went through to security. No problems. Boarding was slightly delayed as they changed a part. On board the staff were very good and kept the refreshments coming with no isses. Service was quick and friendly. Going back the flight was delayed an hour. But nothing major. Again a good and friendly flight home. The seats were nice. I just wish that they reclined more. The entertainment system was good with lots of choice. Overall we were happy with our flights.

Flew to Orlando Florida with my daughter and family. Arrived at airport 3.5 hours before flight and joined a long queue all waiting to check in even though we had checked in online the day before. Stood in queue for over an hour before being told that there was a computer failure and we had to wait for outside company to arrive to take over checking us in. Flight was then delayed for over 3 hours. Eventually boarded plane only to sit there another hour whilst we waited for paperwork and push off. All we got was a £3 voucher to spend on plane. Also booked with promise of flight on Dreamliner but got some very old tatty plane. Good holiday but then to travelling home. Received message from Thomson on morning of departure to be told that flight was delayed but to go to airport at normal time. Arrived at 2.30pm for 5.20 departure to find our flight time was now 9.40pm. We were given a $8 voucher to spend on refreshments. When we got to departure lounge we found that the restaurant was closed for the day and all that was open was duty free newsagents and sports bar. Only place accepted voucher was sports bar and food cost a lot more than $8. Finally boarded plane at 10pm and only consolation was it was the Dreamliner. We got served our dinner just after 11pm which was a long time since our breakfast at 9 am and then we did not see any crew member until breakfast was served at 8.30 next morning. Would I fly to Florida with Thomson again.

From Palma to Bristol on 3rd August 2014. Arrived at airport at 11.30pm for a 00.20 gate to find long check in queues. Thomson arranged the coach to the airport so not our fault cutting it fine. Only 4 check ins available and absolutely no advantage in using Bag drop as this was slower than normal check-in. Panic amongst Thomson staff finally set in and 2 more desks were opened to move the 200 people who were waiting to check-in. Long queue for security who were so rushed you could have taken anything on board. Got to gate at 00.30 to find the plane was not ready.

Flew from Birmingham on a very old 757 which had seen better days very tired interior and dirty was supposed to take off at 6pm we all boarded on time and seemed ready to go when it got to 6.30pm I realised there was a problem captain came on and said he was sorry for the late departure but due to heavy traffic in and around Birmingham we had to wait for the head cabin crew member to arrive funny how over 200 people made it on time but the crew couldn't wonder if they would have held the plane if passenger was stuck in traffic... I think not. When she arrived she strolled on and stopped for a chat in the front galley with other crew members before even taking her coat off or putting handbag away she was in no rush whatsoever. We took off at 8pm 2 hours late not even an apology from the crew member the flight took off and wasn't great poor start made a lot of people fed up that they had to sit in the cramped conditions for 6 hours instead of the 4 it should have been. Service on board was terrible its just constant sales of junk food that tastes like cardboard £4 for bacon roll £3 for a box of micro chips and £2.60 for a cup of tea day light robbery. Be warned if you are unlucky enough to fly Thomson take your own food or they will rob you blind no entertainment on flight whatsoever so take ipads etc - what a shame how this airline has gone from good to bad now in the Ryanair league.

Newcastle to Palma on new 737's which were clean comfortable with plenty of room as we were sitting in the new extra leg room seats (3 rows at the front) and crews were friendly (unlike some reports below). On time but map display only shown on outbound (same as last year do they not work the other way?). My grudge though is you are sold a dream holiday with Thomson (differentiated product) for which you pay a fortune but in turn you get to fly with an airline that just isn't very special. Britannia and Air 2000 which were the best holiday airlines made you feel like you were going on holiday but have been transformed into a poor version of a low cost airline. If I wanted to fly on easyjet I would and I'd know what to expect. The flight used to mark the start of your holiday and include meal cup of tea etc now its just nothing special and you're asked to part with money every time you see the crew (including scratch cards sales and charity collection not just food and drink).

Thomson Sensatori Holiday to Turkey in June Gatwick to Antlaya. Outgoing flight: Checked-in online and printed boarding passes the day before with the idea being when we arrived we went just to 'drop bags'. We arrived nearly 2.5 hrs before the flight to then queue for over an hour - which seemed like a normal 'check-in' and then they printed boarding cards - why ask us to? Flight was cramped probably the smallest plane we've been on impossible to get comfortable and no entertainment for 3.5 hrs. Return flight was even worse - arrived at Antalya airport at 12 noon and got through security for 1.50pm for a 2.15pm flight so no time for food or drink at the airport. The plane was the same as outgoing flight no entertainment this time no food to choose from no ice for drinks etc. Flight experience both ways was awful to say the least.

This was the first time we flew the Dreamliner and was lucky enough to be sitting in the premium cabin at the front. Firstly many thanks to the cabin crew who were the best we have flown with. Nothing was too much for them and we never went without a drink or a friendly smile. The Dreamliner was brilliant and we cannot wait to go back on one. The flight (8 hours) seemed like a short haul flight - no tiredness as the pressurised air in the cabin is one of the best (extra oxygen). Plenty of seat space and leg room - head height was very high and didn't at all feel cramped at any time. The food was great! Fantastic overall.

Flew from Manchester to Gran Canaria (10.07.14) and my husband and I thought we were in a cattle market far too cramped and uncomfortable interior was dirty Thomson crew spent too much time gossiping on personal issues and did not appear to be interested in the passengers during service safety brief (via monitor) very lazy idea does not work return journey (18.07.14) exactly the same however staff wore different uniforms and again limited attention to passengers more interested in gossiping yet again. Positive note: captain of the plane honest and attentive with minor problems landing on both outward and inward flight and also bag drop off section the staff were lovely we bought this holiday very late and expected possible issues with hotel etc what we were not expecting was to complaining about what we thought was a reputable flight company.

Told at check in there was a plane change but still would get Premium etc. On arrival at gate told no premium as reviewer below said - put on an old 767 with only minimum leg room lack of toilets.

Travelled to the Dominican Republic on 25 May 14 premium cabin seats 1g and 1j on the Dreamliner both ways. These seats yes had more than adequate leg room but that's all not comfortable the recline is not adequate very worn out for such a new plane TV screens lose and dirty. This plane really has not a lot to offer and all the hype given to it is not justified. The food choices both ways ran out so you didn't get what you preferred to eat drinks selections again ran out. There were people coming through from economy to use the toilets in premium and staff weren't able or bothered to prevent this which meant that there were lines of people waiting. To top everything off on the inbound flight on the 8th June to Gatwick there was no water so no hot drinks or hand wash facilities in all this was supposed to be an experience for my partner who had never flown long haul to remember. It certainly turned out that way for all the wrong reasons and was not worth the near £600 it cost for the upgrade. Never would I recommend upgrading to anyone and in fact will never use Thomson again no customer support or service when we raised our concerns with them. If you have the chance use anther company.

### Thomson Airways customer review
Ironically I went on a Thomas Cook holiday to Costa Adeje in Tenerife but flew both ways with Thomson. I don't have a clue why this is the case but it's beyond the point of this review. My review here is of my flight back to EMA. It was a little cramped in the seats (I'm over 6' so to be expected) I'm no stranger to my legs being cramped. That's why I reserved an aisle seat where I could get my legs into a more comfortable position which they did follow through on so that's a good thing. The cabin crew were a bit lazy on this flight back which was over night so instead of doing the airline safety demonstration themselves they decided to instead bring down the screens and showed a video of a 5 year old girl run through it. The video wasn't anything good just the same malarkey that you hear every damn flight. The flight though was pretty bland 4 hours without any real entertainment to pass the monotony and I was instead using my tablet for the whole flight (I turned off the Wifi so don't think I'm stupid like that) which did help but I found myself still just wanting to get the flight over with. The food aboard was like any other. Snacks and drinks always the same but they did have some hot meals. Too bad they tasted cheap and I heard someone complaining of heartburn when they ate their meal. Still the price paid to fly was decent and the seats were somewhat comfortable (it would be a 5 if not for the horrible armrest which wouldn't lift and kept digging into my elbow) The seats did recline which is a positive and some people could sleep pretty easily. Not me I can't get to sleep on any plane doesn't matter how tired I am.

Tom 2200 8th July MAN-JSI (Skiathos) on B757. Plane took off on time fairly clean but showing its age. Cabin crew ok but did the minimum and pulled the curtain across blocking the use of front toilet. Note to cabin crew its a curtain and not a wall you can hear everything they say. Return Tom 2201 22 July JSI-MAN again on B757. Cabin Manager loved the sound off her own voice never off PA system! Plane clean but again past its sell by date looks good from outside though. Very bumpy on return and again Cabin Manager serving drinks at 2 pax at a time ok as in turbulence but after 15 mins no turbulence but continued to serve drinks at 2 pax at a time? We had Britannia Airways free headphones / free entertainment / free newspapers / cabin staff that loved their jobs now we have Thomson / First Choice. Pay for everything Tea / Coffee / seats constant use of PA selling this and that. 1 drinks service on both flights but all hot food is cooked and what's left (huge amount I saw) is thrown away. Can Thomson really afford to throw it all away on every flight! Can we please have cabin crew who look like they enjoy their job more face to face contact rather than look above. A better uniform would look great too some of the shirts looked very creased.

Travelled in Premium Economy on the Dreamliner on 15th May 2014 from Manchester to Puerto Vallarta Angel of the Skies on the way out and Alfie on the return. We were lucky enough to get seats 1G+J on both legs of the journey so had lots of legroom. The seat was comfortable as long as you only wanted to sit and relax but it was extremely uncomfortable for sleeping. The footrest is a complete waste of time and quite dangerous as it doesn't go up high enough and therefore pressure is on the lower leg which can't be good when you're flying for 11+ hours. The armrests were very shabby and quite loose the TV unit was also wobbly and dirty although it did work well and was responsive. Considering the plane is not very old it's starting to look quite worn and untidy it wasn't very clean on either journey. The crew on the outward journey were a bit miserable and not very forthcoming with drinks the return crew were much better although there was very little choice of drinks left and even less items to purchase onboard. Obviously we had no problems getting out of the seats in Row 1 and we couldn't guarantee getting those seats each time so unless the seats are changed I don't think I'd waste my money travelling in premium again in the future. It could be so good with just a few tweaks here and there overall ok but a little disappointed. The positive aspects were reduced jet lag very quiet and a great sense of space due to the height of the cabin.

Flew premium to Mexico 26th April 2014. Flight out food service drinks and seat pitch fantastic return flight 10th May 2014 food disgusting and inedible my husband called it slop. One drink the whole 9.5 hour flight seat pitch no more than you would get on normal economy flight back was on very old tired interior plane trays didn't work had to hold with your hand or knee as food and drinks would have fallen off. Don't bother booking and paying for premium on return flights from Mexico.

TOM7238 BHX-KGS 01/07/2014. Waited in a line for one hour due to a missing crew member who came strolling down like she didn't have a care in the world. Only to get onboard to be told we had another 30 minute wait due to missing our slot. Once we finally got into the air the crew did a chaotic drinks service which seemed rushed and unorganised. It must have become all too much for three of the crew as they decided to take a seats in row one for 20/25 minutes taking about their children. Just before landing one of the crew members did the most pathetic congratulation to a just married couple I have ever heard she even put the tannoy down before finishing the sentence. The return flight (TOM7239 08/07/14) at least had crew that seemed interested and actually interacted with the customers.

We travelled from Newcastle to Mexico on the 23 June 2014 for two weeks we were told it would be the Dreamliner it was not. We had booked premier seats on the direct flight. After we boarded we were told we had to fly to Manchester to stock up with fuel and food and a new crew an hour down and an hour on the ground at Manchester two hours more to a ten hour flight. Coming back on 8th July no drinks on board. Crew spent all the time sitting at front speaking.

Will be using this service in the future.

TOM719 Agadir to Stansted. The crew on this night flight stampeded along the aisle like a herd of elephants. I sat in the aisle and was knocked constantly. This was magnified by the hard seats with no cushioning. They really wanted to maximise discomfort. The plane was really filthy they did not clean between flights I wonder if they ever do as they maximise the number of trips. They failed to order disabled assistance as always happens then blame someone else. This was confirmed by the lovely people who eventually came to assist. Thomson is only interested in flogging anything and everything you're a captive audience to be sold to. There is zero service only selling. I will never use this company again.

### Thomson Airways customer review
Flew on the New Dreamliner 9th June 2014 Gatwick to Cancun very disappointing. Yes you get a bit more leg room but that's it plane dirty TVS not working properly and not enough toilets for the amount of people. We were boarded at the correct time but sat on the runway for 90 minutes sweating because of a mess up and then they had the cheek to charge us for a water once in the air. I know no airlines are perfect but Thomson has been the worst airline I have flown with.

### Thomson Airways customer review
Thomson seat selection is a joke if you are traveling for more then 2 weeks. We decided to go to Florida for 28 days Thomson seat selection policy is that you can only select seats 90 days prior to your return flight. So if you traveling for 2 weeks you get to select your seat 2 weeks before I can. When I was given the choice there was not 2 seats left together. I've tried to point this problem out over the last 6 months by phone and email without any luck remember I paid for seat selection.

Booked to visit Montego Bay flying on a 787 from Gatwick when it came to boarding at Gatwick plane downgraded to a very old 767 without notice. Flight out was very poor but at least cabin crew were OK. Inbound flight was. 787 but the seating is a joke You have to be an escapologist to get out to go to the toilet to make matters worse this was a new plane and the TV nor reading light worked this on a 9 hr overnight flight. Thomson have spent thousands on the 787 hype and in my case the whole flight experience in both directions was a joke. Never again Thomson I have to work too hard for my money to waste it on very poor service.

### Thomson Airways customer review
Flew from Birmingham to Palma Mallorca 31/05/2014. We dislike the new common queue system intensely as no matter how early you arrive there is a long snaking line of passengers for other destinations. It is now required that all passengers check in online. This saves Thomson time and the cost of ink and paper to print boarding passes. When we arrived at the airport we imagined that we would be through to security quickly as we only had to leave our cases at the baggage drop. Imagine our disappointment and annoyance to find that not only was there still the long queue but there were only two people accepting the baggage as opposed to seven or eight staff in the previous check in process. We had to queue for 35 minutes to drop off our bags. It would appear that these new processes only advantage Thomson to the detriment of the customer experience that they offer. It really is no better than using Ryan Air's cattle class service. It does not get ones long awaited holiday off to a very good start and leaves one with a negative opinion of Thomson.

My wife and I flew on TOM052/053 Gatwick to Cancun on 19th May as it was our honeymoon we flew Premium on the dreamliner. We were excited about going on the dreamliner and overall we were happy with our choice The previous comments regarding the seats are accurate as the recline is poor and the footrest isn't much better The inflight entertainment needs expanding the screens are stored within the armrests and they are very dirty inside My wife's screen was insecure and wouldn't stay in the one position Thomson really need to address the seating in this aircraft as this is a new plane and already showing signs of wear and tear and isn't very comfortable for long haul the staff are very good and the service is good.

Flight TOM 046 - TOM 047 Sanford. Everything top class except the seat pitch in premium economy is very poor I understand that Thomson has started taking out the seats in premium economy on 1st June to enable more pitch as either Thomson or Boeing got it all wrong this was according to one of the cabin staff we were talking to at the end of our holiday this would be a big improvement. Otherwise cabin staff very good flight very good felt a lot better when you get off the plane compared to the 767's. Flight was one hour late getting away but managed to cut half hour of this by the time we landed (outward journey) and this was headwind all the way to Florida. Quieter flight lots more oxygen in the cabin making it a comfortable flight seats were row 5 2 seats starboard side good window seat. Have booked the same again for next June one hiccup Jetsave forgot to arrange our transfer from Sanford to Disney but Mickey and Minnie rescued us for $5.

Flew BRS - EFL on 29/05/2014 and return leg on 05/06/2014 on a 757-200. Positives first both flights on time and landed early cabin crew were polite and helpful and leg room was just about OK bearing in mind I'm 6ft 2in but for a 3.5 hour flight it was OK even with the window seat. The negative the plane was dirty on the inside and we were the first flight that plane had done one the way out no excuse really for Thomson apart from cutting corners with cleaning! Also the plane was very old now it works and got us there and back but was rather tatty in places and could do with a re-furb or replacement! Overall it was good like I said on time friendly staff just a bit dirty/grubby and old/tatty will use them again if the price is right!

Flew to Corfu with Thomson to join one of their cruises all I can say is the inflight experience leaves a lot to be desired. The way out they didn't carry half the items listed because they had been delisted this apparently was only after a few weeks? On the return the flight was shambolic no hot food by the time we got served in the middle of the aircraft we waited in excess of 1hr 45mins for a drink. Crew either incompetent or inexperienced. No tonics carried that day due to stock issues! No crisps hardly any hot food to buy. Only red wine available. The flight was painful start and end to the holiday. Never again.

Travelled to Cyprus on may 21 2014 we were on a 737-800 from Birmingham. The flight was on time boarding well organised and on entering the cabin was pleased how modern and clean it was. The seats were comfortable and had plenty of legroom the cabin crew were very pleasant and professional during the flight. On our return flight we travelled on a 757 which also was very new and clean with the bonus of departing Cyprus 20 minutes early and arriving at Birmingham 35 minutes ahead of schedule. The captain was very pleasant on this journey and would fly with Thomson again.

17th May flight Manchester to Punta Cana on the 787 Dreamliner. Paid for extra leg room seats row 30 B/C no window on this row these seats are next to the toilets in the middle of the economy cabin there was a constant queue for the toilets for most of the flight people stood next to and in front of us. Food was very poor - meal offered was pasta which we don't eat no alternative available. It's a good job we ate at Manchester airport prior to boarding. Return flight sat in row 10A/B these are also extra leg room seats which were an improvement from row 30 - large window. Seat pitch is good but the seats don't seem as wide as the 767 seats.

I travelled to the Dominican Republic on the 11th May 2014 and as it was a very special occasion I booked premium for the 4 of us. Waste of money. Window and middle seats are very hard to get out of. Staff outbound were very friendly and helpful but the return flight they were moody and unhelpful and could not be bothered to serve us our drinks! Meals were supposed to be different from economy (but our friends who sat in economy) had the exact food as premium. I did not know children were allowed in premium (8 hours non stop screaming). It was a nightmare. Stick to economy. Premium a waste of good money!

### Thomson Airways customer review
Travelled beginning of May to Fuerteventura and on the return journey firstly there was surprisingly more passengers on the plane than on the paperwork. A discrepancy of 100 passengers. This meant more fuel had to be put on the plane and thankfully this was noticed by the flight crew. The cabin crew were rude the curtain was pulled across all the flight resulting in the front two toilets only one being available and when you ask to use the other toilet the look you get from the crew. Definitely a them and us situation. Passengers were greeted with rude responses. Really poor service with having to wait 1 hour and half before getting the first drink. Then had to wait 45 mins for the rubbish to be cleared away after having hot food. This included the drinks rubbish. Poorly organised and disgusting service. What's worse is their response after complaining nothing was documented about the need to refuel and the discrepancy and will be dealt with internally. Nothing for us being a special occasion and they portray they deliver excellent service and safety. Never again will we use this airline!

### Thomson Airways customer review
Went on a tired and stained old plane from East Midlands to Cancun in the last two weeks. Had premier seats but still cramped no menu (just as well as I have never got what I asked for) and not comfortable. The base of the seats seem blown. Anyway as usual night flight so no premium service. We went to Dom Rep on the dreamliner last year not much different its ok saying the windows are so much bigger but due to the cramming in few windows are in a comparable line of view from the seats. A bit pointless. Couldn't feel any enhanced travel comfort its better for the staff and premier is a rip off. As you pay 6 months in advance you still have to sit up at midnight when the seats open to book then find that week holiday makers on the same flight can book 90 days before which is 97 days before you so they get the seats they want.

### Thomson Airways customer review
Have just returned from Florida travelling both ways on the much hyped Dreamliner and disappointed to say the least. After paying for being seated together we were split up on the way out. There were many other families experiencing the same issue. My main gripe is the width of the seats they were so uncomfortable it beggars belief and certainly don't match the comfort of the old 747. We are not large people at all but seating in a row with my son and husband both six foot in height and average weight we were like sardines crushed together! So disapointed as this was the first time on long haul for my other son and family and not impressed as if the person in front reclined you had to crane your neck to watch the seat back TV! All drinks had to be paid for and the food just average as for the dancing lights yep I agree you see them for about 2 mins enough time to say Wow! Certainly if we ever travelled long haul again I would not be looking to travelling economy with Thomson!

### Thomson Airways customer review
Gatwick - Cancun - Gatwick. This was in the new 787 Dreamliner. Premium Economy has a 2-3-2 configuration and a 36” seat pitch. All flights on time. Meals rather ordinary but drinks dispensed generously. A good selection of films and other entertainment on the IFE system stored in the armrest. Two toilets in the Premium cabin one in the forward galley and one at the rear of the cabin; on the outward leg I was rather brusquely asked to sit in my seat rather than wait in the galley for the toilet to become available this seemed a bit unnecessary and over assertive for the sake of it since I wasn't in anybody's way but other than that service was generally good. Regarding the Dreamliner cabin air is apparently of a higher quality than other aircraft due to greater cabin pressure and humidity difficult to say for sure how much difference this made but I disembarked both flights feeling in good shape. The cabin ceiling is comparatively high and the overhead baggage compartments are generously sized. A few issues though. As many others have noted there is a serious problem with the design of the seats / armrests; even with a 36” pitch if the person in front has reclined their seat then it's very difficult unless you have an aisle seat to exit your seat without climbing over the passenger next to you. Also although the aircraft have been in service less than a year the seats are already looking the worse for wear; some of the plastic trim in the armrests is coming loose some of the IFE screen mechanisms were also very loose (on the outward journey I noticed that someone had needed to jam bits of cardboard in the mechanism of my IFE system to keep the TV screen upright) and on the return journey the footrest on the seat of one of my party was jammed in the extended position. Finally although we were given a nice printed menu of all the beverages supposedly available on the return journey we were told that several of these had been withdrawn so the variety of soft drinks is actually rather less than Thomson were advertising. On the whole pretty good and I think the 787 sets new standards but for the extra we paid for Premium seats we expected a bit more.

On a recent flight to and from Greece on 15/5/14-23/5/14 we were charged an extra £40 to sit next to each other when we were in fact charged for extra legroom when the seats didn't have extra legroom and it wasn't what we asked for the young man who booked us in said because we hadn't printed off our boarding passes and checked in online we would have to pay which was quite displeasing. In Kefalonia we were told we shouldn't have had to pay this money as there were other seats together that were vacant. When we headed for our return trip again we had to pay £60 to sit next to each other this time there was extra legroom but again we weren't bothered about the extra legroom just wanted to be sat together.

We flew to Puerto Vallarta on the new Dreamliner 787 and found the aircraft a lot better than most I have been on. There is plenty more leg room and especially as my husband is 6' 4" having the extra leg room on a long haul flight meant he had a much more comfortable trip. I'm not sure how the 'dancing disco' lights are supposed to help with jet lag though. My only issue is with the flight attendants. On the outbound flight they were nothing less than rude. They gave the impression that we as passengers were putting them out when they came around to serve us. Everyone was 'thrown' a rubbish bag and we were 'told' not asked 'told' to collect all our rubbish up including on the floor space around us! When we were exiting the flight I tried to make polite conversation with one of the attendants as we waited to exit. All I got was a shrug of the shoulders and an eyeball roll!

I booked the Dreamliner in December 2012 for three premium flights April 2014 (based upon my medical condition). We got a 17 year old crammed and worn out 767 on an extended lease previously very well used and abused by Airtours that was due to be sold on. The crew were very apologetic and said they had had quite a few similar complaints. It was not a delivery issue as they had the Dreamliner and were actually using it to fly to our destination but decided to fly it from another airports without telling us or giving us the chance to move. Despite my booking I was never told of the change and it was not for operational or weather related reasons. Even the premium seats were old worn and poor and it ruined our dream holiday. Don't fall for the adverts.

Just came back from Sharm travelling on a first choice flight we have decided never again. The seats are so tired and small and if you are unlucky enough to have the person in front put their seat back you are in real trouble. The space is horrific. I had to stand for most of a 5 hour flight as there was no room for my legs - yes my legs. Ok I am 5"7 with long legs. I could not sit down as the seat in front of me was resting on my knees. I asked for the seat to be put up but was told the passenger in front had the right to put his seat back. Do I not have the right to have room to sit in a seat which I have paid for. I generally pay for extra leg room but due to travelling with children you can't have extra leg room.

We booked in Aug 2013 to travel in May 2014 for a family of 7 adults and booked Premium Economy to Orlando Sanford. Only found out when checking the API status that the plane had been changed to a larger one on the outbound flight only but this plane had a reduced amount of Premium seats. We contacted Thomson who denied all knowledge of this and after about 3 months of constant phone calls we were told that Premium seating would be on a first booked basis and we would be downgraded on the outbound flight and Premium on the inbound. Obviously we were not happy with this but we did receive money back. Our new seats were only allocated 2 days before our trip which was stressful. When we arrived at check in however we were still in Premium on their computer and had to stand for 45 mins at the desk whilst it was sorted - not good at 7 am. Flight out was ok except my husbands earphone socket didn't work but luckily there was a spare seat he could use. I find it annoying we have to pay for refreshments on a long haul flights and think its time Thomson included this in the price. Return flight was Premium with early boarding and all refreshments included. Food choice was good and the cabin crew attentive and helpful. Inflight entertainment was not as advertised in the on board brochure with only limited films available. Luggage retrieval in Manchester was a nightmare with most luggage on the flight apparently 'lost' for 45 mins. We have travelled with Thomson holidays on many occasions with no problems with flights but this was a flight only purchase and I will never book just flights with them again.

### Thomson Airways customer review
Gatwick - Cancun return in May 2014 on their new 787 Dreamliner. All the hype given is about this new aircraft falls flat due mainly to Tui deciding to turn "Economy Class" into "Cattle Class". On-Board entertainment media is rather mediocre. Meals have become stingier and bland. A heated five inch roll with a slice of tomato & cheese for breakfast just before landing at LGW was a joke. The aircraft is noisy from engine roar. Leg room is better than other planes due to the fact that you can get your legs under the seat in front. The windows are said to be 30% bigger - big deal! Headroom is good when standing due to the arched ceiling but you're seated 90% of the time. Light fleecy blankets were given out for sleeping during the return flight only to be dragged off tired young children as they disembarked by flight staff. And finally families i.e. 2 adults + 2-3 children who hadn't pre-booked and paid extra to reserve seats had to sit scattered about the aircraft. A poor show all- in-all!

When is the best time to book flights? Never with Thomson Airways unless you have a lot of money to waste. Booked flights from Doncaster to Malaga for 2 adults and paid GBP 565. Three days later flight costs were down to GBP 295. Booked flights from Doncaster to Faro for 4 adults & 2 infants I paid GBP 1700 - I have since seen the same for GBP 595. Totally disgusted with Thomson.

Flew out of NCL-SSH on the new 737's plane out super clean modern comfortable on time really smooth flight. Way back was a slightly different newer 737 seemed a little smaller. Gutted to find out that row 14 didn't recline especially as it was a night flight. I always feel airlines take to long to dim the lights as they are too busy trying to sell you things. The food and drink is expensive. Shame they don't do hot meals on short/mid haul anymore. Seat pitch wasn't great but not the worst either. I would travel with them again.

Three passengers on flight had already had too much to drink but cabin staff still sold them endless bottles of wine they were loud and annoying all through the flight and cabin staff did nothing. Seats were dirty. Seat in front broken and could not be put in the upright position. Return flight plane much smaller with restricted leg room.

Holiday arranged to fly on Dreamliner 25 April from Gatwick to Sanford with 11.25 am take off. Actual take off 6.05 pm. Over 6.5 hours delayed. No contact from Thomson's at Gatwick as to why the plane could not be used. Seems it was grounded due to Technical problems.

Good experience overall. Outbound and inbound both had empty seats so that will of course have given an impression of even more room. Flew Economy with extra leg room seats on 787 and I feel that it was worth it. Seats 10C and 10D on both sectors. Prompt efficient and friendly service timely flights and the aircraft certainly has shaved the flight time. Does the lighting/improved oxygen etc. help? I think it does. I'm don't cross the Atlantic every week but am no stranger to long haul and on landing after both sectors felt better than normal - maybe it's psychological! Better than my last BA/Virgin crossings but be warned- PE in my humble opinion really isn't worth the difference. Had a good look (even during the flight) and glad that the extra £589 stayed in my wallet. That's my next golf trip covered!

Flew Premium Economy to Cancun and back on an old First Choice 767. 10.5 hours out and 9.5 hours return. Check in a breeze at Manchester. Absolute mayhem at Cancun on arrival but not too bad an experience on departure. The flights were uneventful the food mostly edible and service from the friendly crew was fine. I've heard that the 767's are to be eventually retired in favour of the Dreamliner and that might tempt me back long haul with Thomson. Not 100% sure if the Premium Economy is value for money but although the leg room was acceptable seat width was not. Other than that Thomson got me there and back and that is all I wished for.

Booked to fly on Dreamliner 25 April from Gatwick to Sanford with 11.25 am take off. Actual take off 6.05 pm. Over 6.5 hours delayed. Given one £4 voucher each for myself and wife that didn't cover cost of sausage roll. Told to start boarding at 4pm but as stated above didn't take off till 2 hours later. Booked Dreamliner because it had extra legroom as I've just had a hip replacement and would have liked the extra room. Eventually flew out on an older plane with standard seat pitch so felt slightly cramped. Was asked to pay £2.60 for a cup of coffee on the flight despite the long delay. The captain says the original plane had been hit by a lightning strike but I have scanned the internet and many news items and forums but cannot see anything with this news story. It started out when we received a text at 6.04am on morning of the flight saying our flight had been delayed until 3pm. When we arrived at the airport this was then delayed again to 3.30pm then 3.55pm then finally just after 4pm told to go to the Gate for boarding. Our first and only Thomson flight.

Having travelled with Thomson on the 787 Dreamliner to Cancun on 12/04/14. Priority check-in and fast track at Manchester was easy and stress free we flew Premium Economy and the extra price on the 787 was well worth the money. So much space so quiet the only down fall to the 787 at the moment is the seating layout or should I say the seat design if you want to get out of your seat and you are seated at the window or in the middle seats you have to be able to bend to get out. The middle arm rests make it near impossible to get out of your seats without disturbing people in front or behind. The crew are happy and always willing to help the food was good and the inflight entertainment was very good. All in all don't be put off by the seating this is as good as Virgin but at half the price and I will be booking the Premium 787 for our next long haul holiday.

Travelled to Orlando 10 April. Premium check in was good fast pass through security however luggage didn't get priority when claimed. Also disembarking was a free for all. Flight was good nice quiet engines. Coming home from Sandford big slow moving queue for Premium the other Thomson queue moved faster no fast pass through security. Flight good had to wait a while for steps to disembark very primitive for such a prestigious plane this isn't mentioned in the adverts! Then bus back to terminal however cabin crew let premium cabin off first! Again baggage just appeared when it did no special tags. Thomson need to sort these issues out as they do not match the advertisements of sheer luxury at a price!

Flew to Punta Cana and back on Dreamliner good seat pitch although seats are a bit narrow. Thomson is now the Ryanair of long haul apart from one small water and one coffee with your meal all other drinks have to be purchased including water which should be free on a long flight. However entertainment is good staff were pleasant and efficient on both trips meal going out was terrible passable on the return.

Travelled Premium Economy on TOM046 from Gatwick to Sandford on 2 November 2013. Was scheduled to depart at 9.15 so checked in at 6.00 Checking in was excellent and we made our way to the NO 1 Lounge arriving shortly after 6.00. We had booked the lounge to hopefully start the journey in a relaxed way. At approx 8.30 we entered the main terminal to enquire about the obvious delay. There were no Thomson staff on duty at the information desk until 9.00 where a large number of disgruntled passengers had gathered. £5 vouchers were handed out but with no explanation for the delay. We then returned to the lounge but were only allowed to stay for the unexpired period of our 3 hours entitlement namely 30 minutes. We eventually departed at 13.00 having spent the remainder of the time in the far relaxed environment of the terminal building. We were not impressed by the over hyped Dreamliner and agree with the majority of points mentioned on this site. Due to Thomsons lack of customer care we will not be booking with Thomson again.

Our flight was from Manchester to Naples and back. We booked extra space seats and we found them comfortable for the length of flight. The flight took off on time with no delays. Boarding was quick and easy in both directions. Flight was 3 hours. We were on a weeks holiday with only 15 kg each check in. We had no problems with that. The flight attendants were busy due to the short flight with first drinks then hot food and finally duty free. The prices of the food on board was not too bad. But we had brought our own food on board. It was everything I would have expected in a short haul flight and will use again.

Flew with Thomson to Mombasa for the first time on Dreamliner. The aisles are too narrow so constant buffeting by stewards had to pay for coffee and when queried the steward was rude and suggested we fly with another airline next time the stewards were chatting all night in the galley so no sleep our cases together with those of 50 other passengers left on plane which had parked elsewhere at Gatwick. No one from Thomson available for comment at the time so had to hang around for an hour and a half awaiting outcome. Stressful experience all round and no help from customer services so we will not use this company again.

I travelled with my husband and 7 year old daughter on the Dreamliner Manchester to Cancun in Aug 2013. We had a fantastic experience on the plane. The upgrade to premium economy was worth every penny we were sat in row 1 in the middle we had plenty of room so much that my daughter sat on floor playing games for some of flight. The food was fab we were given a choice of 3 meals and drink was free flowing whole of flight. My only problem being short was unable to reach over head lockers. We were very comfortable and thought space at back of premium economy section was fab as it enabled you to walk round stretch legs etc we stood chatting to other passengers enjoying flight! The pilot after landing even let my daughter look in cockpit and ask questions made whole experience better. We enjoyed experience so much already booked Dreamliner for this Aug premium economy again.

We flew on the Dreamliner from Manchester to Cancun. We opted to upgrade to premium seating. The experience was well worth the money. Every aspect about the flight was all that was advertised. If only all flight experiences were like this.

### Thomson Airways customer review
Having flown out to Cacun on the Dreamliner it was a shock and a huge disappointment to return from Cancun on flight Tom 197 on an old First Choice banger. We had upgraded to premium but premium it was not. Seating was cramped up against the bulk head in F1 and G1. 36 inches of leg room? Never. 9 inch seat back TV. No a screen tucked in between the seats so hard to get out as was the tray tables. Neither was user friendly. The seats so hard you would have thought you were sitting on a park bench. You could hear the moans in the cabin as people discovered what they had bought in their upgrade. A 9.5 hour flight that was uncomfortable.

### Thomson Airways customer review
Have flown twice in the premium cabin to Goa and Thailand and would not waste my money again having booked both holidays at the same time after our first leg of four we realised that we had been conned. The seating layout was dreadful how anyone could come up with that layout beggars belief. Firstly the recline and footrest were pathetic there was very little recline and the footrest was not worth the effort in addition to this we were trapped in our seats unless you had an aisle seat you could not get out without your neighbour getting up first which when you have 11 hour plus flights is just not good enough. The food was at best very average and overall a horrible experience. This was simply a case of a new plane with the potential to deliver a first class experience ruined by greedy Thomson executives taking my money under false pretences.

I booked to fly from Bournemouth in Feb 2014 but after booking Thomson changed the departure location to Gatwick. I was given £25 pp compensation but the change proved considerably more expensive and inconvenient. Subsequently I noticed that flights from Gatwick are invariably cheaper than from Bournemouth but in taking this up with Thomson plus the likelihood of a flight being changed again they have proved most unhelpful. I shall not fly with them again despite taking frequent trips to Lanzarote.

TOM847 21 March 2014. The worst flight I have had the misfortune to be on no room to move no leg room nowhere to stand nothing to listen to or watch. The food was disgusting and the cramped conditions bordering on dangerous. Take some of the seats out and put the prices up before everyone stops flying on journeys longer than 2 hours.

Flew from East Midlands to Mexico last October on 787 Dreamliner with two little kids and my husband. I loved the aircraft. The cabin crew were so kind with the children. They gave them colouring books and helped us get the TV's working. My husband and I enjoyed the large space. At about 8.20 UK time we received our all day breakfast which was excellent. About 3 hours later the children woke up and had a little continental breakfast. Later we had our mid-air snack whilst flying over New York. I enjoyed the flight and we are going to Mexico again this year on 30th July.

Flew to Cuba Dreamliner 12th March for one week Premium. Worst flight I have ever had (not the planes fault). Seating arrangement very poor trapped in my seat on back row near loo when I did need to get out I had to climb over the seat next to me food dreadful worst I have had on a flight. Sleep impossible hardly any recline. Travelled Premium on old first choice plane last year it was much more comfortable with service to match.

Flew Birmingham to Sal in early March. Standard seats on the 757 are pretty brutal especially on a longer sector the seat pitch is just too tight to get comfortable. Food provided in the fare was a bonus and acceptable.

### Thomson Airways customer review
Flew out to Cancun on the Dreamliner on 5th March and back on 12th. I must say the first thing that struck me on boarding was the sense of space - the seat pitch is much better than the 767 and the entertainment was superb. Crew were really attentive overall a brilliant flight and loved the aircraft.

### Thomson Airways customer review
Flew out 16th Feb TOM060. Returned 3rd March TOM061. Worst long haul flight I have taken. We travelled budget but with extra leg room seats. We were not told that they claim back the extra legroom by providing the narrowest seats I have ever travelled in. It is a physical impossibility for all 3 passengers to eat a meal at the same time even though they are all provided together. The food is another story could it be Thomson want to outdo all other airlines by providing the worst food I have encountered in 30 years of travelling. This after spending 60 minutes in the plane on the tarmac due to the complete breakdown of Thomson booking in procedure (which I am informed occurs regularly). Never again.

### Thomson Airways customer review
16th Feb 2014 TOM 054. 3rd March TOM 055. Dreamliner. Overall feeling of space is good plenty of overhead storage though some of the cabin crew can not reach in the bins I would have thought this a safety issue. I know this is an Inclusive tour type operation but with a new aircraft I found it very disappointing I am 5 ft 9 ins and not overweight the seats are tiny if you are a large person a long sector would be hell seat pitch is more generous than some. You pay for everything ok it's that sort of airline but you should never have to pay for water. Food just ok as is the entertainment. All in all you get what you pay for and we knew this but for a new aircraft I would have thought the seats and aisles should be bigger cabin service ok but some of our cabin crew neede to be re trained in customer service. We thought we should try them but will never fly long haul with them again I would pay more for a scheduled Airlime premium cabin.

We flew to Dominican Republic on 14 February in Thomson's new Sardineliner. The seat width is 1 inch less than usual to cram more people in Economy and although there is more leg room being unable to move left us both with an aching back. The food was horrible. Frozen food was stored in the Passenger overhead lockers leaving insufficient room for passengers belongings and water condensed on the boxes and dripped on our clothes - my jacket in the locker was soaking wet. The plane had to make an emergency landing and use the full length of the runway because the top wing flaps failed to work. We learned that 2 weeks previous the flight was delayed by 24hrs because of technical problems. Our return flight was delayed 24hrs due to "technical problems" again. We were moved to inferior accommodation. The only good thing I can say is that the pilot kept everyone well informed and was honest about all problems encountered.

Flew back from Barbados to Birmingham on 2nd March on a Boeing 767-300 which had been charted by P&O. The aircraft was 5 hours late taking off due to the knock on effect of technical problems with their so called Dreamliner. During our arrival at Barbados airport we were in addition informed by letter that the entertainment system was not working not what you want to hear when you have an 8hr flight in front of you. We had upgraded to premium class and expected better from Thomson and it worries us that they can not maintain an entertainment system which also included the reading light service call etc. The one positive from this flight was that the staff on TOM 831 were superb and really tried to make the journey as bearable as possible.

### Thomson Airways customer review
Had the most uncomfortable 8hr flight on a 767 aircraft from Barbados to Gatwick on 1 March 2014 which had been chartered by P and O Cruises. The plane must have been at least 30 years old passengers were treated badly by staff who just weren't interested in the complaints. The food was a disgrace the temperature in the cabin was so cold that most passengers had to sit with a blanket around them when I asked staff if they could increase the temperature I was told it could not be adjusted. The aircraft had individual TVs but there wasn't any headphones. The air conditioning was leaking above our heads. We were supposed to have returned on the new Dreamliner aircraft which we flew to Barbados on but apparently it had a technical problem which none of the Thomson staff onboard knew about so was replaced by the 767.

Travelled with Thomson on Dreamliner to Phuket in economy 13 hrs Feb 2014 returned on 19th Feb in Premium class. Economy was fine same choice of IF entertainment as premium which was great loads of choice of blockbuster films games TV programmes etc. I did find the economy earphones not to be great as they let in lots of background noise so bring your own! - adequate leg room (row 33). We did not witness any disruption to row 30 because of toilet queues as per previous reviews. Food was ok in line with all airline food - there was no choice however service was great with lots of visits to buy drinks etc. Was a comfortable 13 hour flight (if there is such a thing) roomy cabin and I thought only slightly quieter than other aircraft's. We travelled back Premium check in was great although you don't get VIP service through security at Phuket. The seats are obviously larger and more comfortable though the foot rest is a waste of time! Service was great with choice of menus and lots of drink availability. If you are in middle seat or window make sure you are familiar with the person beside you as getting out is feat given the arm rests! The option to stretch your legs at the back of the premium cabin was a great facility however and I think almost everyone took advantage of this. Thomson wanted £750 return for premium - not worth that in my opinion rather spend that on the holiday. Food was ok in line with all airline food - there was no choice however service was great with lots of visits to buy drinks etc. Disembarking was a joke as Premium are supposed to be let of first – a few people stampeding from economy cabin pushing in front of premium passengers once doors open – Thomson staff said nothing. Our cases were then the last off! So still some points to iron out. On the whole the cabin staff were very friendly and helpful I tend to think that after a 14 hour flight they couldn't be bothered anymore which I can understand.

We travelled to Sharm in March 2013. Outbound flight was unremarkable. Average budget airline enough legroom but only just. 5 hours with only a kindle to watch films on. Seems all airlines are like this on 5hr hour journeys. The return flight was delayed arriving in Sharm to collect us. Thomsons organised coaches took us to a hotel for the night. All inclusive meal drinks and breakfast. Then flew us home the next morning.

ACE-MAN B752 yesterday 23/2/14 aircraft G-CPEU delivered to BA in 1999 originally. Cabin crew requested 2 volunteers to exchange seats with a couple plus infant due to an oxygen mask issue. No problem really except crew member failed to state whereabouts of the swap so person in row 40 offered to swap but having walked up (and back) through the cabin was informed that volunteers already sorted! Just poor communication. Leg room in economy doubtlessly previously highlighted by reviewers but agreed not good. Seemingly endless cabin crew announcements including full description of the 3 supported charities (for scratchcard sales naturally and loose change giving on disembarkation). Better to put a flyer in seatback so pax can read and donate if they so wish. A neighbouring pax was taken ill during flight but was quickly and effectively dealt with by the crew. Flight deck announcements good especially being informed they would get back to us at "top of descent" for MAN weather info etc loved the terminology due to being keen aviation enthusiast. Message to Thomson-cut cabin announcements as far as is practicable; listen to customer feedback and remove a few rows of seats to increase overall pitch - I'm more than willing to stump up a little more money for this.

### Thomson Airways customer review
BHX-LPA 17th Feb and LPA-LGW on 20th Feb. Thomson is now more like a budget airline long gone are the days of meals on charter flights fancy uniforms the snacks menu is so limited and hardly exciting. The Cabin Crew are genuinely nice and must wonder what ever happened to this airline. Nothing fancy nothing glamorous anymore about this charter airline. I booked last minute and the price was excellent but that's it.

MAN to Punta Cana in Premium Economy. Seats 9c and D. Dedicated check in and Fast Pass through security meant we were all done in 15 minutes Heathrow please note how it should be done! Row 9 on the 767 is the last row of PE seats and as such there is no lighting or windows the only light being the overhead lights which did not work so we were almost in the dark despite it being a day flight. The IFE did not work despite the crew re-booting many times. The food served was actually alright but expecting PE passengers to pay for snacks is wrong. The seats were comfortable if a little narrow with adequate legroom. All Cabin Crew were pleasant and smiling throughout. The aircraft is clearly old and tired and will probably be replaced soon with the new 787. We arrived on time. Not sure the extra paid for PE is worth it it is a long way from Virgin or BA PE. Would use Thomsons again if needed.

### Thomson Airways customer review
I was excited to be flying with the well known "Dreamliner". On my way to Florida they boasted about having the great lighting system with multi-coloured lights which you only see for 2 minutes after taking off and the boasted about window darkening feature being electronic and no need for shutters like normal planes. I think that was their only highlight of flying with the Dreamliner. Food - there are no options to choose from if you ordered a meat dish then you take what is given there is no alternative which is annoying. On the way back they gave us a beef dish which me and my husband do not eat. After asking for a vegetarian option they said sorry all meals are counted for. So we went without food. There was no blanket on the way there or on the way back. We had to keep our headphones that were given to us on the way there and use them on the way back. The pouch with magazines was covered in bits of food. The general condition of the plane was tatty it definitely wasn't clean. No soft drinks you have to pay for that. You only get water and that's with your food. Tea and Coffee only with your food if you want it any other time you must pay for this. No eye mask or socks. Overall I would say the Dreamliner doesn't live up to the dream!

### Thomson Airways customer review
Our holiday in Marrakech was excellent however our flight home was quite a disappointment. Moments prior to departing (all safety procedures had been performed cabin doors were armed attendants had been asked to take their seats) the Captain then announced an apology for the delay and reported we would be departing shortly. After a further 10-15 mins he announced that they needed to refuel. That said we were only 15-20 mins late arriving. I travel long haul flights a lot and I've never experienced anything like this before.

### Thomson Airways customer review
My first experience on the 787 Dreamliner yesterday flying Manchester - Cancun route. On the whole it was a very pleasing experience. I was sat in 16G and the legroom was great for me (6' 1"). Inflight service was good with attendants very attentive. Food was bog standard but edible. IFE was good in terms of choice for the 10:30 flight time. Seats were comfortable enough. I do feel sympathy for the people that upgrade to extra legroom seats in row 30 as this area does full up with people queuing for toilets not matter how many times the flight attendants make announcements. As far as the 787 us concerned I was particularly taken with the large windows and headroom in the cabin. The large windows give passengers in aisle seats and centre cabin seats the ability to have some view outside. Great advancement. Looking forward to see how the mood lighting and oxygen rich environment aid the jet lag process on our return.

### Thomson Airways customer review
Flew Dreamliner - premium to Thailand 28th Jan return 12th Feb. When entering the aircraft first impressions were good feels airy light and spacious but once seated you start to notice the problems especially with the silly situation of the armrests between the seats jutting out too far to accommodate the entertainment systems where before these were housed in the back of the seat in front. Does not recline as far back as the old seats found it more comfortable to sit bolt up right as when trying to use the decline it made me slouch so not good for people with back problems also the seats are rather hard so my bottom was sore after a long 13 hr flight on the way back. My main grouch is the lack of "service" from the crew well basically there wasn't any. I don't think that premium has dedicated staff for that cabin anymore. Yes we appeared to get fed and watered first then they would vanish behind the curtain to the main section of the plane and you wouldn't see them for ages. Checked the most recent brochure which doesn't mention dedicated staff as in previous years so look's like cutting back on costs via staffing levels. There was also an issue with food orders on the way back for the main course which resulted in quite a few people not having their requested choice one of the cabin crew even had the cheek to say to a lady that she wasn't flying first class so shouldn't expect that service. Apart from when we first took off when the cabin crew came round with drink orders and also offered wine with our main course we were never offered another drink as on previous flights and a lot of times there was no one to ask anyway so what are we actually paying for? 3/4 extra inches and uncomfortable seating would be the answer. We have always flown premium when going long haul with Thomson but am now seriously thinking about cancelling our premium seating already booked for our next holiday. There are a few positives I liked that they have an extra loo in the cabin that there is a little area at the back of the last row of seating where you can stretch your legs and that there was ample storage.

Flew to Jamaica 9th Jan 2014 upgraded to premium class but did not receive premium service. Had to board with all the other passengers no drinks on flight back for over 1 hour. Brochure shown dreamliner or new 767 we flew on oldest most uncomfortable plane I have ever been on.

### Thomson Airways customer review
Travelled to Goa and back on the Dreamliner paid for extra legroom seats both ways 30b and 30c. A nightmare both ways could not stretch our legs these seats are beside the toilets and our feet were trodden on for the flight out and the flight back. At one point we had 8 people standing over us waiting for the toilets. When I complained to Thomson I was told we got what we paid for and they were not responsible for other passengers behaviour. So these seats are to be avoided at all costs.

We just arrived back from Gran Canaria - Las Palmas from London Gatwick. Flight 4141 on 10/02/2014. The weather obviously plays a big part in inflight comfort. Both us being nervous flyers it's important to us we get a smooth journey. We have to say on the outward bound journey we were well informed by the flight deck of any potential turbulent air it turned out there really wasn't any to speak of. The actual cabin crew were friendly efficient and cheerful. The return flight again had happy staff in the cabin and organised and informative flight crew. The usual route back would have been along the coast of Portugal but due to the ever freakish weather the captain informed us of a detour inland then during the flight again he avoided what looked like some nasty turbulence. It did genuinely seem as if this particular flight crew were concerned about passenger comfort. It was well received.

13 Jan 2014 Gatwick to Mombasa - TOM076. 28 Jan 2014 Mombasa to Gatwick - TOM077. On the way out we sat in seats 30B and 30C which were by the toilets. We had paid £180 each way for extra leg room. It was an overnight flight and the whole time people were queuing for the toilets - the door slamming and toilet flushing each time someone used them with the resultant unpleasant smells or people were just stood around chatting to stretch their legs. People constantly stood on or tripped over our feet as we tried to sleep. We could not eat our meal because of the awful odours coming from the toilets. On the way back we sat in row 10 extra leg room and away from the toilets - this journey was absolutely fine as were all others aspects of the flight. On our return we complained to Thomson who just stated - you paid for extra leg room which you got - not a very satisfactory response. However as I say the other aspects of the flight - the staff food seat comfort and flights being on time - were fine. Do not sit in row 30! A nice plane but with a few teething problems.

My wife and I flew on the Thomson Dreamliner - Gatwick to Puerto Plata (and back). We reserved seats 39G / J for both legs of our trip. These are great little seats despite the decrease recline. You still get more of a recline than you would on a normal flight so it's OK. The only issue is if the person in front of you reclines fully then the screen is at a slightly funky position. Both flights were pretty smooth (a little turbulence) and very comfortable. The food was decent - nothing spectacular but decent. We got 2 meals on both legs of the journey. Crew on the outbound flight were pretty poor - only did one run for drinks and had no authority - to the point where one man was standing up during landing. The flight home was shorter than scheduled which was appreciated and the lighting was very subtle. Really enjoyed both flights and look forward to flying the Dreamliner again.

### Thomson Airways customer review
I will never use this company again after flying from Manchester to Montego Bay and paying for Premium Upgrade I was disgusted the seats were shabby the entertainment system kept breaking down and the drinks service was non existent. On the return flight the arm of my seat fell apart. I for one will never use Thomson again.

### Thomson Airways customer review
We used the Dreamliner from Gatwick to Phuket Thailand. The Dreamliner is a superb plane and the jet lag was minimised. Our complaint is the stub for screens etc which is between each passenger and projects too far toward the seat in front and makes for a very difficult exit to the toilet etc. Everyone seemed to mention this and although the staff were sympathetic this design needs urgent re-styling considering the extra charged. I also felt that the food was not up to scratch particularly on the return journey. I always highly rated Thomson food but not on this occasion. Most people seemed to think that with the introduction of the Deamliner this was a golden opportunity lost to upgrade the safety video and get rid of "that precocious child. I do hope that when we use Thomson again possibly to Thailand then the Premium seat problem will have been sorted.

Flight number TOM4666 on 25th January to Sofia - took off on time. After 1 hour in the sky the captain informed us of a small technical problem and that we have to land in Munich. After 10 minutes we were landing in Munich. Having spent 4 hours in Munich airport we were informed that the technical issue was not resolved and we could not continue our journey. We were offered overnight accommodation. Next day after again 1.5 hours delay we finally took off and reached our destination. This awful experience was then followed by next delay on the return flight from Sofia TOM4667 on 1st February. Two hours were crucial for us as we could not reach our home due to plane landing after midnight. We had no other choice as to spend the night at the airport. Meanwhile we also tried to speak to Thomson staff at the airport with no result and no apology. Flying with Thomson was one of the most unpleasant experiences with airlines. Will definitely avoid them in the future.

Dreamliner LGW-GOA in premium cabin. Definitely not worth the extra £900 priority boarding at Gatwick and priority luggage off on return to Gatwick was good. Service out to Goa was good lovely food lots of drinks services tea coffee etc. nice crew out (Gatwick based) return journey crew were miserable (except for a good lady in premium) food was awful and inedible. Ran out of various drinks. Hardly any cabin services (and I didn't want alcohol just water and tea etc. Sat in two seats together each way. Fine until the seats in front recline and the person by the window has to climb over the person next to them. Poor designed windows which even on darkest setting let the blinding sun through. Lots of the chairs look shabby already and the arm rests sunk in when you leant on them. two toilets in cabin but the economy pax kept coming in to use them. On the good side go in economy in the extra leg room seats. Felt no jet lag either way. We hit fast head winds and a jet stream on the return journey but the turbulence was definitely diminished by the plane. A beautiful plane but was a bit disappointed I think the crew on the return journey really let it down.

Flew on the new Dreamliner aircraft from Gatwick to the Maldives on 12 January 2014. This is a very quiet aircraft even on takeoff. The Premier Club cabin was spacious and there was plenty of legroom between seats. The inflight service provided on both the outward and return flights was excellent. The crew in both directions were professional and attentive. Food was generally very good in particular the main meals on each flight. Numerous drink rounds were carried out throughout the flights. The IFE worked well although the choice of films on offer I felt was not that great. The system is all touch screen with quality headphones which produced a great sound for both the films and music channels. Overall this was a very pleasant charter flight and we really had no complaints at all. This aircraft claims to reduce jet lag and I have to say we have never felt so good as we did after the 10 hour flight so I believe the claim to be correct.

Our first flight to Kenya on the Dreamliner 787 Dec 10th 2013. All cabin staff welcoming and helpful. Flight started off on time but due to people arriving late and luggage going missing we sat on the Tarmac for nearly an hour before we took off. Flight went smoothly and was non eventful. We were in premium class and seats were comfortable and leg room more than adequate. Only gripe was that the centre arm rest which stored the screens stuck out making it difficult to manoeuvre when people in front had their seats reclined. Usually feel rubbish for first few days on arrival in Kenya but can honestly say I didn't have that jet lagged feeling this time. The flight back on 24th Dec was as equally comfortable. Again all cabin staff friendly and hard working. Slight problem with water leaking but that soon stopped once we were airborne. Again flight went smoothly with no problems. Plenty of duty fees available on flight back. The food was edible on both flights and drinks were constantly flowing. We had to disembark at south terminal due to flooding in north terminal. That was a nightmare and took 1.5 hrs to get suitcases. No announcements made so it was a case of wait and see. We enjoyed our Dreamliner experience.

Just arrived from Phuket on the Dreamliner 23/1/2014 TOM 095. Nice aircraft but poor seat layout and mentioned by other reviewers constant queue for the wcs flushing for 12.5 hours not nice.

We flew to Barbados on the Dreamliner. On both legs of the journey there was a constant queue for the toilets sometimes six deep. The design of the plane puts the obvious place to queue opposite the toilet doors but Thomson sell this space as extra leg room. You are asked to queue in the narrow aisles which is a serious squash. Thomson like to sell drinks first so we were prevented from sleeping during the 8 hour return flight by having to wait nearly three hours for a poor meal then the usual attempt to sell duty free goods. The cabin lights were finally dimmed four hours and fifty minutes into the flight. When you are landing at five in the morning and facing a drive home this is Thomson putting profit ahead of comfort and safety.

LGW-SID-LGW flight 612/613. Out on 9/1 and back on 16/1. Flew old B757 which going out was spotlessly clean and found the seat pitch just about bearable. I'm just over 6'2" but object to paying the ridiculous amount they were asking for extra legroom - talk about squeezing every last penny they can out of you! The crew were excellent really happy and friendly and made the 6 hour flight seem to go very quickly. Food was pretty good but if they offer you a free hot meal why not include tea/coffee. Seemed a bit penny-pinching. Coming home old and tired ex- First Choice B757 and despite having exactly the same seats the leg room was much worse. The crew did their job but for a lot of flight were behind the curtain in the forward galley. Very uncomfortable and cramped flight home. Find easyJet much better aircraft much more pleasant to fly on and not such a rip off if you want to pay for extra leg room. Shame they don't fly to Cape Verde!

### Thomson Airways customer review
Cabin crew were awful no eye contact. I had a window seat and unless you was in an aisle seat you missed out. Food was inedible throughout the flight. I choose this flight as I thought it would be so much better than travelling to Heathrow and changing at Bangkok as I do this trip alone but I was wrong I'd much rather do that than go on the Dreamliner. They could learn a lot from Air Asia their service is second to none.

We flew to Phuket with Thomson on December 24th from Gatwick's North Terminal. We awoke at our hotel to news we should check in early to poor weather. We arrived at the north Terminal and could only just get in due to the queues .We queued for 3 hours with no communication from Thomson or anyone. The systems were down and we can understand that. After 3 hours we finally arrived at the next check in and were told to go to the South terminal? Those further to the back of the queue could transfer over easier and we ended up at the back of the queue at the South Terminal. 2 hours later we checked in. Still no communication from anyone from Thomson. After another 2 hours or so at the gate and many people losing the plot. There was a situation at the gate where make shift check in staff were arguing with passengers and these were giving their time and they were not from Thomson doing their best (Monarch I think). Yet again there were no Thomson staff giving any feedback or help whatsoever! We ended up boarding and going by bus to meet our aircraft and leaving at least 4 holiday makers missing their flight.

I flew to Punta Cana (PUJ) from LGW. We were told that we would be flying on the new 787-8 Dreamliner and with its surrounded hype from the airline had given its newest addition to its fleet as 'impressive. To comment on the service received outbound and inbound is quite mixed leaving London to Dominican Republic the flight was easy seats acceptable but the IFE is very limited which one would expect from a charter airline. I just wished that the staff were more 'willing' to help please don't get me wrong I am not criticising their ability to do their job's I am sure they are more than capable when they have a good attitude. With such a brand new aircraft being the showpiece in Thomson's fleet I would have expected a 'first rate service. I partly echo that statement on the return journey back to London the crew was short due to a crew member being taken 'ill' so cabin service was reduced or seemed slower than normal. Turning this into a positive they did the best of a difficult situation and carried out their jobs with a smile much more warming and friendly than the inbound trip. Rating the food isn't really something I want to moan about continuously but even for airline food the standard is pretty poor not something I would find appealing nor would I receive say on British Airways flying to e.g. Cancun. I haven't flown with Thomson before but knowing what I know even though the airline got me to my destination safely it just feel that they have all the right tools e.g. new aircraft willing staff but they need to be utilised a bit more tactfully in gaining more willing and paying clients.

Went to Thailand on the new Dreamliner and was thoroughly disappointed food was awful the cabin crew were so disinterested - no eye contact so having a window seat was a nightmare. I would rather travel with Air Asia and change at Bangkok the service was excellent.

Thomson Fly: Flew NCL-TFS-NCL. Out 24/12/13 back 3/1/14 so very surprised by the changes in a Thomson cabin. Haven't flown on Thomson for years new B737/800 and leg room! Still over priced food but staff very good both ways on time also both ways. Again so pleased we did not get one of the old B757 so hope this becomes the norm it is long time over due as old planes give wrong impression of the UK top holiday company. We asked for 12e/f no problems at all.

We just returned from the Dominican Republic on the Dreamliner we had pre-booked leg room seats in row 30. This we found was a waste of money as any extra room you had was full of people queuing for the toilets anyway also the extra legroom seats in the middle of row 30 the passengers kept getting trodden on. The smell from the toilet was awful. If you want extra legroom try row 10 it may be better. The seats to me are smaller in width and very hard so not very comfortable. This aircraft is faster saving at least 30-45 mins flying time compared to the older 767s.

We flew from Gatwick to La Palma on 6th December. First there is the combined check-in. Only 5kg hand luggage per person not one bag between two weighing under 10kg. More than my jobs worth we were told. Everyone in the queue was re-packing their luggage causing long delays as only 4 counters open. Then onto an elderly 757 - only 93 of us on a plane with 220 seats! Return was similar at check-in in La Palma all passengers wearing coats and jumpers to avoid the same problem but the counter people did not bother about hand luggage. What a farce. Thomson Airways has now gone onto our Ryanair list - never again!

Flew from Manchester to Cancun Mexico on 4th December 2013. Upon take off water came flooding in over people. We were sat in seats 37. Obviously concerned with all the previous troubles the Dreamliner has experienced people started to panic. The staff were unhelpful advising that this was normal from the air/conditioning system. People were soaked and the overhead compartments had previously been stuffed with tissue paper to top it all the aircraft crew simply gave people mounds of tissue paper and were very unhelpful and not sympathetic at all. Food was terrible. We had a 40min wait on the runway when landing in Cancun. Never again.

Good experience with Thomson Airways travelling on the Dreamliner. The cabin crew were professional polite and helpful. I'm a nervous flier and the flight deck crew made me feel safe with regular updates about the flight and timings etc. The plane food was tasty and the tea/coffee included with the meal was both welcome and a surprise as we thought we had to pay for all beverages. The only thing that didn't make it excellent was having to pay for snacks and drinks in between meals. Aside from that it was up there near Emirates on service and product (the best I've experienced). If only they hadn't marketed the food with the label "economy club". The complimentary daily mail on the way back was a nice touch as I was desperate to find out what was going on in the world. We flew economy so were surprised. The inflight entertainment was okay. A better selection of music and movies could improve this. Pleasantly surprised all in all and would definitely use them again.

We flew the new Boeing Dreamliner Manchester to Barbados to join a P&O cruise ship it was superb just 7.5 hours out and 6.5 hours returning. 41000ft at speeds up to 650 mph. The service was good the food better on the outbound not wonderful but good. However the design of the seating whilst very comfortable made exiting when the flat screens employed virtually impossible. Finding the control and call buttons is also a challenge. The choice of in flight entertainment was very limited in particular music. We are used to Emirates economy where there is just so much choice. We have been back in the UK for a few days now and the jet lag does not seem as bad as previously.

### Thomson Airways customer review
MAN-CUN-MAN B787 Dreamliner Economy Class both ways. Inflight Entertainment good crew / service good. Slightly better outbound than inbound. Food perfectly acceptable - hot and tasty. Coffee served with meal is lousy though. Only gripe is that seats are too narrow (I'm average build but sat in the middle seat for 8 hours plus through the night is uncomfortable and claustrophobic - especially when seat in front is reclined).

TOM810/1 LGW-HRG-LGW. After reading reviews we weren't exactly looking forward to our 5hrs plus flight to Egypt. Both flights on a B737-800 and just 5 empty seats outbound and a full flight on the return. It really wasn't that bad. Legroom wasn't as tight as I expected and perfectly ok for my 5ft 11ins. Crew worked hard and considering the long flights (they don't stop over but return straight way) did very well. Food and drink payable on board very similar to a LCC now. I would have preferred a meal service given the length of this flight.

Flew from Cancun to LGW on flight TOM 063 which was scheduled to depart Cancun at 16.20 hrs local time 1/11/13 but due to as yet proved reasons did not depart until 13.05hrs the following day 2/11/13 - a delay of nearly 21 hours. Together with another flight TOM195 to Manchester due to fly 17.00hrs on 1/11/13 but flew 11.30 hrs 2/11/13 we were eventually transferred to the Riu Palace Peninsular for overnight stay having stood at Cancun airport for 7 hours! Blame for delay of both flights according to Thomson staff was that check-in was prevented by SITA or US TSA failing to confirm passenger details since aircraft flew over US airspace although staff admitted that Thomson failed to send info on time &/or that info had errors. On top of that delay with all the to-ing and fro-ing then the crew were timed out! On our eventual flight as we were getting settled in our seats guess what one of flight staff asked us to do - you guessed it please fill your questionnaire about our holiday experience! The food was pretty disappointing too!

Uncomfortable dirty aircraft. No food or drink when delayed and no compensation due to hiding behind "exceptional circumstances".

Flew BHX-SIN-BHX on 757-200 in row 20 outbound and row 25 inbound. Far too cramped and claustrophobic for a 6 hour flight. Impossible to get comfortable in the seat or walk down the aisle without tripping over someone's foot and hitting someone's knee or elbow. I'm 5'2" and small and I had trouble moving around. There was no entertainment of any description which just isn't good enough for a flight that long. The food wasn't great but edible and if you wanted to drink anything with the meal you had to buy it. The crew was a mixture of those who seemed to enjoy their job and others who would rather have been elsewhere. They ran out of most duty free items on the inbound journey. I wouldn't choose to fly with Thomson again unless they invest more in their ageing fleet and inflight entertainment.

### Thomson Airways customer review
BHX - HRG B757-200. I pre purchased extra legroom seats (row 8) as I had flown on this type of aircraft before and found the seats very tight for a 5 hour plus journey. Well worth the extra as I had at least 36in legroom. The outbound flight left 3 mins early and arrived 10 mins early similar coming back. Yes there was a bit of sell sell sell but I suppose they need to make some money. Overall a good experience with the extra legroom seats and wouldn't hesitate to book again.

TOM5678/5679 Luton-Las Palmas-Luton. Aircraft both ways was a 737-800 with the return aircraft being only a few months old. Outward flight left on time & the cabin crew were friendly and efficient. Flight deck crew both ways were fantastic and very informative about our flight and routing. PA was very loud which was great as I enjoy listening to updates from the flight deck. Legroom good on both sectors. Return flight 30 mins late departing but no fault of Thomson just volume of traffic at Las Palmas. Hot food purchased on board was nice and drinks services were frequent for a short haul flight. Overall very impressed with Thomson.

### Thomson Airways customer review
We flew back from Mexico Cancun on 26/11 sat in 37 E above the seat tissue paper was shoved into the roof it was slowly dripping water. On take off as the aircraft leans back water rushes out and pours over me and the passenger in front. Alerted the cabin crew they simply said it was the condensation on the air conditioning due to the heat of Mexico no apology. Asked to report to maintenance staff the cabin crew outright refused saying it wasn't a maintenance issue it was normal for the aircraft to do that. Seating is very cramped cabin crew look untidy and have a terrible attitude toward passengers. Food was ok to poor out bound was better than in bound meal. Entertainment was the only decent thing with plenty of films to watch. Would strongly recommend people to consider other travel providers before using Thomson.

### Thomson Airways customer review
We have just travelled to the Maldives on the 787 Dreamliner. We sat in row 35. I think there is a definite design fault with this aircraft. The toilets are at the back which were fine but the ones at row 30 have not been logically placed. They serve everyone in the middle section of the aircraft and people in the low to mid 30's look forward and see these ones rather than the rear ones. On our night flight out theses new loud super flushing toilets with their noisy pivot doors were in constant use. The constant whooshing of the loos and banging of the doors could be heard all night from row 35 goodness knows how cross the people who paid for extra leg room in row 30 must gave felt. As if this wasn't enough of a noise the cabin crew obviously had lost something as with a small light they proceeded to open every single overhead storage compartment and close it 3 times during the night I guess it was the forms you fill in to gain access to the Maldives as they announced they had run out before we landed. I also feel that although the leg room is good the width room didn't feel very spacious and due to the configuration of 3x3x3 there were a lot of people who I guess hadn't booked seats together who were across isles or one behind each other for the flight. The captains messages were also not very loud and clear so you couldn't always hear what had been said. A positive thing the new design windows that black out are great.

### Thomson Airways customer review
Myself and my husband recently travelled from Manchester to Cancun on the Dreamliner - TOM 144 26 October. The flight itself was great ie entertainment comfort and the cabin crew were very pleasant. We were absolutely disgusted though with the standard of food offered. The main meal was a chicken and rice dish which was awful but the teatime cheese and pickle ploughman's on some sort of bread was absolutely disgusting. It really turned my stomach and my husband refused to eat his as well. The flight was 10 hours long so I would have expected a better standard of food with the money we paid. On return TOM145 9 November - the food was not much better. The best part was the bacon sandwich for breakfast just before landing at Manchester. Thomson are letting themselves down.

### Thomson Airways customer review
Travelled out from LGW last Sunday. Aircraft was late boarding (20 minute ). Once on board we were We flew as 'flight only' passengers: EMA-ALC-EMA; travelling to own apartment so no hold baggage whatsoever. Dismayed that even for this travel status there was no on-line checking facility. The weight and size restriction was adhered to (5kgs so quite limited compared to most) however as a result many essential items such as documents were ultimately (and accidently) left at home so as to avoid problems and embarrassment. Arrived to check in for this early flight and discovered that majority of passengers had cabin baggage that deserved to be in the hold and appeared not to be checked for size and weight. Rules need to be consistent across the board with this airline regardless of your travel status. On-line check in would be a good idea too! Overall cabin crew were fairly good.

### Thomson Airways customer review
Travelled out from LGW last Sunday. Aircraft was late boarding (20 minute ). Once on board we were informed by the captain that we were still refuelling and this would take another 20 minutes. Once this had bee completed we were then told of a further 20 minute delay as they were waiting for a spare part to take on our flight to Mali. This delay turned I to a 1 hour and 30 minute hold up stuck on the plane! I travel frequently and I have to say that Thomson are really going down hill. Staff only interested in trying to sell the duty free.

### Thomson Airways customer review
My husband and I travelled on our 5th flight in 3 years with Thomson from Birmingham to Rhodes and the outbound flight was a complete shambles. We purchased extra leg room seats at the airport and these were located at the front of the plane. Immediately upon boarding the cabin manager exclaimed that Thomson really shouldn't sell those seats as they were in her workspace so we could get a lot of disturbance - very professional of her! 30 minutes into the flight a cabin crew member was taken ill and was seated in the kitchen area in front of us and opposite the toilet. We were then all told we could no longer use that toilet because it impinged on her privacy and had to use the one's located the other end of the plane. Okay but the way the crew spoke to passengers who were queuing was an utter disgrace they were so rude. We had paid over £1000 for our seats and were spoken to as if we were just a complete nuisance for wanting basic needs to be met. There were 2 crew members looking after the one taken ill and service in the cabin was severely inhibited because of this and passengers were unable to obtain food and drink and told to stay seated. The Cabin manager told us that the reason her colleague had been taken ill was because she had been doing a fasting diet - very irresponsible when she had duty of care to hundreds of passengers at 37000 feet! When we were due to land I was told I needed to move from my seat so that the ill crew member could be seated near the exit for landing and I was hurriedly escorted to a crew seat at the back of the plane and told to leave my belongings because I could get them later. I was given no assistance to get back to my seat my husband and my belongings when the plane landed and this was virtually impossible to do with all the passengers blocking the aisle. My husband did not realise I had put the books purchased at the airport to enjoy on my holiday in the overhead locker and subsequently they got left behind. My complaint to Thomson took 2 months to get a response and their reply was inadequate. It appears that customer service comes way down the list of their priorities and we will not travel with Thomson again.

Travelled on the Dreamliner from East Midlands to Cancun 16/10/2013 and returned 31/10/13 fantastic plane smooth flight mood lighting reflects the time of day / night and didn't suffer with much jet lag after return. Lots of room in economy and I'm glad I didn't upgrade to cabin plenty of entertainment to choose from seat back touch screen TV and excellent food and service. Can't wait to book up and fly on the Dreamliner again.

GLA-LPA 25th Oct. A very poor service both outward and on return from grumpy and disinterested cabin crew who were clearly just doing the bare minimum. Cabin service on short haul services now reduced to those offered by Ryanair - i.e. sell sell sell. Vastly over priced "snack boxes" replace the meal service. A scone and a cheap teacake is GBP 4 a box containing processed plastic cheese two mini crispbreads and a tiny packet of crisps is £4.50. I was overcharged for the "meals" by the cabin manager and when complained the refund was given with little more than a insincere "sorry". Ageing grubby 757 no inflight entertainment a new inflight magazine that does not contain any articles apart from Thomson propaganda crew that couldn't care less. Will I choose Thomson again for short haul - why bother - they clearly don't.

Travelled to Cyprus from Manchester on 13th October Package holiday. Flight out was on Dreamliner we found this to be a great experience: more leg room- fantastic in-flight entertainment fresh toilets quiet flight air levels more comfortable. No such luck on the return flight we came back to earth with a bump! The flight was pleasant enough but didn't compare to Dreamliner. No entertainment on 5 hour flight leg room ok toilets not so fresh 'heavy' air in cabin itched most of way home. Cabin crew were hard working on both flights wouldn't like their job trying to deal with a few unreasonable customers!

Flew MAN-IBZ-MAN on TOM2322/2323 on the Boeing 757-200 which was the exact aircraft going as coming back. The cabin crew were pleasant and welcomed each passenger on board and pointing out which way each passenger was seated. Leg room was fair but for a 2 hour 30 min flying time it didn't bother me but any longer would have presented a problem. If flying long haul the leg room wouldn't be ideal to places such as SID etc. IFE seemed to be TVs that were overhead but due to the shortness of flight were not used. The cabin service was adequate however everything you had to pay an inflated price for but not as bad as Ryanair etc. Flight deck announcements were great and kept the cabin up to date including cruising altitudes and route information with weather information also. Overall the Thomson B757-200 is a great aircraft however would only be ideal for me flying 3 hours or less unless the seat pitch was improved like other airlines.

MAN-TFS B767-300. Was meant to be on the dreamliner but wasn't due to technical faults with the aircraft. The crew explained the situation really well and we departed on time. There was plenty of legroom and the cabin service was fantastic. I purchased a Bacon Sandwich which was really tasty. The captain made frequent announcements and updated us on any progress made. Very smooth flight with brilliant landing and takeoff. Crew were really friendly and helpful throughout. Outbound fantastic. TFS-MAN B787-800. The dreamliner aircraft was out of this world. It really puts the customer at heart and fuels all the senses. We departed on time and landed on time. The cabin service was excellent again and the captain made regular announcements. Very smooth flight. Inbound fantastic. I would definitely recommend Thomson.

Just flown back from Sanford Orlando on the new Dreamliner. Lovely aircraft lots of legroom in economy cabin felt very fresh the mood lighting is very different food was good. Air crew very nice. Didn't seem to suffer as much jet lag this time must be due to the cabins having far more oxygen.

LGW-MAH return. Out on an older B737-800 very cramped seating luckily no one in front so no reclining issues. Return on newer version of same plane much more leg room aircraft about half full. Both legs on time cabin crew good. Did not purchase any food or drinks. Would not wish to travel very long on older aircraft. Used these flights as part of a villa package so no choice of carrier.

9 hour 51 min delay at Gatwick Dreamliner had air conditioning fault - TOM62 11th Oct. No proper information. Constant requests for updates ignored. Eventually offered meal voucher had to join line straggling across main departure area while one person handed out voucher after checking ticket and boarding pass. Eventually took off after replacement standard plane flew in from Manchester. First thing crew did was start selling tea and coffee. 25th Oct Cancun TOM63 Dreamliner another fault. 1 hour 30 min delay. Minimum information minimum concern from staff. Eventually took off. First thing crew started selling. One toilet in economy not working stewards refused to let people use premium loos. Cups marked economy in large print so we did not drink from premier ones. 11 hour flight was made a misery each way by Thomson disgusting attitude to customers.

### Thomson Airways customer review
Went on a Thomson cruise holiday which flew into and out of Pathos Cyprus. The aircraft was a Thomson marked modern Boeing 737-800. No problem with the plane as such but we were crammed into a small seating arrangement both ways. Our biggest gripe is the lack of customer care taken by the airline with regards health. It seems Thomson no longer let any fresh air into the cabins but other than the minimum requirement but just re-circulate the stale air on board. This leads to lots of people getting what's known as "Cabin Cough". They do this as it costs them extra money to circulate fresh air from outside in fuel costs. They are not alone many other airlines are now doing this it seems. This results in many of their passengers getting cold like symptoms.

Birmingham to Mahon and back (9-16th). The plane was a little dated and the seats were tightly packed together in a 3-3 formation. The plane was due to take off at 7.15 however due to a passenger becoming ill we had to wait for paramedics which meant we didn't take off until 8.10. The cabin crew were excellent dealing with the unfortunate ill passenger and constantly keeping the rest of us informed. Once in the air we were served hot food then drinks then duty free sales. There is no inflight entertainment on these short haul flights but this didn't bother me. The food was averagely priced for an airplane. The seats were cramped and had little leg room but I didn't find this an issue as the flight was only 2 hours long. As a nervous flyer I felt totally safe and comfortable with the outbound flight. Coming back was a different story. Once we were started boarding the plane the cabin crew were running around laughing joking and generally being unprofessional. I didn't feel safe in their hands whatsoever. Once in the air I ordered a drink for a woman to practically throw my change in my face. After I muttered she rudely snapped at me saying 'we are busy. You're not the only passenger who wants a drink'. All in all I would probably recommend Thomson for the simple fact that they do decent flights at decent prices. It's just a shame that the cabin crew on the returning flight weren't as nice as the ones from the outbound flight.

Flew back to London Luton from Dalaman in Turkey. The problem was not with the flight itself but the way Thomson uses Dalaman airport. They land about 9 aircraft within minutes of each other and they all (attempt!) to take off again within minutes of each other and the Airport simply cannot cope. The problem arises with the aircraft using remote parking spots on the airport apron. Passengers for these are shunted off into the suffocating basement of the terminal where there are about six gates with nowhere near enough room to accommodate passengers. So you get families with young children sitting on the floor and being treated like cattle. It's human nature - certainly amongst the British - to start forming queues which bear no relationship to the order in which the flights depart. One gate was being used for two different flights. There were no announcements from the departure gate staff even though some flights were delayed without any reference to it on the screens. Such confusion can lead to panic and stress situations - what a way to treat your customers! When we eventually got in a bus - the driver had no idea which aircraft he was supposed to decant us to - he had a choice of nine! When we eventually departed an hour late and after such a stressful boarding process there was not a hint of an apology from the Captain. Mind you he couldn't even remember the name of his Cabin Supervisor. All in all - pretty shambolic.

### Thomson Airways customer review
We flew back from Cancun to Birmingham on 5th October 2013. The outbound flight was good but the inbound flight was awful and not up to standard. We had paid the extra to Premium Club seats and was very disappointed. The entertainment did not work and we were unable to have the menu of our choice and was offered the economy menu as an alternative. The reading light did not work and with no entertainment it made the 10 hour flight extremely long and boring. The cabin crew were very friendly and helpful on the outbound flight but were less so on the inbound flight. Duty free was nearly non existent but there was sales pressure to buy the limited options available. We were advised by the cabin manager to put in a complaint. We had a a lovely holiday but the edge was taken off it by the very poor flight home.

### Thomson Airways customer review
We flew from Manchester to Sanford premium economy on 4th October - I was a little apprehensive after reading some of these reviews but we have no complaints whatsoever! My husband is 6ft tall and he sat in the window seat because I tend to fidget and like to move around - yes the armrest sticks out but no one seemed to have a problem! The crew were absolutely brilliant and couldn't do enough for us the food was delicious compared to some other carriers - it was lovely to be treated like adults with proper cutlery etc and it gave it that special touch. It's obviously a personal choice to go premium to pay that bit extra for the extra service and I wouldn't have been impressed if the rest of the aircraft passengers would've come through to use the toilets in premium cabin. We came back on the dreamliner a week later on the 11th October - we had different seats on the way back but still no complaints. Again the crew were fab - nothing was too much trouble for them they were very chatty whilst still being professional and I wouldn't hesitate to travel with Thomson again. People may say we 'fell lucky' after reading their reviews and the bad time they had but we're thoroughly satisfied with the aircraft and service and will be booking again soon. My only complaint is that our holiday didn't last long enough!

### Thomson Airways customer review
EMA-Sanford in premium on the Dreamliner. We had a pleasant flight both outward and inbound on the 787 dreamliner. It is a spacious comfortable aircraft the seats and legroom are very good whilst sitting but not that great when trying to sleep due to the lack of recline. They are also awkward to squeeze past if you have a window seat due to the centre console. The food and beverages served were reasonable. The cabin crew were good offering an efficient service. In my opinion a service that is at least as good as Virgin premium economy at a cheaper rate.

### Thomson Airways customer review
Gatwick to Larnaca Cyprus 18 Sep 2013 for flight only. As we thought seat pitch would be similar to Easyjet Aer Lingus and Ryanair we did not book premier seating. Wrong decision. We were right at the back of an old 757 in row 36. At 6'4" I could just get into the seat but could not sit back so stood until just before take off. A steward noticed me and after being told the seating was unacceptable arranged for alternative seating once airborne. Better. My wife at 5'5" could just sit down but uncomfortably. The seats had been crammed together so the pitch was too short. The seats were also narrower and the other 3 in our party had an uncomfortable flight out. During our week away I was constantly fretting about the flight back so the holiday was less than restful. On returning to Larnaca for the flight back we arrived early and the Thomson staff tried to convince us that the seat pitch was the same for Easyjet etc and we had not been relegated to the back as we had booked a flight only. They failed on both counts. However we then booked 2 premier seats as no more were available so the 2 men had plenty of legroom but no better seat width while our wives behind us had to suffer our seats reclining on their own. We were again in the back of the aircraft. The seats were uncomfortable as any padding had long since been compacted. Many other passengers in the back agreed they were much too restricted.

### Thomson Airways customer review
Flew Birmingham to Sanford. Upgraded to premium but it was not worth the extra money. The seat base was like sitting on a plank of wood no padding and really uncomfortable. If you suffer with lower back problems or sciatica you will probably be in pain after 8 hours. The back of the seat and the head rest were fine just strange that they had not put padding in the seats! There is more than enough leg room though so that was good. The width didn't feel any bigger than normal and the worst thing was the armrests were hard plastic and after an hour I had to pad them both using the blankets they gave us. Not impressed. The entertainment was ok but the system was temperamental and kept stopping the films. Although the cabin crew did apologize not really their fault though. The food however was really nice. I don't know if it was a difference to standard but we enjoyed it. Overall though I wouldn't bother upgrading - waste of money.

### Thomson Airways customer review
Gatwick to Aruba August 2013. Outward flight was good and worth the upgrade price. Staff on outward trip were very good and food entertainment and service very good. The return trip unfortunately takes our rating right down. Food was overheated and dry. Wine served after the meal had been eaten and roll served after the meal. Only one hot drink offered. Staff seemed more bothered about getting duty free goods sold. Rubbish and survey form not collected on our row. Ran out of orange juice at breakfast serving and given plastic cutlery (not usual in premium class). The return trip experience means that we would not travel premium with Thomson again. Probably just as well to just book extra leg room seats in economy class.

Bristol to Sharm el Sheikh - Sept 2012. Plane left on time - but 5-6 hours without onboard meal or entertainment is not my idea of good service. They have plenty of time to go up the plane selling you drinks and duty free so what's the problem with serving a meal. No storage on back of seat in front of you and very little room for the tray to come down. I shall avoid Thomson short haul in the future.

### Thomson Airways customer review
Gatwick to Sanford out 21st Sep return 3rd October on Dreamliner. From moment of booking holiday to flight just a bad experience. Have flown Thomson before upgrading to premium which was good this time thought we would not bother upgrading because seats were bigger and we had booked extra legroom seats - economy in Dreamliner is not my idea of comfort. We sat in row 10 and that is just behind premium seats. In premier seating they have two toilets for roughly 70 people we were told we could not use toilets just in front of us. Staff are constantly up and down plane with trolley you can not get past I was queuing for toilets with 3 other people when flight attendant said can you use toilet in row 40 so I did and on way back got stuck outside toilets with 3 other people and flight attendant said can you not congregate outside toilets. Food was dreadful going out was chicken rice in mushroom sauce it was disgusting and none of us ate it. Later on we got a mini Milky Way. On way home we had beef cobbler that was not too bad and a Danish pastry with smoothie. Would never do long haul with Thomson again.

### Thomson Airways customer review
Very poor customer communication and information in flight from Sharm el Sheikh to Edinburgh on 5/10/2013. Flight was delayed but no info provided in the terminal. Once on board could sense strange attitude amongst the cabin crew but they waited till the flight was about to leave before letting us know that we were being diverted to Newcastle because of runway work at Edinburgh. No information on why Newcastle not Glasgow which is considerably closer. No information on expected arrival time in Edinburgh taking account of bus journey from Newcastle. No decent opportunity to let people collecting at Edinburgh (taxis family) know of delay which given 02.45 arrival time was very worrying for people. No additional food or drinks provided even though the overall delay was 4 hours. During the flight the cabin crew were very inattentive instead talking with each other almost non-stop and at one point all moving to the forward area to talk. The curtain does not mask noise and for those of us near the front it was impossible to sleep due to the cabin crew being so selfish. The cabin crew kept going on about how they were affected by the outgoing flight being 1 hour late and failed to see the customer perspective since we faced a bus transfer and a 4 hour delay. They are paid to do their job which includes customer service. They made 1 trip through with the drinks trolley then each announcement focused on their offers of scratchcard duty free and then charity collection. One of the worst crews I have ever seen in action.

LGW to ACE 22nd Sept Tom4766. Check in was quick and efficient departed on time from there everything went downhill. A full cabin no seat choice offered no food distributed no drinks distributed all required either advance or in flight payment on a nearly a four hour flight. This is as close as I have come to being treated like cattle I was made to feel guilty when I asked asking for a fruit juice or a drink of water. Crew very nonchalant addressing my wife and myself as Guys or me as Mate which I wasn't. Also very intent on emptying their trolley this was stacked with paper cups containing tea and coffee or a pre-packaged food menu which most people left scratch cards & some charity nonsense was thrown into the mix. Boeing 737-800 very noisy cabin in comparison to Airbus single aisles. Skipper provided excellent updates on flight progress and highlighted areas of interest first class. The name Thomson Airways is a contradiction in as much had I been transported on a cattle truck down the M1 for four hours I would likely by law have had better service never again.

Outbound LGW-Zante 20th Sep. Inbound Zante-LGW 1st October. Actually impressed on the two flights and very happy 737-800's both times were in good condition and comfortable in both instances. Cabin crew on both occasions were also friendly and did a good job especially with the young families aboard. Only poor condition of the cabin was actually due to infantile graffiti on backs of seats. However solid flights and would definitely use again.

ACE to LGW TOM4767 29th Sep. Return flight was in principle a repeat of the outward sector but his time we were more exhausted for hanging around hotel foyers most of the day. Check-in quick and efficient flight departed on time excellent flight progress updates from the skipper. A newer version of a 737-800 with irrelevant so called Mood Lighting but oh dear still that "Very Noisy" cabin the flight was a repeat of the outward in terms of none service & active selling by the crew from the trolley. Most people seemed to have become aware of this version of highway robbery so business wasn't so brisk. Thomson Airways are clearly a mover of people with little understanding of passenger wellbeing. Their one salvation is the highly innovative cabin safety video which provided brief amusement in what became another dismal flying experience.

LGW-KGS-LGW. Was not looking forward to this trip having read previous reviews! Late take-off due to aircraft late in from Ibiza plus techie with wheel replacement required at Gatwick but very informative pilot who kept us informed regularly at the gate. Clean new aircraft seat configuration tight but I guess that's charter for you. Everything chargeable on the flight but I didn't think (alcoholic) drinks cost unreasonable though a cup of tea on the return flight at GBP2.50 was a little bit steep! I ate at Gatwick on outward bound so cannot comment on food though menu clearly snack driven and probably not good value for money from what I saw. Cabin crew ok. All in all I can't complain about the flights. I was travelling flights only and only had cabin luggage so on that basis I was happy with the flights.

We flew on the new Dreamliner in premium on 19th September. We normally fly BA from Gatwick but could not be bothered with the 4 hr drive down but I wish I had. The crew on both flights were poor unprofessional and quite frankly Thomson needs to sort their customer service out. The premium seat were uncomfortable and my wife who is a size 10 could not get out of the middle seat when the front seat was reclined! How in an emergency would they get out! Overall very poor and would not use again.

I flew from Gatwick to Aruba in late June 2013. Flight took off exactly on time - flight staff were all very attentive and well mannered. Food and beverages were adequate given that we were traveling economy. My wife had a vegetarian option for her meal but said that it was unappetising. The seat back entertainment was mach appreciated on a 10 hour flight. I note quite a few negative reviews on here but honestly I would struggle to find any issues to raise.

My husband and I have been flying with Thomson for over 10 years and have experienced small planes big planes old planes. But have always felt safe (I'm nervous flyer). We got back from Zante 14th September on a new plane and went out on a new plane. A comfortable flight.

Travelled to Cuba on 3rd Sep 2013 from Manchester on flight TOM 122/3 returning on 17th Sep 2013. Both the outbound flight and the return flight were delayed 4 hours. We were not given a satisfactory reason just a £5 voucher - what a joke! We have flown with Thomson for years and were surprised to see just how much their service has deteriorated. Aircraft was freezing cold in both directions. We only had one very poor meal on the outbound flight and one even worse meal on the return plus a poor excuse for a breakfast - fruit smoothie and fruit Danish pastry. Only one drink was served during the 10 hours flight - which is disgusting. The cabin crew were not professional at all. They were only interested in trying to push duty free products. We can remember a time when cabin crew looked well groomed and professional. The aircraft's are old and dated and very uncomfortable especially for a long haul flight. Appalling service and Thomson should be ashamed of themselves. I believe that Thomson will no longer be flying to Cuba after April 2014 but they are not geared up for any long haul destination. We are looking at using Virgin next time.

### Thomson Airways customer review
Supposed to travel to Majorca on a Thomson flight ended up on a Jetair (Belgium airline) with a later flight time of approx 6 hours. No inflight entertainment except watching the cabin crew trying to interpret what passengers wanted to drink (poor English) no duty free no snacks available and on return flight a 'free for all when boarding leading to congestion on aircraft. This airline has same livery as Thomson but is a poor facsimile.

Looks as if I travelled on the same 787 Dreamliner as G Parkinson (16/09/2013) TOM 144 MAN to CUN. (14.09.2013) and return 21/09/2013 TOM 145. Though in economy with legroom of 33/34" both ways 13A/B outbound and 19A/B inward the flight was comfortable and crew both ways were excellent no problem sleeping on return as fortunately on both legs we had passengers in front who were not the selfish type insisting on reclining seats. The only reason I have downgraded food is because 1): being allergic to mushrooms the meal outbound was chicken a la king and stacked with mushroom (told by wife that it was very good) and 2) breakfast on return was very poor quality orange juice yoghurt and a block of bread/cake with no spread (most people seemed to leave this "appetizing dish").

Our flight to Paphos on 28th August was all going smoothly all passengers had boarded not by jetty but by having to walk across the tarmac. Everyone was on board the doors were closed and steps taken away before the scheduled time of departure and there we sat after about 10 minutes we were informed by the flight crew that we had missed our slot due to the unavailability of the push back tug and we would not be departing for 1 hour and 45 mins. The plane was eventually pushed back to a concrete stand in the middle of the airport and surround by barriers. We sat there for over an hour and were then informed that when the barriers were removed we would depart. This is not our first experience of delay with Thomson on flights to Cyprus. Our return flight times had been changed twice in a week which we found rather unusual as we were well into the season and would have thought that Thomson would have known there return flight times. In June we have another problem with a flight to Paphos when the computer required a part we were told as this was an old computer it would take time to reboot and so we sat again on the tarmac. What is the problem with Thomson flights to Paphos from Gatwick. As today my daughters flight to Paphos has yet again been delay for over an hour as of now I do not know the problem but when I do I will inform you. It seems that Thomson just want full flights and take any slot available that other Airlines refuse.

### Thomson Airways customer review
Flew with Thomson as part of package holiday from BHX to RHO and return. Booked extra legroom and very satisfied with the space provided. Both flights on B757 and on time return one had the old style seats thankfully now in dark blue leather instead of hideous bright green of First Choice. Outbound one of cabin crew was ill so spent last hour of flight stuck in seats. Return flight much better. Friendly captain who spent time talking to passengers in first 2/3 rows before takeoff then kept us entertained throughout the journey. Cabin crew very friendly possibly result of captain's attitude. The low scores are reflection of lack of proper food inflight entertainment and high costs relating to extra legroom seats and more luggage allowance. The "fast food" style catering is overpriced and smells horrible.

### Thomson Airways customer review
Friday 13th September. Flew back from Naples airport. Do not wish to repeat this experience in a hurry! Flight on way out okay however flight on way back was in an old 757 plane. Impossible to alter air conditioning during the flight which according to pilot was due to the old design of the plane! Several people complained about this. Worst part was the very long wait for any kind of customer service. After waiting for what seemed like hours for air hostesses to serve us we were kindly or not so kindly informed that they had run out of paninis and sandwiches and the only hot food available was soup or chips. Chocolate fingers and Pringles does not constitute a proper meal. Why can't we go back to the good old days where meals were included as part of the flying experience and you didn't have to pay extra to sit with the person you are travelling with or pay extra for going over the miserly 15kg limit for hold luggage. Think EasyJet now provide a better service than Thomsons and their luggage restrictions are not as bad as Thomson. How sad that a once great airline has been reduced to this! The current air hostesses could also certainly do with attending some kind of charm school and at least not be rude about the passengers until they have left the aircraft! Won't be flying with Thomson again in a hurry if I can help it.

### Thomson Airways customer review
TOM144 Manchester to Cancun. 787 Dreamliner Premium Club Cabin. An impressive modern new aircraft with great mood lighting which created a more relaxed atmosphere. The crew were friendly overall and the food was pretty good. The one thing that let Thomson down was the seat. For an aircraft that was 10 years in the planning it I think someone has messed up at Thomson with a basic design consideration. The seat itself is relatively comfortable and once sat down the leg room is adequate. This issue is that seat in the Premium cabin is clearly not designed to be so close to the seat in front. The TV screens are stowed in the central arm of the seat meaning that the arm rests between the seats protrudes out a significant distance to the seat in front. Even with the seats in the upright position the average sized person struggles to get out of the window seat without climbing over the aisle seat. During the flight you are regularly disturbed by the person behind grabbing your seat back in order for them to try and manoeuvre out of their window seat. You can already see signs of damage on the aisle seat armrest where the person in the window seat has put their weight on the armrest in order to get them self out. The seats recline no more than an inch or so and I assume they have been restricted as an afterthought in order to try and minimise the issue. This is annoying as it would be nice to recline your seat a little to get some rest (there will not be much dreaming going on in the Thomson Dreamliner). Once the seat in front reclines even this short distance you effectively become trapped in the window seat. The seats power sockets and headphone sockets are also located in the front of the central armrest holding the tv screens. It is almost impossible to access the sockets because you can't see the sockets or move your head into a position where you can. This is because your head hits the seat in front before you can get a viewing angle to see the sockets. Not looking forward to my long night flight home as I had hoped I would sleep. We paid £1300 each for return flights to Cancun and so I consider the value for money to be poor.

### Thomson Airways customer review
Do not fly with Thomson to Corfu. Thomson line all passengers up outside the airport in very long queues whilst all other airline passengers just wander through to check in! It means you fry out in the sun or at worse get soaked whilst you wait and wait! Then its a rush to get through security and its a choice between nipping to the loo or visiting the duty free shop as there is no time to do both! It just seems to be Thomson passengers who are forced to do this! Once on the plane the seat width is appalling and the planes are dirty. I went to look through a flight magazine but it was held together with chewing gum! All staff want to do is sell. Once landed you wait for ages to be released from the torture on this occasion the steps brought to the airport hit the plane! You just have to laugh!

Delayed for over 8 hours at Dalaman airport. Flight should have landed at Gatwick at 17.00 on the 2/9/13.arrived home at 02.00 am on the 3/9/2013. No Thomson staff at all in Dalaman airport. Announcements were inaudible. All we could do was look at the screens for any updates. After eventually boarding the plane 8 hours later. We were not even given a complimentary drink. No hot food was boarded on the plane for the passengers as this was due to Thomson not wanting no more delays. Once we were on the plane we were told the passengers flying from Gatwick to Dalaman had eaten the hot food.

We flew from London to Rhodes and return. We paid over £900 for the trip. It was awful. It is like flying on a shop. No service at all. Worse was yet to come. We were delayed nearly 4 hours on our return on Saturday night. No announcements were made. Vague apologies and a voucher. People with babies and small children were just left. Not a member of staff to be seen. It was appalling. They may have a new aircraft but their services and staff are dreadful. Never again. We will never fly with Thomson again. Absolutely dreadful and a complete rip off.

Returned from Lanzarote Friday morning flight delayed 4 hours first choice rep only seen at a distance at check in no explanation given for delay just handed inadequate 6 euro vouchers for food etc departure gate given as 2 then removed and replaced much later as 4. Still nobody to explain the delay queuing for the flight unhappy staff member said they were cleaning the plane got on the plane pilot explained that there was a problem with hydraulics and they had to send to Luton for part to fix it before flying out to us which suggested we were on the fixed plane however when a customer asked whether there would be hot food on the flight the attendant said no as it was on the other plane!

Just got back from Mexico Cancun travelled from Birmingham airport from 24/8/2013 to 31/8/2013 for 1 week. It was a 10 hour flight and I was appalled at level of service. Outbound to Mexico stewardess was not friendly when I asked for blanket told they had all been handed out. Air conditioning was either too hot or too cold all toilets were blocked near to arrival and closed off! Any cold soft drinks had to be purchased. Stewardesses always in a rush and not approachable. On the flight back the blankets were put on the seats prior to boarding air conditioning was terrible again no complimentary water for a 10 hour flight. This time I was given a beef meal which I don't eat for religious reasons. Seats very uncomfortable for a long haul 10 hour flight tables loose nearly falling off. Was not given any ear plugs told they were given out. They need to improve.

Trip from Gatwick to Sal Cape Verde. Due to take off at 1350 but sat on Gatwick airport Tarmac until 1600 whilst engineers tried to fix an unspecified 'minor fault' on our Boeing 757-200. This plane looks tatty and old clearly he safety warning system agrees. This review can only get worse. The pilot is waffling on about the unspecified problem.

Gatwick-Kefalonia-Gatwick a short flight but pleasant. Staff efficient and friendly offering the chance to purchase hot food right at the start and the chance of a drink before leaving us for a while to catch up on some sleep. Offered drinks a second time on this short flight along with duty free. Couldn't ask anymore really no pushy sales got what I expected and got off.. Return v similar only one drinks service but it felt about right. TV screens showing journey also used on both flights wish all Thomson's short haul flights had at least this.

Flight from Birmingham airport 25th July 2013 flight number TOM262 to Marrakech. Returned 8th August TOM 263. Informed on departure that a stewardess was off sick our co-operation was requested by the captain due to this. 1 hr 10 mins after take off drinks were served to us. The toilets then broke causing long queues. Stroppy sullen staff too busy talking to each other than to meet and greet passengers. Return flight as expected - as poor as anticipated. One cabin crew member spent the entire flight encouraging customers to buy duty free donate to their chosen charity. It was a night flight so a few moments peace would have been ideal. First and last time we will use Thomson.

Manchester to Mahon and return for a week's holiday. Outbound flight was on time and with no hitches to speak of. Return flight was a totally different experience. Arrived at the airport in good time and was expecting a 20.30 departure back to Manchester. Boarding time came and went departure time also and we could see the aircraft waiting for us in front of the boarding gate. We waited and waited until the aircraft Captain came into the lounge informing us of a technical problem which was not going to allow him to fly the plane home. They were hoping to get an engineer over from Palma but this did not happen. No flight home that night and after a 3 hour wait were out of the airport and to a hotel at nearly 02.00. Finally got off the ground at 12.30 the following day and eventually was nearly 16 hours late arriving in Manchester. The entire experience soured what had been an enjoyable holiday.

Palma to Edinburgh 11th June. Absolute nightmare 21 hour flight delay in total. We went through hell with Thomson pushing the flight back on several occasions and then eventually cancelling it at 2.30 am on the 12th. Thomson knew this flight was never going to take off on the 11th and still they would not come clean and cancel it at a decent time of day. We were bussed to hotels at 4.00 am back to the airport at 11.00 am and did not take off until 4.30pm on 12th. Thomson staff on the ground at Palma were non existent. If it had not been for the captain and cabin crew on our flight we might still be in Palma airport!

My review is pretty mixed as I had a terrible impression on the way out but a much better one coming home. Plane was brand new so lovely. We had the screens drop down to show us how far we had to fly where we were temperature etc. Cabin crew on the other hand were awful. Never met such a miserable bunch of people who clearly hate their jobs! Everything was too much trouble! Service was appalling. No smiles nothing! Flight was on time. I couldn't wait to get off the plane once we landed in Lanzarote! No hello no goodbye just grunts and huffs. Food was disgusting and dried up but coffee was nice. Coming home plane was a bit of an old banger our seats were ripped arm rests were falling apart and the drop down trays were too big so didn't come down properly if you were over a size 12. The crew however were lovely. All smiles hellos goodbyes and enjoying the banter we had with them. Food was still gross from what we could see from other passengers but coffee was still nice and the service was excellent. Food and drink is very over priced for what it is.

Having just flown to Menorca and return with my wife and 2 daughters we found the experience to be ok. I think even though its a short haul flight some sort of entertainment would have been good to occupy the children (cartoons or something for them). The food was bland I had a bacon baguette which was flat nearly tasteless and too expensive for what it was. Return the airline back to how it used to be a pleasure to fly not as it is now.

Port Santo Madeira to Gatwick on 6th August 2013. I have been using Thomsons for years and their hostess service continues to deteriorate each year. Flight was delayed an hour passengers are tired hungry and freezing cold. Thomsons crew respond to this by running out of hot food. Except for powdered soup and hot water for which they charge 3 pounds they also expect you to pay for blankets. This service is a disgrace if you want to call it that. Why don't you cut margins even more and dispense with cabin crew all together you could just have some one to do the safety announcements next year you'll probably start charging for oxygen masks too. Wake up Thomson this service is appalling and I for one won't be choosing Thomson next year.

Manchester to Dalaman Turkey and return June/July 2013. We booked extra leg room seats at a cost of £100. Seats good but unfortunately on both journeys had a 3 year old in seat behind who continually kicked our seat and kept putting tray table up and down. We asked parents to stop this but they did nothing except say "he's 3 years old". Really spoilt our journey. Stewardesses said they couldn't do anything. Won't be paying extra for leg room seats in future. Very poor customer care.

1st June 2013 from Ibiza to Gatwick with scheduled departure time of 11.50am. Departed at 20.30pm meaning a delay of over 8 hours (this after finding out that it wasn't just delayed it was cancelled). The flight wasn't just cancelled we were told once we had checked in that we would be flying with ‘Hi Fly’despite booking to fly with Thomson. The staff at Hi Fly made us all not confident on the trip. We were sitting on the plane for over an hour while the staff were running around looking unsure of what to do. This was our honeymoon and it was a bitter end to what was an amazing honeymoon.

TOM 4555 Mahon - Gatwick on 5th July 2013. Booked flights and extra legroom seats 11 months ago aircraft changed to a B787 Dreamliner. Expected to be given seats in the front section of the aircraft instead allocated seats in Row 30 despite plenty of seats available up front. Row 30 is a nightmare on this aircraft - the window seats have a pillar in front which restricts the angle the passenger can sit the space in front of the next two seats each side B C G H are used as a waiting area by people waiting to use the toilets and seats D E and F are immediately behind the toilets and used as a gangway between the two aisles by both passengers and flight attendants. Added to that the seats are narrow.

BHX-JSI return. Outward crew pleasant and friendly refreshingly so for Thomson return not so. Both ways plane was old and tatty looking and very uncomfortable despite us having "extra legroom" seats. How often do they get a clean? the tray table contained remnants of what appeared to be the previous passengers baby food and there was rubbish in the seat pocket. On the return flight the seem to have employed a crew member to do nothing but continually screech over the PA system virtually reading through the entire reading collateral of the seat pocket in a desperate attempt to make you buy duty free scent food drinks scratch cards charity donations details of websites questionnaires rinse and repeat. Some of us may have liked a nap impossible. I could understand if they pitched themselves as a "cheap and cheerful" airline but they seemed to have removed every last frill and upped their prices while constantly trying to pretend they care about their passengers. For what we paid for a return 3 hour flight on Thomson we flew return to Bali with a full service airline in comfort with food drinks and great crew. We are booking the Caribbean for later in the year and will now make the trek to Gatwick in order to avoid using Thomson.

27 June Gatwick to Antalya. On Dreamliner. Not informed of this at check in although we had pre-booked seats in rows 6&7 changed to rows 3&4 with no explanation. Not overly impressed by this new superliner. The seats in premium were a huge disappointment. The recliner is not as much as older models and the reclining leg rest is not sufficient. 4 July flew back again on dreamliner. Our seat bookings had been changed and this time to rows 17&18. No real apologies by staff at Antalya or Thomson. Although seats recline back further and good leg room still has that 'squashed' feeling. Crew on both flights were not the usual happy charming staff and in fact the outbound flight in premium were very rude and not interested at being on this plane at all! A great disappointment all around and not the usual Thomson delight.

### Thomson Airways customer review
Flew Manchester to Ibiza return. Outbound was acceptable with at least a map to know where the plane is. On the return the seats were appalling. The magazines and safety booklets were in a slot behind the person in front's headrest and therefore nowhere to put a plastic bottle or wedge a book in. The cabin staff were nothing but rude and unhelpful when we asked why this facility had been taken away suggesting that they were offering more leg room! I certainly will never do short haul with this airline again and only premium economy in long haul!

We were meant to be flying the dreamliner from EMA on 12/06/13 to Mexico but because of the delays were we on a First Choice 767 - we upgraded to premium and don't regret it! Very smooth and quick check in fast tracked through security and through to departures. We were called first onto the plane seated handed drinks and newspapers before takeoff. Plenty of drinks all you had to do was ask and food was nice - for aeroplane standards. Seats were comfortable and aircraft was clean. Landed 30 minutes early into Cancun. On the way home we were checked in quickly due to priority boarding - very stress free! Booked to use the business lounge while we waited. Boarded onto the plane first blankets night packs and newspapers were on our seats and drinks were handed out. Again staff were very friendly attentive and chatty! Food came out and drinks - once service had stopped if you needed a drink all you had to do was press your call button. Breakfast served 1.30 hours before landing back to EMA. I would recommend travelling premium when going long haul it was worth it. The IFE was good there and back lots of films and TV to keep you entertained. I would recommend flying with Thomson.

Flew to Orlando (Sanford) from Bristol in May. Had pre-booked using the select your seat. Waited over 90mins in cramped check-in at Bristol while 2 people checked people in. Had no time to get breakfast and had to dash though Duty free even though arrived more than 2 hours before departure. No-one mentioned that the plane was a stand-in and not a long haul one! Asked to move as the back seat was empty - and staff let us. Coming back we asked what seats we had and were 2 rows from back - asked to move to back and said yes - but on both flights I only got the seats I wanted because we asked to move - when complained (nicely) to Thomson back home was told I was paying to sit with partner and I should have read the small print on website. Am flying with them again but will take my chances as the select your seat is just a rip-off!

Booked premium seating and chose rows 4 and 5 as these were best seats available on the seating plan I rang customer services to explain that my daughter was disabled and would prefer seats on the side of the plane that the toilet was situated if possible just for the ease of it. They explained that this was not possible as all the other seats were taken. I accepted this however on the day we were given seats next to the toilet which was perfect. The staff on this flight from Newcastle 17th June 2013 10.35am flight were very good friendly helpful and attentive best cabin crew I've had. The food was reasonable drinks were plenty. The only bad point I had but it didn't bother me a lot was mould on the cheese sandwich given towards end of flight. Flight left on time.

The major problem was the check-in system. There were hundreds of people queuing for several flights when we arrived at Manchester airport at 6.20am for our 7.55am flight to Innsbruck Not early enough obviously. There was no system for prioritising flights and we were called by tannoy from the queue eventually as we were going to miss the flight. We were not the only ones and were not the last to board. We ran through duty free carrying belts keys etc. There was no system for calling early flights to the front of the queue or for allotting specific desks to particular flights. I have anecdotal evidence that this situation arises every Saturday.

Thomson Flights say they offer 'Great customer service'. Not in my experience. Upon arriving at the check in desk at Stansted I got no words of welcome no pleasantries at all. A cold reception and unhelpful and unfriendly staff. I was left alone at the departure gate still awaiting the pre booked special assistance. I never got to venture inside the lounge I had paid for it was an awful experience for my very first visit to Stansted Airport. To top it all I was forced to pay almost £120 in excess luggage fees. I was told both check in staff 'I could throw away what I don't need there are bins dotted all around the airport'.

Flew to Jamaica from Birmingham in Premium Cabin on a 767-300er. What a fantastic flight! Service was top notch lots of drinks rounds by the staff food good and comfortable seating. Overall very happy. However the return journey was delayed from 17.20 to 22.00 no premium cabin so crammed into smaller seats. Luckily we had the bulkhead row so had slightly better legroom. Thomson handled the delay well. We still received the free drinks amenity packs upgraded food etc. Just not the bigger seats. In spite of still receiving most of the perks we have received a refund of the premium fare.

Manchester to Cancun 3rd May and Cancun to Manchester 18th May. The plane was dirty the inflight entertainment was poor with a choice of about 3 films and told when to watch them! The clips to the food tray were broken with rips in the seats the cameras to watch landing and take off was broken too. Staff were good! The food was okay when we arrived at Manchester Thomson had one queue for about 5 flights so needless to say we queued for 3 hours and had 10 mins in the duty free before we took off. Will be going back but I will try my best to not fly with Thomson. There was meant to be 2 meals for an 10 hour flight but we only received one? Entertainment poor staff good the plane itself was tatty and aged.

First flight with Thompson Airways and delayed almost 5 hours with no communication or compensation and had a 3 year old to contend with. Incurred costs for meals drinks and a taxi fare not previously budgeted for. Airport side terrible onboard better but only advised about vouchers once on board and due to late take off limited food options and long wait too. Overall experience outbound awful. Inbound better though food options restricted due to bad planning.

Arrived at check in 3 hours prior to our flight. After Thompson closed the check in desk as it became uncertain that flight TOM517 would be flying. Told to sit and await news 2.5 hours passed with no news or information. Some 30 mins before a Manchester flight was to depart it was announced there were so many spare seats that all passengers on TOM 517 would be getting on. After being left no alternative we checked in and rushed onboard. This flight was in fact delayed. Moments before check in we were informed our checked bags would be delivered to our house around 48 hours after we returned home. During the flight the pilot announced there was nothing in place to make our transfer to Birmingham smooth. Had we of wished to fly from and to Manchester we would have booked cheaper tickets and driven ourselves to this airport. After we were taxied to Birmingham international via coach arriving at 4.45am we were met by a Birmingham Airport representative that told some of the group their baggage had arrived. I am a very frequent flyer and have never experience such bad service followed by disorganised unclear poorly managed resolution.

### Thomson Airways customer review
Due to come back from Paphos on 12th June. French air traffic control wreaked havoc with the schedule. These things happen but it was the way that Thomson chose to deal with it that disappointed most. I accept the delay as inevitable but Thomson chose to send the taxi to our 5 star hotel a full 7 hours before the flight was likely to depart at best. We were at the airport before the plane had even left the UK to come to Cyprus forcing us to spend 7 hours in Pahos airport. The airport manager couldn't adequately explain how it benefited anyone other than Thomson for us to spend so long at the airport. The completion of a complaint form with him was a farce as I received an immediate auto response saying that the local staff were empowered to deal with any issues. All anyone did was pass it up the line. When the plane did arrive we were told that we would go to Gatwick rather than Manchester. We left at 2am. The plane was freezing cold in our section. The crew were tired. We did eventually land at Manchester  for which we are grateful but I suspect the whole thing was stage managed. Very disappointed. I won't fly with this shower again if I have a choice.

London Gatwick - Puerto Plata - return - Premium Cabin. Our return flights exceeded our expectations and we were really pleased. The plane - an elderly First Choice 767 - was in fairly good nick inside and the premium seats were comfortable and offered decent legroom. Inflight entertainment was a little clunky but worked fine. The food was really good and the service from the crews in both directions was friendly and efficient. No problems getting drinks when required. The only negative was the 45 minute queue for the day before check-in as only one agent was on. 2 more were found just as we got to the counter.

Cardiff to Dalaman on 20/5/2013 and return on 30/5/2013. We often travel from Cardiff with Thomson and always have great service. On the outward flight the aircraft was clean and tidy and took off early Excellent announcements from the cockpit crew and even told us sights we were overflying Cabin Crew were very helpful and attentive. Its a shame that Thomson have removed the inflight entertainment but didn't seem to bother anyone Food was great but perhaps a bit expensive. Return flight was also excellent departed 25mins early from Dalaman and arrived in Cardiff 1hr early A bit bumpy on the way back but again excellent announcements from the cockpit. All in all a great experience and as always is from Cardiff with Thomson.

Edinburgh to Palma (18/05/13) on the Sunwings aircraft that Thomson are using out of Edinburgh this year. The plane was comfortable better than the usual Thomson offerings supplied by Monarch that we've had previously. Cabin crew going out weren't too bad but coming back they seem to be more human and interacted with passengers. After a delayed take off from Edinburgh (1 hour delay) they announced that orders would be taken for any hot foods bacon baguettes seemed to be the order of the day only for staff to then come round telling most folk that they'd run out due to not getting the full quota of baguettes. Due to the plane being Canadian all the safety announcements were made in English and French which was different. On the return flight there were no announcements from the flight deck other which I thought was somewhat unusual and the seatbelt signs seemed to be activated after the turbulence not before!

Flew to Lanzarote in April from Newcastle. Had pre booked and chosen our seats when we boarded the plane asked why we didn't have seats we chose told different plane but we were seated together. Very rude staff no people skills at all. Plane was cramped no leg room seat in front was pressing on my knees - felt so claustrophobic. When getting off plane same member of staff very sarcastically said you might get right seats going back as it wont be same plane. Coming back didn't get right seats again better plane more room.

After reading reviews was terrified that I was flying with Thomson but flight from Luton to Las Palmas was great smooth check in cabin staff polite and attentive. Sat together 3 of us there and back at no extra cost. Only had drinks on outward flight but enjoyed hot snacks on way back no complaints at all and will fly with them again.

London Gatwick to Aruba May 2013. First flight with Thomson never again! I object to having to pay in order to sit with your family that should be given. 2 hour delay on the way out no proper communication. Ground staff said it was due to cleaning and maintenance requirements after previous flight delays. Captain then said it was due to an incident at Heathrow meaning too many flights having to go out of Gatwick. Plane was shabby and old working a 2-3-2 configuration. Staff seemed miserable and de-motivated plane full which meant constant queue for toilets. Space issues meant that queuing got in the way of cabin crew constantly selling. One of our tables had a broken arm. Food was fine and so was in-flight entertainment. On the return journey there was another 2 hour delay with no explanation given. Had the same seats and the table still had a broken arm! This was a night flight and none of the lights for the middle aisles were working so couldn't read a book or even see to fill in their questionnaire the whole journey! Cabin crew tried to fix them but couldn't. Again - miserable female staff males were a bit more cheerful. Will never fly with Thomson again BA Virgin and Thomas Cook are infinitely better.

Manchester to Boa Vista April 2013. I booked every extra as a special treat for my girlfriend and Thomson failed on every one. Airport lounge was appalling and we left early. Fast Track security was open to all another lot of money wasted. The bubbly and chocks booked the cabin crew had no knowledge of and refused to give me the chocolates. Only 2 drinks services on a 7 hour flight. Having booked legroom seats at £85 pp for the return the airline denied all knowledge the day before return. On check in we were 6 rows apart having previously selected adjoining seats. The bar had sold out on the outbound flight. Lazy cabin crew disinterested reps old tired aircraft poor selection of airport partners (lounges) and no quality control. Unfortunately they were the only option to my chosen destination. Next time I will chose more wisely.

Manchester to Sanford Florida at the beginning of May it was the first time we have travelled with Thomson and will be the last. The plane was dirty and the seats were tatty and uncomfortable the films would not play and the staff were very rude. Food was terrible and was skimmed across to us with such force I didn't know if I would be eating it or wearing it.

### Thomson Airways customer review
We flew from Glasgow to Cancun and back. The seats were worn filthy and torn. I had to keep all of my things on the floor the whole flight which was uncomfortable on a 10.5 hour flight. My husband and I don't drink alcohol we kindly asked them to sell us diet coke or water with the dinner but staff said "No sorry. Only red or white wine. It's unacceptable to eat only chocolate or sweets for 10.5 hours. The food they served was microwaved pasta which makes you feel full for 30 minutes. On a 10.5 hour flight we could only buy something to drink 2 times. The plane was extremely warm and passengers was sweaty and thirsty. Service from staff was non existent.

Flight Tom1454 ex Edinburgh to Lanzarote 02/05/13. Booked in at 04.45 for a 07.10 departure-advised 3 hour delay. Departure board at 09.00 advised flight now cancelled. At least 15 minutes to be advised by tanoy - "collect luggage from baggage hall2. 30/40 minutes later we were being bussed to Glasgow for a 14.30 departure - no sign of any Thomson Staff. At Glasgow 1 hr 15 mins to be rebooked in again at check in. After going through security check in for a second time went for a bite to eat with our "£8 food vouchers". Went to the departure gate to find that the flight was now departing at 15.30. Gate staff gave the impression that they were being put out. Boarded the plane to find that our seats were not the extra leg room seats that we had paid for at time of booking but just normal row seating. Cabin manager did not want to know when approached for an answer/solution her overall attitude left a great deal to be desired. Pilot announced to passengers "please do not take out all our frustrations out on the cabin crew". Arrive 8.5 hours late in Lanzarote. I find it unbelievable that passengers/customers that can and are treated in this way especially not from a major airline like Thomson.

### Thomson Airways customer review
14 March 2013 Manchester - Tenerife South Flight TOM2458. Return 21 March 2013 Flight TOM2459. I will keep it short. No entertainment. No proper food - microwaved. Staff more interested in duty free selling than looking after customers comfort. Plastic bags full of sandwiches kept in overhead lockers. Seats torn and sagging pull down tables broken. Will be a long time before I use them again. I did send a letter of complaint which has taken 8 weeks to be acknowledged.

### Thomson Airways customer review
We travelled to Zante on a 737 800 in all the years we have flown it was the worst plane! It was too small the cabin much smaller. The seats were uncomfortable and worn and if you are tall then there is no chance! No entertainment on board. Hated the whole experience cant believe they use them on 3.5 hrs journey. As for the toilets keep well away no room at all.

### Thomson Airways customer review
Flew to Egypt in February. From the day before departure up until reaching the airport on the morning of our flight we were trying to book extra baggage allowance. We were given 15kg for an 11 night holiday. At check in desk we were 10kg over between 4 people that cost us ££110. Said that we tried to book more baggage told the website closes 3 days before travel. Not told this at time of booking it is not on there website neither is it in their terms and conditions apparently it does not have to be. Told to buy extra luggage allowance to save paying on return journey which we did. You do not have to do that as no one checks your weight at Sharm El Sheik airport they are not interested how much your suitcase weighs. We will be very careful when using Thomson again as they are one of the dearest package holiday companies but give you the least of everything.

### Thomson Airways customer review
Flew out on the 13th May and to be honest was dreading the flight because of all the bad reviews but was pleasantly surprised. Lots of legroom not cramped prompt service for food and drink which was good and the cabin crew were fine. Return journey however the cabin crew were too busy talking to each other to bother about whether or not we had been served food and drink we had to ask for hot food which we got but were then not charged for because he forgot about us all a bit hit and miss. Plane was ok though again lots of legroom cabin crew needed to be more attentive we had an hour and half delay out of Gatwick which was a pain but coming back from Gran Canaria on 20th May there were no delays. No entertainment which is not good people have taken note of this and took their own entertainment on board and a lot of people also took their own food.

### Thomson Airways customer review
I was dreading the Thomson flight from Gatwick to Sharm last week. The last time I flew on this route was on an old 757 with very cramped seats and no elbow room. My flight booking indicated that we would be on the same type of aircraft. What a surprise on boarding! A brand new 737-800 clean and fresh with almost decent legroom. The price is such that this is what should be supplied on this route it is no longer a cheap option to fly Thomson. There is no entertainment at all on a 5.5 hour flight not even recorded music. Thank god for i-pods. The bacon baguette was decent and the drinks not too expensive. The only niggle is that I often fly on full service carriers to Thailand (Twice the distance) with everything free and great in flight entertainment for only £100 more. Not only are the fares now much higher you are charged for baggage seat allocation food drink etc.

### Thomson Airways customer review
Leeds Bradford to Sharm El Sheik was satisfactory although many passengers were unhappy with the lack of any entertainment. We had booked the extra leg room seats and these were fine with lots of leg room however there appeared to be little food to eat and that which was available was rather expensive. However on the flight back the plane took off late (no explanation nor apology). The crew were the slowest I have seen (it took almost an hour to serve drinks and food to row 5). As the crew started at the front and rear of the plane it became clear that there was not sufficient food on board (there had been no hot food and only 'a couple of sandwiches' - which had sold before row 5! Since the extra leg room seats are in row 16 which is the middle of the plane there was no food left even for the children (as adults in desperation had ordered these!). Again the duty free followed the same route therefore after trying to purchase 5 different items in a row (out of stock did not have any) one could only feel rather put out that we had paid extra for a minimal amount of extra leg room on the return journey and for this extra fee we got the worst service possible. Even when raising this with the crew the reply was that they were 'fed up of giving Thompson feedback as it is ignored!'. So in warning no entertainment no food no duty free. Very basic service.

We fly with Thomsom/First Choice a few times each year to Mombasa in Kenya for us it is good and comfortable. We have just returned from Mombasa on 5th May 2013 the food was smashing the staff very helpful and polite - what more can you ask. Being disabled I know they will look after me and my wife.

### Thomson Airways customer review
Manchester to Larnaca return. The 757 was showing its age and the cabin crew seemed a little more interested in gossiping among themselves than offering a prompt service. However we arrived on time on both flights and actually departed early on the way home. The croque monsieur bacon baguette and chips were all pretty good. We knew before booking that there would be no IFE tight legroom and no traditional meals and in fairness to Thomson they met our expectations. Far from a bad experience.

### Thomson Airways customer review
Flew from Manchester to Sanford Florida on an old workhorse (as described by the pilot) Boeing 767 in economy this aircraft was used because of the Dreamliner issues. Seating configuration was 2-3-2. Seat width was not good but legroom was decent. My biggest complaint has to be the staff who just were not interested in the passengers I was knocked a couple of times by passing crew with not a word of apology from them.

### Thomson Airways customer review
Regardless of anything else the fact that this company charge me £1500 for a week away and then want me to pay to sit next to my partner is simply not acceptable. I can see why one might be asked to pay for seat selection in the prime spots but to have 2 seats together no that is wrong. This is the last holiday I book with Thomson. If I wanted to be treated like this I would have used Ryanair.

### Thomson Airways customer review
Flew premium cabin to Punta Cana April 2013. Return flight was terrible. The seats were old and the cushioning was worn. As we were served last we had no choice of menu and had to make do with the food that nobody else wanted. The cabin crew were short and rude to some passengers and they appeared to be improperly trained to deal with passenger demands and were unable to remain professional when dealing with passengers. A training need maybe? Thomson seem to have gone 'downhill' lately. What has happened to them? Lack of competition perhaps?

### Thomson Airways customer review
Departure from Cardiff Airport - surly and unhelpful check in staff. Although my carry on luggage was the correct dimension it weighed more than the sparse 5kg - my fault for not checking this. However other airlines allow 10kg carry on. I had to pay £44 to put bag in hold. During my holiday I tried to use the 'manage my booking' online option to pre pay for my return luggage and not incur further penalty charges. However this proved impossible. Thomson's login screen doesn't allow a departure date to be inserted once you have left the UK - so you can't get beyond the login screen. Their systems seem to be engineered to extort as much money as possible out of passengers. This is the first time I have flown with Thomson and will not do so again.

### Thomson Airways customer review
Manchester to Cancun we were ready for take-off when a fault was discovered. We taxied back to the terminal then left on the aircraft without water or food for 3.25 hours whilst the engineers tried to fix the problem. We were then disembarked and bussed back to the terminal without Thomson representation or any advice or guidance on next steps. Eventually we were asked to collect our baggage and stayed at the airport hotel until the following day. We flew out eventually 23.5 hours late. The service throughout was non-existent with a catalogue of promised updates that didn't come alongside receiving no updates or advice when it should have been due or apology. To add insult to injury once we did get under way food and gift options had been forgotten.

Premium economy Manchester to Dominican Republic return. On both flights we found cabin staff very friendly and helpful. Inflight entertainment provided was excellent. Comfort was good seats comfy and plenty of legroom. The pamper packs provided proved to be most useful. Inflight meals of the highest standard and drinks service regular. All in all a very enjoyable experience and can't wait to fly Thomson premium again!

Just travelled to Tenerife and back flight only with Thomson. Flight out from Manchester 20th April at 13.55pm. Off on time new plane great staff comfortable seats and arrived early. Did not purchase any food. Back on 27th April 19.25pm from TFS arrived early in Manchester again a great flight friendly staff and new aircraft. Such a contrast from our last flight with Monarch. Will definitely fly Thomson again.

### Thomson Airways customer review
Just travelled to Marrakech with Thomson Airways. We have now travelled with Thomson 3 times since they changed from an inflight meal service to purchasing snacks. On the way back from Marrakech which was a 3 hour 10 minute flight at tea time. We were sat on row 20 which is about 2/3's the way back of the plane. The snack service took over 2 hours to get to us. The cabin crew were like headless chickens up and down the aisle collecting hot food from the rear of the plane and passing it between the rear and front trolley. Go back to a full meal service and stick another few quid on each ticket. It is much simpler and surely easier on the poor cabin crew.

### Thomson Airways customer review
Booked extra leg room seats for our flight however prior to going on holiday my wife had to have a shoulder op therefore did not meet the min requirements for those seats so we upgraded to Premium Economy at the extra cost. One week prior to travel we were told that due to technical reasons our return aircraft had changed and that we would not be traveling back P/E (what technical issues did they foresee 3 weeks down the road). This happened to a number of people on our flight and other flights after that apparently not an uncommon occurrence for Thomson to do this. Appalling customer service with hardly an apology.

### Thomson Airways customer review
Stansted to Rhodes and back. The flight was comfortable and nice clean leather seats although not a flexible pitch. The legroom was enough for me. There was no option for tv but it just for 3hr 50 mins flight. The inflight meal was on payment and they served nice hot meal. The water bottles are really expensive.

Bristol - Tenerife - Bristol travelled in April on Boeing 757-200. Noticed that we had more legroom than previously and was informed on return journey that they have removed some seats in response to passenger comments and its not much more roomy. Plenty for a four hour flight but shame about the entertainment being switched off still. Food and drink reasonable and service excellent.

### Thomson Airways customer review
I am a frequent traveller and in the most recent years I have suffered severely with arthritic knees and hence require an extra leg room seat. I have found that this given the appropriate booking time allowance has never been a problem on other airlines. Thomson however have as other airlines always told me to book only seven days in advance but never deliver only to tell you on the day that all leg room seats are booked. I am currently at the RIU Karaamboa I Boa Vista Cape Verde and returning home on the 30th April to Gatwick. The usual story I'm afraid after requesting my leg room seat on arrival I was told to request 7 days before departure (today) when I'm told that there was none available.

### Thomson Airways customer review
We were flying from Bristol to Orlando on a B767-300. The flight all went smoothly. However on arriving at Orlando airport we found out the aircraft had pressurisation problems back at Bristol. So we had a long 8-9 hour wait (longer than our flight) whilst they flew in a very old and uncomfortable B757-200. It was a very bad flight.

### Thomson Airways customer review
I cannot find the words that express how bad this flight is. Just returned from Tunisia - but having left the hotel before breakfast and then find on the flight they did not have enough food and I am diabetic. All they said y is 'we have sold out of that' - Food Drinks and Duty Free. Previously on a trip to Egypt they forgot to load the food on board.

### Thomson Airways customer review
Manchester to Punta Cana December 2012 in Economy and had plenty of leg room. I'm only 5'6" so not very tall but could stretch my legs out fully in front of me no problem. Plane was 2-3-2 rather than 2-4-2 which we had the previous time. Staff were good friendly and always at hand. Paid the extra £5 for the extra TV options which I think is worth it just for the on demand option. Food was good though the pillows on the night flight home are pretty useless better to take your own neck pillow. All in all I would definitely recommend Thomson/First Choice and will be flying with them long-haul in the future.

### Thomson Airways customer review
Manchester to Cancun. Booked extra legroom seats in economy no problem with legroom. The problem was my seat was faulty and would not stay in the upright position. Every time I tried to relax as you would on an almost 11 hour flight the poor guy behind me would have the back of my seat almost in his face. The stewardess did try to fix it to no avail. Basically we endured a hellish flight as we had to sit bolt upright. The food was so so nothing to rave about. The other big issue was that about 5 hours into the flight 3 of the 5 toilets were blocked and out of order. Drinks were not served after the announcement regarding blocked toilets. Thankfully I had brought water on board but really felt it for those who hadn't. I would never fly more than a couple of hours again with Thomsons.

### Thomson Airways customer review
Manchester - Malaga - Manchester 08/03/2013 to 19/03/2013. Both aircraft's were fairly new 737 which have the new Dreamliner style interior. The blue leather seats were comfortable enough for a short flight especially considering I am 6ft 1 tall! I did notice that the aircraft could have done with a deep clean. Service on board was professional and friendly. The onboard menu was quite expensive - especially £2.50 for a tiny portion of chips. I highly recommend the cheese and tomato Panini which although does not look nice tasted delicious. The only IFE is the map this may be an issue if on a longer flight. This is the first time flying with Thomson Airways as I usually fly with Monarch and overall I was satisfied and will use them again if the price is right.

### Thomson Airways customer review
Leeds Bradford to Sharm El Sheik. Never been particularly bothered about the quality of 'package airlines' such as this but on this occasion I felt the aircraft was of a poor standard considering the length of flight (5.5 hours). Too often on Thomson flights there is a complete lack of hot food options (despite the fact that prices are over inflated and they need you to buy things). The seat quality and leg room for a medium haul flight wasn't acceptable. Of course a pillow and blanket can be bought - but I doubt this would compensate. No inflight entertainment i.e. TV radio papers magazines. The only thing of interest was to observe how much people bought from the endless trolley services or over priced food drinks souvenirs and duty free. Thomson seem to be severely lacking in the art of distraction.

### Thomson Airways customer review
Manchester to Sharm-El-Sheikh return. Without any doubt the worst flight we have been on. Never been so uncomfortable horrible leather seats no overhead air vents. Then they have the cheek to charge £1.40 for a tea bag and some hot water and £7.50 plus £2.50 for head phones if you want to watch a television. Come on Thomson I didn't expect Emirates standards but you really need to up your game!

### Thomson Airways customer review
Flight out delayed an hour. We were flying to Cancun we had about 2.5 hours to go when they said there was only 1 toilet working people were queuing 45 mins to use it. The inflight service stopped which is very annoying when you have upgraded. The seats were very uncomfortable there was a crying child in front and when the seat in front was reclined they were almost in your lap. Food was mediocre.

### Thomson Airways customer review
I flew twice with Thomson last year BRS-EFL (Kefalonia) in May 2012 and BRS-FUE (F'ventura) in Sep 2012. Both flights had attentive staff and as I am blind they went through the safety brief not all airlines do. The seats were very hard with tight leg room B757s on both routes. I felt the new onboard catering was good had a baguette which was tasty. I cannot say they are a good airline but adequate and I will use them in the future.

### Thomson Airways customer review
Manchester - Puerto Plata - Manchester. Travelled in the Premium Cabin for the first time row 2 on right- hand side of plane (opp side to the loo). Very impressed - all aspects comparable to a Virgin Premium Economy seat (apart from Virgin seats are wider) for half the price. Good and plentiful food individually served. Good entertainment. Snacks/water/drinks/ice cream all kept on coming. Complimentary papers and magazines and useful pamper pack. Coupled with the priority check-in and fast track security I was really impressed - especially after an awful trip to Sharm in the regular cabin the year before. Very pleasantly surprised.

### Thomson Airways customer review
Luton - Sharm el Sheikh - Luton. Just returned from a Cruise and Stay package - a wonderful holiday only marred by the flights. It would seem now that Thomson Airways do all they can to make this part of the holiday as uncomfortable and unpleasant as possible. Staff are miserable food is awful and seating cramped. You can only concentrate on the disadvantages even more because there is no in-flight entertainment to take your mind of the inadequacies over a 5 plus hour flight. When my husband ordered food on our evening flight home we were told by a grumpy crew member that 'you can only have what wasn't wanted from the outward bound flight so not everything is available - after all you really can't expect us to cater for 400 people! If Thomson Airways continue in this way then we just have to look elsewhere to get to our holiday destination.

### Thomson Airways customer review
Flew to and from Maldives. Outbound flight was okay but return flight was terrible. The cabin crew in premium were downright rude. My husband had been watching one of the onboard films and it reset itself after half an hour he asked the steward what had happened and the steward said 'I didn't even know the films had started yet but don't worry you have another 11.5 hours to watch it'. I was sat in the middle seat of the centre row I was served my tray of food from the right hand crew but they bypassed me with the actual meal wine and roll so when my husband was being served from the left hand crew he asked her for a meal wine and roll for me first she said I will be served from the other side who had already finished serving by the way and when I pointed this out she huffed and almost threw my meal at me. Later into the flight my husband needed some water and as he didn't want to wake the people around him by calling the cabin crew he went to their kitchen area and asked for a bottle only to be greeted with great huffs and the crew looking amongst themselves to see who would serve everything just seems to much trouble for them. We paid a lot extra to sit in the premium cabin but be warned the extra wide seats do not apply to the centre seat in the middle row this seat is the same size as the seats in economy. Thomson really need to look at all the seats on their flights they are so old the cushion has collapsed on them and it is like sitting on a block of wood. I will never fly long haul with Thomson again the crew on this last flight has put both myself and my husband off using this company.

LGW-LXR-LGW. Having read reviews on this airline I felt dread; mainly because of the seat pitch my height and a knee problem but I discovered that although it was a bit tight it was comfortable enough. Both flights were at least 98% full and when the cabin service was in full swing the queue for the toilets meant chaos ensued. The aircraft was very modern and clean though and cabin crew were pleasant enough although a smile from some of them wouldn't go amiss sometimes. Safety video made my partner and I smile though!

Birmingham to Las Palmas on 11 February and back the week later. 757-200 both ways. Pretty cramped on the outbound flight but loads of room on the inbound - there seemed to be some row numbers missing. I thought the cabin crew were excellent both ways and the Captain's handling of the sudden go slow at LPA on the return was managed with great aplomb. Yes I wish they'd bring back a proper meal and entertainment but we coped for 3hrs and 45mins.

Bristol - Tenerife South 25th Dec. After an early start travelling from Cardiff arrived at check in at 6.45 check in very slow. After finally boarding our 757 (BH-Dreamliner Livery) we arrived at our seats 35 ABC. The last time I flew on a Thomson 757 I remember it being generally quite spacious but was shocked when I arrived to our seats. Was very uncomfortable and unsettled before pushback. All IFE has been removed which is really quite shocking due to many youngsters on board flights not so much a problem for the adults. All meals been removed due to being short haul which is again quite shocking. On the way back exact same aircraft (BH) but this time was seated in 19 DEF these seats seemed much more spacious for some reason probably was exactly the same.

We received headphones eye mask socks etc were all very useful. We travelled Premium class.

### Thomson Airways customer review
We travelled to Cancun on 3rd January 2013. Flight took a couple of hours longer due to headwind which made an uncomfortable flight even more unpleasant. The seat I had pre-booked at extra cost would not fully recline so sleeping for part of the journey to recover from an early start was impossible. The inflight entertainment is limited you are encouraged to pay an extra £10 to be able to watch films at a time convenient to you. The inflight food is meagre. If you want water it is to be paid for. On long haul flights surely this should be free. Inflight staff spend most of their time selling food and drink and other payable options. After spending 8 hours on this flight we were then told that we would have to complete customs immigrations forms for Mexican customs but they didn't have any on board. Later we were told that someone would bring them out to the plane when we landed and given to us on debarkation. However they had run out/ We were then told we could get them in the customs hall. Arrived in the customs area to overcrowded chaos. They managed to locate some forms for us and we then had to try to complete them whilst we were walking in the queue. Another passenger in the queue told us they had the same trouble last year! I always considered Thomson to be a good company to book with. Not anymore.

Flew Gatwick to Boa Vista Cape Verde departing Feb 4th - (6.5 hrs). Plane full and old. Very cramped seats. Staff spend all their time trying to sell you stuff rather than looking after you. Thomson categorise this as short haul and there is no entertainment on board. This is a company who send people on all inclusive luxury breaks and expect their resorts to look after them when they have no intention of doing so themselves.

Flew Manchester to Tenerife return. How Thomson flights have gone down. Really old plane with very cramped seats and no leg room really uncomfortable for a 4.5 hour flight. Did not realise the film and music had been removed. When asked the air stewardess said it had been removed as most people had IPads. How wrong no one had one and everyone was moaning about the lack of entertainment. Drink prices high. Could not believe how the standard of the plane and the service you received had gone down since I last flew Thomson. Would look for another airline to fly with next time.

Manchester - Cancun January 15th 2013. Flight approx 40 minutes late departing as had to de-frost wings. Newspapers available for everyone comfortable flight leg room adequate. Flight crew were attentive and informative. Meal quite nice including snack before landing. Ran out of red wine fairly quickly so many passengers would have been disappointed. Upgraded inflight entertainment and watched a couple of films to pass the time. Journey back on the 29th was a night flight similar to the day flight but the snack before landing was not as fresh. Pillow and blankets supplied.

La Palma to Manchester. Vast improvement since the new 738's have replaced the old ex Air 2000 A320's. Well worth paying for the exit seats on this 4 hour trip. Seats quite supportive and like the Dreamliner style interior and lighting. Food and drink quite tasty and not badly priced. Not sure if I'd fancy this product on a 9h+ slog to Orlando Mexico or the Far East but for the Canaries or less it's pretty good value.

Outward flight from LGW to FUE on a nearly new Boeing 737-800 in extra legroom seats (row 15). Seat pitch and width good crew efficient and worked hard. Prompt departure and regular announcements from the captain. Shame about the shambles at check in - whether or not you have to pay extra for being 0.2kg over the luggage limit largely depends on who checks you in. The rude staff member we encountered took pleasure in making us open and re-arrange our bags on the terminal floor. Not the best start to a holiday especially when people with much larger and heavier bags than us. Food okay but nothing special also £2.50 for a small bag of chips is excessive. Return was on a Boeing 757-200 again in extra legroom seats (row 32). No problem at check in this time. Again good legroom and seat width and a prompt departure. The only problem with these seats is that they are by the toilets and therefore the aisle area can get busy. The crew again worked hard but two particular female attendants were rude and snappy.

Flew from Birmingham to Lanzarote on 10/01/13. Plane was one of the oldest in the fleet - a 757. We had plenty of leg room flight was very good cabin crew were good. Only downside was on a 4 hour flight there was no entertainment onboard. We had the same plane on the return.

Travelled back from Cuba to Gatwick on a 9 hour night flight with the toilet to my left within 2 hours of the flight I could no longer take the smell. I complained to the cabin manager who was abrupt very unhelpful and told me I would have to put up with it. My young daughter was sat next to the toilet on the other side and moaned about the smell all night. Never again with Thomson.

Birmingham-Salzburg December 2012. For what is only a 2-hour flight you'd pretty much expect to get by with anything. Wrong. Despite moving our flight time forward by 4 hours so it was a 4am check-in we arrived at 3.50. After the usual ski-queue wait we checked our bags only to be told that only 2 ski bags (instead of the 4 we booked) were on their system. We showed them the tickets and the invoice which clearly stated 4 ski carriage paid for but they said they could not take the other 2. The supervisor was called and clearly knew no better - checked the system and confirmed only 2 bags were showing. Basically we either pay £90 for the other bags to be put on the flight or leave them! No help to get through security and arrived at the gate to be told the gate was closed. After reasoning with the gate staff they got a bus and got us to the plane. The whole lack of awareness appreciation or any semblance of customer service means unless there is no other option we'll look elsewhere for future flights.

GLA-LPA-GLA. Outbound 15 Dec and inbound 22 Dec. Outbound B757-200 aircraft appeared to be ex-First Choice. Flight operated to schedule and having paid for 'Extra Leg room seats' the journey was fairly comfortable. I was seated in row 12 a middle seat next to a main door. The Cabin Crew fitted a draft excluder to the door for the en-route portion of the flight. Inbound again on a B757-200 with 'Extra Legroom seats' I was seated in row 32 with a window seat next to the Emergency Exit. Return journey could be described as fair only as there was a cold draft of air coming through the Emergency Exit. Both outbound and inbound the GLA based Cabin Crew were kept very busy and were friendly. The Captain's inflight information was good. Inbound he advised that the flight was operating late mainly due head winds on the earlier sector. This delay was almost 'made up' en-route - the time in the air from LPA to GLA being only 4 hours not bad at all! Catering arrangements expensive for what's provided. To conclude as stated previously in an earlier post 6 December 2012 I would not travel with this airline if I had to use standard seats. The 'Extra Legroom' option is OK however if booked to travel on a B757-200 I would avoid an extra legroom window seat due to continuous cold drafts!

I flew to Taba in Egypt in Sep 2012. The flight was the worst flight I have had no entertainment due to the fact Thomson have now stopped this along with the meals. I ordered food from the list when it came you could not eat it due to it being so hard - this was only a toasted cheese sandwich. People were restless due to the fact you sat there for over 5 hours doing nothing due. Staff were over worked. If you do fly with them take your own food and inflight entertainment.

### Thomson Airways customer review
Manchester - Cancun return in Dec. Had never flown Thomson before and after this experience will never want to fly with them again. Flight times: 2hr delay on outbound flight plus the pilot had to take us via a longer route to avoid turbulence - meant we arrived 2.5 hours late into Cancun! Flight back was better with only a 40min late arrival. Food: Cooked food poor and on the inbound flight they had sold out of most snacks and wine by the time they got to our seat - no apology. No free water which is deplorable on a 13hr flight (outbound flight) and a 9hr flight (inbound). Staff service: Could hear flight attendants talking loudly and swearing just before take off and landing (on both flights). Toilets: 2 of the 4 toilets in economy were out of order by the end of the first flight and the part of the plane we were in smelled terrible. Seats: OK. Despite the fact we checked in 2hrs early we weren't able to sit together on the outbound flight but got seats together on the inbound flight as we arrived 3hrs early! Had decent leg room and seat was big enough Entertainment: TV screen quality poor. Films/TV shows on a loop unless you want to pay extra. A number of IFE screens had to be reset (including mine) - which isn't an unexpected thing but the FA was really annoyed when I told him! Kids running around and screaming. Parents were useless and FAs did nothing to help the situation. Overall it was a rather horrific start and end to an otherwise brilliant holiday.

We have always used Thomson for both our short mid and long haul holidays and there seems to be a sudden drop in the flight standards. We flew Manchester to Antalya for a Christmas break and the flight out was ok but the return flight was terrible. Luckily we were prepared with warm clothes snacks and entertainment and I can understand them being short staffed over Christmas but the crew just looked bored. No smiles on boarding no help with loading bags the safety check was non-existent. My window was covered in some sticky pink substance which I had to clean myself as the crew were too busy trying to do 3 booze/food runs during the 4 hour flight to even pay attention. Worst of all was the behaviour of the other passengers kids running up and down the aisle groups of men playing loud music on their phones people hanging over the backs of seats shouting to their mates one kid was playing with a laser pointer and then during landing one passenger was still happily playing with his mobile. The crew never said a word they just sold as much duty-free as they could and then vanished into the back. I cannot fault the service of Thomson staff in-store but this year we will seriously consider choosing another airline.

We flew from Gatwick to Salzburg and back (22/12 and 29/12) on a 737-800. I pre-booked seats together and selected seats 11A and B. Thankfully both flights were short as space was very cramped - my husband is 6 ft 5 and his knees touched the seat in front (I know we could have paid for extra legroom but this is a rip-off especially for a short flight). On boarding at Gatwick we were bussed out to the plane and boarded up a set of steps getting soaked as it was pouring with rain and instead of calling us by seat number they boarded everyone together causing a queue out on the aircraft steps. Late in leaving although no reason was given. As it was a short flight the choice of food was extremely limited - although there was enough time to bring around duty free. On return by the time the food service reached us they were pretty much out of all hot options just managing to rustle up 2 bacon baguettes for £3.90 each - these tasted synthetic and had a measly bit of bacon and nothing else in them. Don't bother to buy food on board either take some from home or buy at the airport - much nicer. On the return flight there was chewing gum stuck to the seat in front of me and a couple of wrappers left lying around. I have flown with Thomson Airway's predecessor Britannia for years and the service has progressively got worse even for a charter airline. It now feels like they are cramming cattle onto planes instead of people - I would certainly think twice about using them in future certainly for any flight over 2 hours long.

### Thomson Airways customer review
How do Thomson Airways really expect customers to return to them now. Our family have been very loyal to them in the past but their 'short' haul flight to Sharm el Sheikh was a diabolical experience in tightly packed conditions. There is no longer in flight entertainment or decent food because it is not considered to be a long enough flight to provide them - it is over 5 hours. When we complained to staff we were told that people did not want them. Are they serious? This is not acceptable to us and will not fly again with them until they change this policy.

### Thomson Airways customer review
Premium Cabin Manchester - Varadero Cuba. Bulkhead seats 3F and 3G and 2A and 2B on return. Do not book these seats in premium cabin. Row 3 is better than row 2 but there is no legroom and you might as well sit in economy. Row 2 is extra squashed and the lights from the galley are bright on a night flight as the curtain is constantly being opened etc. The crew seat is on the other side of the bulkhead so every time the crew got up it banged and woke me up. There is a 'reduced service' and night to 'let you sleep' but they still bring put the duty free etc. The plane was an old First Choice plane that was really tatty. Hopefully the new Dreamliner will be a lot better. Was a horrible return flight and I think we might as well have saved the money and gone economy.

### Thomson Airways customer review
We flew from Cardiff to Sharm el Shiek on 10th Dec 2012 and back on the 17th. This is a 5 hour flight out and 6 hours back. With no inflight entertainment! There were lots of children on board with absolutely nothing to keep them occupied for the flight. This is acceptable for a flight of up to 3 hours but not longer. If there is any alternative to Thomson Holidays in future we will be booking with them.

Have flown with Thomson Glasgow-Funchal for 10 years and noticed a general overall deterioration not only in flight quality etc but in check in times and rush to board at Funchal allowing very little time to relax prior to flight this should not be too difficult to improve. Unfortunately it is Thomson or nothing from Scotland. It would seem that Thomson are ignoring these reviews.

Flew to Madeira from East Midlands. Flight left on time with quite a few spare seats. Very disappointed with the cleanliness of the interior of the plane. Substances were splattered over the tray seat and menu card. When this was brought to the attention of a member of cabin crew I was informed that "it was probably just tomato juice. This is not the first time we have experienced dirty interiors on Thomson flights but feel on this occasion we had to complain.

Flew from Manchester to Tunisia on 2nd December flight was 6am and left at 9.04am - the excuse was staff problems. Arriving at the airport at 4am and having to wait 5 hours is awful but Thomson could not care less. On the plane a 737/800 was ok the seat space was terrible and staff rude and bad tempered. Return journey on the 16th December was a lot better and landed almost on time.

### Thomson Airways customer review
Newcastle to Las Palmas (Gran Canaria) Dec 2012. Both flights on B737-800. Usual Thomson Faux leather seats not the most comfortable. Just because it has recaro written on it doesn't make it comfortable. In flight entertainment was non-existent. Inflight meals non-existent. The outbound aircraft had even had the radio channels disabled in the armrests! Leg room was minimal luckily the person in front of me didn't recline their seats on the outbound or inbound flights. The crew on both flights were professional but are basically just sales people/cleaners. The levels of comfort and service that Thomson now provide would never have been allowed to exist in the days of Britannia before the bottom line became more important than customer service.

### Thomson Airways customer review
EDI-ACE-EDI. Both outbound and inbound journeys fairly comfortable on a B757-200 having paid for 'Extra Legroom Seats'. I would not travel on this airline if I had to use standard seats as the pitch is 'tight' at around 28''. The food and drink for purchase was reasonable in quality but rather highly priced in my opinion. Cabin crew GLA based were kept busy throughout and were friendly. Flights operated on time. Hold baggage arrival a bit slow at EDI perhaps as aircraft was parked on a remote stand?

### Thomson Airways customer review
Thomson used to be one of the best airlines for short haul - how things have changed. Flight to Sharm El Sheikh with nothing more to do than look at the seat in front of me! I will never fly them again unless they bring back the Inflight Entertainment and the proper Inflight meal.

18.11.12 MAN-PFO on board B757-200. Our 9am slot was delayed twice for air traffic control reasons even though we were all onboard at 8.50am. At 9.50am taxied onto the runway braked heavily taxied off and stopped. Repairs completed about 11.15am and then pilot had to wait for fuel top up. At 11.30am fuelling completed and then another air traffic delay. Eventually took off 12 noon and once in the air were offered a small carton of orange and a 2 finger KitKat to compensate for the 3 hours we had already sat on this old aircraft with no individual air conditioning vents and one of the smallest seat pitches in the industry. With the 4.5 hour flight we spent 7.5 on that aircraft. Unfortunately our return 2 weeks later was on the same aircraft but at least we got off on time. Never again.

London Gatwick to Male direct flight out 25 Nov 2012 flight back Male to London Gatwick on 3rd December 2012. I should of realised things had changed when we first had to pay £30 extra each to sit next to each other (total £60) having paid just under £4000 for the one week package holiday. Next the baggage allowance of 20 kg checked and 5 kg hand luggage - fortunately we under so no charge. Checked in 2 bags told the one with 2 wheels was OK but the one with 4 wheels would need to be checked in as 'oversized baggage'. When I politely refused they accepted the 4 wheel case but told me it would be my fault if it didn't arrive at our destination it arrived as expected. Boarded and took off on time. All tea coffee (except with a meal) was charged extra all water beers wines spirits were extra. The service was the worst ever and the food awful. The cabin staff are rude and rush through the cabin. The aircraft and crew were the same on the return. Return flight took off 1 hour late. Crew and attendants arrived late. Service was better but still not good. At check in at Male Airport the Thomson check in assistant kept our landing cards which we later needed to pass through border control. The cabin was freezing my wife asked for the temperature to be increased on 2 occasions and no change all passengers were wrapped in blankets. Cabin Manager did offer us an entertainment upgrade but I used my ipod anyway. Thomson you have taken the pleasure out of travel and taken economy to a level.

London Gatwick to Puerto Plata (Dominican Republic) on 22nd of November and returned on 30th of November. The Long haul product was fantastic. The flight out was very long due to head winds but the 767 used whilst being full was still very open and airy. The flight home was a bit of a surprise as the plane that we were supposed to fly home on had one of its emergency slides deployed after landing and after the allotted boarding time had passed we were told by the Captain that unfortunately the plane could not fly with a full complement of passenger and that 50 people would have to be left behind to legally fly. As this was not an option for the Captain all 258 of us were put up over night in a 4 star hotel. Staff were fantastic answering all questions and keeping us informed at all times. A 15 hour delay and most was spent in a very nice hotel. We still returned on the Friday but at 8pm rather than 6am. I found the food very nice and plentiful however take lots of money for drinks. The in-flight entertainment looked good and varied but I listened to my iPod and slept so didn't use it. All in all I was very impressed and would fly long haul again with them.

What a change a year makes having used Thomson for the last 5 years of holidays which have all been excellent we decided we would have no problems booking our August honeymoon to Cyprus. The flights there and back were a complete nightmare! Our outbound flight we found out that the in-flight entertainment and in-flight meals had been scrapped on short haul flights. We only found out about this 3 hours into the flight when we questioned the stewardess when the meals were being served. At this point all hot food had been done with so we had to settle with cold cream teas. On the return flight with the knowledge of the meals situation on the plane we knew we had to purchase them during the hot meals service. Due to our seating location on row 24 E and F by the time the meal trolleys from both ends of the plane had reached our seats they had run out of practically everything. Only Soups and a few snack pots where left. There was several items on the menu that where not even available at the start of the flight. Not the comprehensive snacks menu you see in the brochure. The overall feel of the flights was of a cheap budget company. Not the sort of flight we expected to get for what we had paid for. Never again with Thomson!

Flew LGW-ACE on 13th November ageing B757 AW The seats were so close that when the person in front reclined the seat back it hit my right knee. I really cannot see how this airline can have certification for such a seating plan. God forbid in an emergency situation I cannot see how you could exit quickly. Very expensive food no entertainment rude staff. The return flight was a tad better ACE-LGW 27th November solely because the aircraft was a newer B737-800 however it was still cramped. I will not travel with Thomson again in these conditions.

We have travelled on many Thomson flights/holidays with and without children and used to look forward to the flight as the first part of our holiday. Not any more. What an endurance test! The seats are so cramped hard and uncomfortable. Doing exercises to prevent DVT impossible! With the unsubtle removal of the back- of-the-seat-storage nets to try to create a feeling of more leg room we were left with nowhere to put book glasses and ever-needed purse/wallet. The cabin staff (sales girls) had to start by going through the plane offering "comfort bags" at a mere £5! (containing a blanket pillow). Drinks are dispensed slowly as "food" items are sold at the same time. We were 1.5 hours into our flight before we had a drink which were expensive eg gin/tonic £5.20. The "food" on offer was horrible. Please bring back the hot meals - we don't mind paying a few pounds for them. Our 4.5 hour flight had no entertainment music radio or film. Overall a huge disappointment and takes cost-cutting to new depths. Worse than many of the low cost carriers.

Took 90 minutes to get through check-in at Sharm El Sheilkh. One check-in desk for LGW TOM235 queues getting muddled then refusing to open extra check-in desks. Tempers were frayed flights getting delayed and some passengers getting checked in with flights wating. Thomson reps just leaning on desks with head in hands! Thomas Cook check-ins just sailed through. After 40 years and many a trip to Sharm never seen it as bad as that. Why have all those flights on one day the airport is not that busy on other days. Never again!

### Thomson Airways customer review
Avoid this airline on short haul at all costs. The comfort entertainment food customer service by cabin crew are deplorable. As it was a short haul flight there was no choice of cabin class. If you cannot get extra leg room you need to be a midget. The food is disgusting. We were most upset with the care and attention of the cabin crew they showed none. I felt like an inconvenience to them. I will never fly with this airline again.

Flew Barbados to Gatwick as part of charter P and O post cruise package. Paid to upgrade to PE and paid another £15 to secure two seats together which seems a rip off. This has to rate as one of the worst flights I've ever done. Apart from fresh fruit the food was virtually inedible coffee and tea so strong that a bitter taste was left in my mouth. No extra pillows offered and the seat was hard with a very limited recline. My bulkhead seat had less leg room to stretch out than I have in BA's economy. I dread to think what economy seats must have been like if this was my experience in PE. Never again. 8 hours in this discomfort is totally unacceptable.

Flew Manchester to Sharm on 8/11/12 and returned 22/11/12. Flight out OK as we had 3 seats between two of us. Flight back really uncomfortable due to poor cramped seating. We knew about the new catering arrangements and took our own food on both journeys as the Thomson offerings seem poor value for money. The lack of entertainment on a 6 hour flight is a joke. Staff on both flights were OK but they are obviously under orders to make as much money as possible.

Flew to Cape Verde in July and after reading comments regarding the aircraft and leg room felt compelled to write a review. 757-200 series was old cramped and had no leg room whatsoever. Middle Toilet was blocked resulting in large queues and they ran out of tea and coffee on return journey. Again no in flight entertainment even though the flight was 5.5 hours long. After this flight I will be seriously considering flying Thomson again unless you pay for an upgraded seat or happen to be lucky and sit behind the toilet block where there is plenty of leg room!

Manchester - Marsa Alam 06/11/12 return 20/11/12. No premium economy cabin available on either flight. Suffered nearly six hours in unbelievable cramped conditions as far too many seats are crammed into the aircraft. Situation made worse when passenger in front of me decided to "fully" recline his seat further reducing what little space I had. Warm wine with tasteless microwaved panini was very expensive. In flight entertainment non existent. Cabin crew on return flight considered far from "friendly" saving any smiles for disembarkation.

Flight out from Manchester the Sharm at 13.55 on 2nd November good size plane. Warm enough. Staff friendly helpful and efficient. Very disappointed about no in flight entertainment. We expected it so packed the books in the suitcases. Couldn't hear anything the captain was telling us over the tannoy because he was too quiet. Return flight 9th November 18.30. Delayed an hour but nobody was told in fact at 7.15 pm the screens showed our flight departed which was a bit disconcerting. We got into the smallest most uncomfortable plane I've ever been on. Cramped to the point every time the rude staff went up and down the aisle I got knocked sideways. The seats reclined to the point where the person in front was laid on you. I'm 5ft2 and my knees were touching the seat in front. Staff were rude and inefficient. The plane was freezing. Given the choice I will never fly Thomson again. 6 hours if far too long to be cold uncomfortable and have nothing to take your mind off it.

Flew Manchester to Sharm 7/11/12 returned 14/11/12. Flight out day flight cabin was unbearably hot - they sold lots of drinks return flight night flight cabin freezing - they were selling fleece blankets. Is this a coincidence? Service going out was ok but return flight was poor they ran out of chips no fresh sandwiches and we were row 7. Seating is unbelievably tight and the seats still recline which makes the space between you and the person in front unacceptable. We are frequent flyers on budget Airlines and know what to expect and have become accustomed to service levels so it came as a shock that Thomsons fell far below our expectations and indeed the levels we enjoy from budget airlines. We would never recommend Thomson and we would avoid using them again.

### Thomson Airways customer review
Flew GLA to Sharm El Sheikh on 27th Oct - back on 5th Nov. Flight out was bearable mainly due to it being only 70% full - we had 3 seats between 2 people so could stretch out. No warning that there would be no in-flight entertainment - 6 hours is a long time to pass with no distractions. Having been ripped off for excess baggage at check-in we were further stiffed by the price of in-flight food - although in fairness the chicken sandwiches were edible. However return journey was a nightmare. Fully loaded it also felt as if an extra row had been put in the front cabin. Added to the joys of a child kicking the back of my seat a faulty tray table led to my husband wearing more of his drinks than he managed to consume and both of us struggled to get into any sort of position where we could be remotely comfortable. These seats are obviously designed with smaller than average passengers in mind. The worst aspect of the flight home was the food. Very little on offer. If we ever have to resort to flying with this company again we'll take a cool-bag and buy sandwiches at the airport.

MAN - Montego Bay on 767 G-OOBK. Ex First Choice Aircraft. To sum up - "The Big Sale". You pay for everything except your meal and one cup of tea or coffee. Even water costs. They do a bar service first so you do not receive your meal until at least a good hour after departure. Then its Duty Free sales followed by 2 or 3 further bar runs. IFE is on a loop unless you want to pay an extra £5 to upgrade to the On Demand system. This uses the same screen and handset on the seat back. They just go to the back of the cabin and punch in your seat number. You get issued with a head set once which you have to keep for the way home. If you lose it then you have to pay for another set. An adapter is included and required if you want to use your own headset.

BHX - Antalya - TOM253 Boeing 757-200 (same plane inbound / outbound). What's happened to Thomson Airways? - It seems in the space of a year it has become a flying cash register. We were unprepared for a 4.5 flight as I had not read or seen anywhere that inflight entertainment had been cut from the budget for this year. Apparently no-one watched it according to the cabin staff however on both inbound and outbound I counted the 18 seats around me and only one person had anything to do. The past inflight meals were garbage but at least edible on occasions and were actually something you looked forward to but the simple thing is its paid for as part of your initial holiday cost - it just does not feel right paying cash at inflated prices for something that represents less value than the old style inflight meals. Seats are small you can see where the rows are altered against the window alignment. One steward seemed really grumpy on the outbound but was smiling on the inbound but as we were last flight of the day for the team they were as keen to get home as us.

Flew premium economy long haul to the Caribbean we made an excellent decision to go premium! Staff were very helpful and kept us supplied with drinks. If staff weren't serving you could always ask for a drink or snack and they'd organise something. Leg room was fantastic even when passenger in front reclined their seat lots of space to stretch out. Complimentary pack was useful but not essential. Blankets issued on both outward and return flights with neck pillow neither were used on outward flight but were good for the night flight home. Seat width more than adequate and seat was fairly firm fine on the outward day flight but on the return overnight I found the seat very hard after a few hours. However sitting on the neck pillow helped. The only criticism I have was that the film choices were very poor and fairly old. Also the plane interior was showing signs of age the seat storage fell apart easily and spilt contents on the floor some neck rests wouldn't adjust on some seats. However I really enjoyed flying Thomson and would recommend premium economy to anyone flying long haul.

Manchester-Funchal and return onboard B757-200 series. Seat pitch dreadful - tatty interior and not clean. Large wad of paper towels stuffed in trim above window about row 3 and signs of some liquid having run along the bulkhead. Roof drop down screen (no longer used) but held together with black and yellow tape. Latest announcement from the captain included reference to no more than 1 passenger to queue for front toilet for security reasons. Probably because it slows down cabin staff pushing trolleys up and down trying to sell very overpriced and poor quality food and drink. Can't avoid flying with this second rate airline when going on a package holiday booked with Thomson.

### Thomson Airways customer review
BHX-Zakynthos-BHX. Both journeys comfortable. However due to my height I paid for extra legroom seats and if the day ever comes when Thomson will not allow me to do this perhaps because of age I will have to stop using them. Even though airline food on charters is not great it was infinitely preferable to the offering currently available. IFE - I don't think there was any.

EMA-LAS PALMAS (15-10-2012) return 22-10-2012. A very uncomfortable experience and disgraceful legroom for a 4 hour flight. The crew advise moving around during the flight but this would be impossible. Drinking water is ill advised as it is almost impossible to get out of your seat to get to the toilet this increases the risk of DVT.

Just back from Crete and flew Thomson Airways on a 757-200 both ways. They really are just another budget airline and far from the best may I add. Gone are the flight meals and the inflight entertainment and in comes a trolley of overpriced microwave slop. I've flown Thomson long haul for the last 2 years and they are like night and day compared to the short haul product. The legroom is ridiculous verging on unbearable if the passenger in front reclines onto your lap.

LGW to Bodrum. Outbound 8th October return to LGW 15th October. Full flights both ways. First Choice A321. Seat pitch tight. Cabin staff on both sectors worked hard and were pleasant. Didn't bother with food or drink as too expensive. Lack of IFE not a problem as had reading material. Flight Deck info was clear and informative on both flights. Only problem was both flights left and arrived at the farthest gate at LGW making for a very long walk. Overall not brilliant legroom but you get what you pay for.

My wife and I flew out to Mahon on the 3rd October returning on the 10th to Manchester. Flights there and back on a full 737-800. Flight out was fine almost on time and uneventful. The Captain gave the passengers fairly regular flight updates and I would say most passengers were quite satisfied with things. Flight home about the same but the cabin crew were a little more 'in your face' when it came to selling stuff. We didn't buy any on board food as is was too expensive and the flights were only a couple of hours in any case. My only real complaint concerns the lack of leg room; this airline really does 'pack em in' tightly. Not that bothered about lack of in flight entertainment or an airline meal but having flown with Thomson many times dating back to the Britannia days I will say without hesitation that the overall product and flight experience is not the same; it is something more akin to the other low cost carriers and Thomson should take note of this.

Travel long haul to Montego Bay in May and again in September. I have travelled many times to Montego Bay with Thomsons and have seen the condition of the cabins and food get worse and worse. The planes are old and due to the delay with the delivery of the B787 they are getting even worse. Thomson should have upgraded the cabins but seem to spend money on promoting the B787. On our flight back to the UK we had to watch a video on how good it would be to be one of the first to fly the new B787. I have sat on better park benches and at this point in time I will not fly Thomson Airways again. There were 4 in my party and the extra cost was £179 per person.

I travelled to Florida May 2011 with Thomson premium seating I could not fault it. We have just returned on 28th September flying with Thomson premium seating. This time I wish we had not - it was an old first choice 767. The only difference I could see from premium and the rear cabin seats was the distance from the seat in front the seats were very hard and uncomfortable. I doubt very much if I will be travelling long haul again with Thomson.

Outbound flight from Belfast International Airport to Las Palmas was on time and the cabin crew very attentive no complaints. The return flight back from Las Palmas to Belfast International Airport was very disappointing due to a long delay of over 4 hrs. We boarded the flight an hour late and after the safety brief by the cabin crew the jet engines that were revving to go were shut down. A couple of minutes later the Pilot came on tannoy to explain he had to shut them down because there was a technical problem and the parking brake would not release. We were stuck on the plane for 3hrs because according to the Pilot the plane was registered in Canada and the Spanish airplane mechanics refused to fix the problem for this reason. The pilot was not to blame and kept us informed of progress although passengers were becoming restless and angry by the delay. Fortunately the problem which in all intents and purposes was probably minor was fixed after 3 hrs and the plane eventually took off. I urge Thomson Airways to review the logic of using aircraft that are registered to another country outside of Europe for this causes added problems and delays.

Dreadful food and unbelievably bad customer service on our flight home. I flew from Sharm El Sheik to Luton on 26.9.12. Despite it being a 5 hour flight there was no meal included so I bought a bacon baguette to eat. The baguette had been in the heater for so long that it was rock hard so I gave up trying to eat the bread and pulled out the single piece of bacon. It was revolting so I ate none of it. When the stewardess came to collect the waste I gave her the uneaten baguette and told her it was disgusting. Her response was not 'sorry' not 'can we offer you something else' and not 'would you like your money back'. Her response was 'do you want to fill in a feedback form'. If that is how Thomson train their staff to respond to a complaint they have much to learn about customer service.

I regularly fly to Cyprus with Thomson but was none too happy when my return flight was arranged with Jet2.com Thomson charged me £320 for my flight and I found out from other passengers (on the Jet2 flight) that they had paid circa £180 for their flights with Jet2. What a rip off - no meals no entertainment and they arrange a budget airline for the return flight. I have flown with Thomson for over 20 years but they have now lost me as a customer.

I was unfortunate enough to fly from Tenerife South to Manchester early morning on the 3rd of October. The Boeing 767 was packed and I was sitting behind a woman who thought it would be fun to slam her reclining seat hard into my knees which because of poor leg room and my height (1.88m) were touching the back of her seat. I told her that her reclined seat was causing me pain. At this point a member of the cabin crew arrived. After informing him of the problem he told me that she was quite within her rights to move the back of her seat and that I should have informed Thomson of my knee problem before the flight. He then went away and did nothing further until after an hour of agony my wife insisted that another seat be found for me. This he grudgingly did. Whilst I have to concede that there are people in this country who are prepared to let others endure over 4 hours of agony whilst they lay back in comfort. I do not expect this behaviour to be condoned by Airline staff.

Gatwick to Marsa Alam return on a fairly new packed 737 both ways. Both flights left on time and arrived early. On both flights the cabin crew worked hard to ensure every passenger was able to buy food / drinks / duty free etc and cannot be faulted in their diligence or cheerfulness.

Exeter to Tenerife and return in a 737-800. Took off on time and arrived at both destinations early. Got the seats we selected and the only problem was the leg room which I found a bit tight but managed the 4 hours without any aches and pains. The cabin was very clean and the CC were pleasant but very busy. Cockpit kept us well informed throughout the flights. All in all not bad flights.

### Thomson Airways customer review
BFS-PMI. Quick check-in at both airports pleasant crew meal is expensive but nice and fresh. B737-800 was clean so were the toilet facilities there is no entertainment as its short haul flight. We had pre-booked our seats in front rows so had enough legroom.

We flew from Glasgow to Cape Verde islands Boa Vista like most people the plane was very cramped. It took around 6.5 hours to get there we did get the usual meal but again no inflight entertainment. Coming home we were advised we didn't have enough fuel to get home and had to stop at Gran Canaria (for one hour) to re-fuel. Again we got food but no entertainment and the flight was just over seven hours in total. Not a great flight in either direction but like a lot of people there is less and less choice in holiday companies available unfortunately.

### Thomson Airways customer review
Travelled from East Midlands to Sharm and I don't think I have ever been more uncomfortable on a plane. There was absolutely no room to move and the staff had forgotten to smile. Thomson proudly boast they take more people on holiday than any other airline it is likely the also do this on fewer aircraft's!

Return from Gatwick to Luxor 12 and 19th September 2012. At 1.95 m the seating plan made the trip absolute torture. My wife is 1.58m and had very little room to spare - when a seat reclined she had her first attack of claustrophobia on an airplane ever. Cabin crew expertise extend only as far as selling overpriced horrible food booze and cigarettes. Other airlines shift passengers around for the sake of comfort and safety when things are tight - quite infuriating when some passengers were allowed to sleep across 3 seats when others cant even sit with their legs pointing forward. Check in staff on the 12th at Gatwick were rude and dictatorial. Paid 24 pounds for being 2 kgs (combined between my wife and I) over what was a pathetic baggage allowance. We travelled with them as 'holiday experts' but really every aspect we can do ourselves.

### Thomson Airways customer review
Flight Luxor-Gatwick 5.5 hours (plus 1.5 hours kept on plane by Port Authority) As others have commented absolutely no room whatsoever to read or attempt comfort and I and a friend are only 5ft 1". My husband and another friend both 6ft 2" struggled in pain. Crew knock you sideways in your seat every time they whizz through the aisle with no apology. The seat space is criminal. Food - what food? They told us they didn't have anything as the previous flight had had it all. But they have alcohol at an extortionate cost even tea and coffee are charged for! Crew - manners were obviously alien to them. Night flight lights were left on - but you won't get comfortable enough to sleep anyway.

London Gatwick - Antalya return - Boeing 767. Overall this was OK. We used the day before check in at Gatwick which was superb - no queues and on the day just turned up at Gatwick and went straight to security. Boarding at Gatwick was by row which meant no hassle on the plane. At Antalya boarding was a free for all and a bit messy. We sat towards the back of the plane both ways and at 6'2" I had enough legroom! Certainly more legroom on the 767 than the 757's. TV screens in all seat backs however nothing shown other than the 5 different Thomson images for the entire flight. They could at least have put the map on to show where we were flying over. Cabin Crew were fine and friendly both ways but what lets the Thomson holiday experience down is the onboard service. Food portions were small and quite expensive for what you got. Drinks prices were very expensive. Luggage limits are also small so you're forced to pay more. The whole Thomson airways short haul feel is a low cost and tacky. There's nothing to get you in the holiday mood on board. All other elements of the Thomson package are slick and glossy apart from the flights.

We flew out to Paphos in Cyprus with my disabled father with Thomson on 9th September and the return flight on 16th September was Monarch. We were given no information why this happened the cabin crew were more interested in reading magazines than seeing to the passengers boarding the aircraft. As for my father who has a prosthetic leg he was told that he could not sit in the aisle seat in row 3 as it was required for an able bodied person in case of an emergency but no other aisle seat was offered which made his journey uncomfortable with my father having to remove his prosthetic leg. On disembarking the aircraft we had requested airport assistance but were told just to make our way to the doors of the aircraft where we would be met by porters with wheelchairs along with everyone else leaving the aircraft not an easy proposition for a 80 year old disabled person. The cabin crew were less than helpful not like Thomson who were excellent. Would not voluntarily use Monarch again but had no choice in this case.

BOH to PMI TOM B737-800 (Sky interior). Check in 6am was very easy and through to Departures very quickly. Boarded and ready to go on time but an ATC delay of 15mins. Flight and service fine seating fine plane very new so clean and tidy. Landed at PMI 10 mins early and bussed to terminal. Very busy inside with a good 40 min wait for luggage but probably not TOM fault.

Newcastle to Larnaca paid £50 for extra leg room seats put in row 32f next to emergency exit  no room due to bulk head on door. Spent the whole duration of flight with my legs stretched over guy in next seat. On return flight Larnaca to Newcastle I was put in row 32 again but seat D an aisle seat - plenty of leg room but spent the whole flight getting battered on the shoulder by crew members rampaging up and down plane without any apologies.

We flew to Sharm el Sheik from Glasgow. I wasn't really prepared for the lack of food and drink and on board entertainment as had assumed wrongly a near 6hr flight would warrant at least some entertainment and some water. Seats were very cramped and the cabin crew did their best with what they had. On the way back seats were slightly better as they'd moved the seat back pockets to the headrest which was a way to create an inch extra leg room. However the flight left Egypt 20mins late at nearly 10pm and the cabin crew decided to try and sell us duty free at 1am in the morning loudly proclaiming we should all purchase stuff. They didn't turn the lights off until after 2am. On arrival back to Glasgow at 2.30am GMT we then proceeded to stand around for 75 mins until our bags came out 1 by 1. I guess having one or two baggage handlers seemed fine on paper. I have also since found out that I could have flown Egypt Air from London to Cairo and got an internal flight to Sharm for at least £100 less than this flight and would have got entertainment and food/drink. Its such a shame as Sharm is a lovely destination to be spoilt by the flying experience.

Booked to fly from Dublin to Verona on 8th September flight delayed by 7 hours all we received by way of compensation was a pathetic 8 euro voucher - you couldn't fill your stomach with 8 euro and not even an apology. Arrived eventually at our hotel at 4 in the morning with a two year old baby. You could put it down to bad luck - planes get delayed but never did we imagine that on our return journey on 15th September back to Dublin we are delayed again flight due to leave at 8.25pm and at this stage we don't even know if the flight will run at all - one minute we told the flight will leave at 2am now we are hearing it's been cancelled altogether - this can't be bad luck again. No one to come and explain the situation and leaving people frustrated and angry. A shocking bad airline one we will never use again.

Flew from Gatwick to Sharm el Sheikh in August. Outbound flight 4.45 hrs very cramped no in flight entertainment expensive drinks pilot kept us informed. Return flight was 5 hours 20 mins very hot lack of in flight entertainment really let's Thomson down on longer flights very cramped seats. Plus side both flights took off on time and cabin crew were good.

### Thomson Airways customer review
Birmingham to Antalya Turkey - very cramped conditions for a 4.5 hour flight. No legroom the seats were very uncomfortable. My husband is 6'2" and was in pain. This cannot be legal to cram so may people into such a small space. We have never had a problem in the past with both Thomson and First Choice but will consider other airlines in the future. This is not value for money and I now consider them a budget airline.

### Thomson Airways customer review
Larnaca to Bristol Sept 2nd 2012. So little space. I am amazed its actually legal to cram so many people so close together on a flight of over 4 hours duration. We flew out Thomas Cook and I had no complaints. The return journey I had very little room and I am only 5'2". My hubby of 5'10" had his knees in the seat in front the whole journey. I put the tray down and it was touching my midriff then I tried to read the inflight magazine and it was difficult to turn a page over as one end was in my midriff and one end touching the seat in front. Thomson will be my last choice from now on I paid almost as much for these flights as a friend paid for her holiday so it wasn't a cheap option.

### Thomson Airways customer review
5.5 hr flight to Egypt 767-300 2-4-2 config. Uncomfortable and cramped seats as others have mentioned absolutely no entertainment free or paid no option for inflight meals not even a map to show where you we're. Blankets etc now charged for. Thomson are now a budget airline unbearable on anything over 2-3 hours. Please bring back the entertainment or at least let us to choose to pay or not.

### Thomson Airways customer review
Appalling flight to and from Egypt simply not an acceptable level of comfort for an almost 6 hour flight. Seats cramped no legroom and if the person in front reclines their seat you cannot even put your table down. No entertainment expensive and not really edible heated snacks. Staff did their best and were pleasant enough but this really is cattle truck travel at its worst. Compare this to any other airline flying to Egypt where even in the poorest economy seat there is a level of comfort unheard of in a Thomson flight. Would I fly Thomson long haul again? Never.

### Thomson Airways customer review
Very cramped seating on 757 NCL to Gran Canaria - 4hrs 20 mins flight. Inflight drinks and food were a total rip off. Fly easyjet or jet2 as they are the premium carriers now.

### Thomson Airways customer review
When booking with Thomson I thought we were going to be flying with an above low budget. I thought wrong they are no better than the low budget airlines trying to cut back saving themselves a few pounds. We flew to Tenerife South from EMA in August 2012 the Thomson flight there was nice decent leg room and nice cabin crew. Though my boyfriend paid for some food (what a waste of money) chips were all stuck together and the chicken wrap where was the chicken? Also no air-conditioning which was not a noticeable problem when flying out. However on the way home the plane was hot and stuffy and very uncomfortable. Cabin crew staff were quite rude bumping into passengers and not saying sorry etc. I would not recommend flying them unless you have to fly less than 2.5 hours as it is unbearable. For saying we paid a lot of money for the flight we really didn't get our moneys worth. Disappointed.

### Thomson Airways customer review
Glasgow to Paphos August 2012. B757-200 aircraft with no seat pockets to give a little more legroom but nowhere to store water bottles etc. Seats were very tight and I'm not over five foot nine. When the person in front reclines it's awful as the small pocket is now at the top and in your face! Check in at both airports uneventful. Staff pleasant on both flights. Two cans of coke came to 6 euros and the excuse for a sandwich that was a fiver was not a patch on the Boots meal deal bought at the airport. Buy food and drink before you go. At Paphos buy pop and water at the newsagents it's cheaper. Flights both on time. Lack of in flight entertainment puts this flight in budget class and five hours is a long time when you have nothing to do.

### Thomson Airways customer review
Flew to Tenerife from Gatwick. Thomson Airlines are now simply a budget airline. Think of everything a budget airline offers and Thomson have it: No inflight entertainment rip off meals and drinks and extremely squashed up seats. Use to enjoy Thomson flights but never again!

### Thomson Airways customer review
Manchester to Sanford Orlando 10th August in Premium cabin. Both flights on time reasonably comfortable seat food not too bad free drinks decent afternoon tea on the outbound flight. IFE acceptable. The people who complain about the premium class on this site should understand its not Business class they should use Virgin or BA at 4 or 5 times the cost of the Thomson flights.

### Thomson Airways customer review
Recently flew Thomson/First Choice to Orlando from Birmingham on July 28th on 767-300. Both ways good service and the flight was on time. I was a little bit disappointed at the fact we were flying on a First Choice aircraft as every time I'd flown First Choice the seats were extremely uncomfortable. However I found that the seat was actually quite comfortable and spacious. Cabin crew were friendly and me and my family had a pleasant trip to and from Orlando Sanford!
