### "beyond a real disaster"
This airline is something beyond a real disaster, on January 29 I traveled with my wife and my two twin children, each one and a half years old, on the Bogota - Caracas route, first of all I paid well in advance for a fare that supposedly included 3 suitcases in the hold and when I check in at the airport they recognize only one suitcase and charge me for 2 in the modest sum of $300 and as if it were shortly after charging me they tell me that they will leave them on standby and possibly not sent, they decide at the time of loading the plane whether to assemble them or not. This is not to mention that the checkup takes forever and in the meantime they mistreat you severely. (The staff is very unqualified). After checking in, they issue me my 4 boarding passes and the seats are assigned to me with numbers and letters, leaving them all together. Later, minutes before boarding the plane, an airline staff approached me in a very disrespectful manner, without giving me any explanation, they asked me for the boarding pass that they had issued to me and arbitrarily changed my seats, completely separating my family. They leave my wife with one of my children in a middle seat in row 3 and they put me in a middle seat in row 4. The worst part is that I had paid an additional amount to choose my seats and this way to be all together; I tried to demand some explanation and they just told me it's like this or you don't travel, this is not negotiable and that's it, they turned around and left me talking alone. Immediately after boarding the plane, I spoke with the flight attendant explaining my situation and asking him to help me solve it since my children did not understand why they had been separated from their mother, to which they only responded that we cannot do anything, this is a Low airline. Cost, which is totally false because they even charge you for breathing, and the tickets are very expensive, where they are quite low is in the treatment of the passenger and the services they provide, where they are very very low. In short, if you want to be badly mistreated and scammed, this is the perfect airline. The seats are super small, the staff is rude, no one solves anything, when it comes to dealing with a disaster, I absolutely do not recommend it to anyone. Esta aerolínea es algo mas allá a un verdadero desastre, el 29 de Enero viaje con mi esposa y mis dos hijos mellizos de año y medio cada uno, en la ruta Bogota - Caracas, en primer lugar pague con suficiente antelación una tarifa que supuestamente incluía 3 maletas en bodega y al realizar el check in en el aeropuerto me reconocen una sola maleta y me cobran 2 en la modica suma de $300 y como si fuera poco después de cobrarme me dicen que las dejaran en standby y posiblemente no las envien, ellos en el momento de cargar el avión deciden si las montan o no. Esto sin contar que en el chequeo demoran una eternidad y en ese interin te maltratan fuertemente. (El personal es muy poco calificado). Luego de chequearnos me emiten mis 4 boarding pass y se me asignan los asientos con numero y letras quedando todos juntos. Posteriormente minutos antes de abordar el avion se me acerca de manera muy irrespetuosa un personal de la aerolínea , las cuales sin darme explicación alguna me piden los boarding pass que me habian emitido y me cambian arbitrariamente de asientos separando por completo a mi familia, es decir, dejan a mi esposa con uno de mis hijos en un asiento del medio en la fila 3 y a mi me colocan en un asiento del medio en la fila 4. Lo peor del caso es que yo habia pagado una cantidad adicional para elegir mis asientos y de esta manera estar todos juntos; trate de exigir alguna explicación y solo me dijeron es asi o no viajas esto no es negociable y punto se voltearon y me dejaron hablando solo. Seguidamente después de abordar el Avion converse con el personal de sobrecargo explicandole mi situación y solicitándole me ayude a resolver ya que mis hijos no entendían porque los habian separado de su madre, a lo cual solo me respondieron no podemos hacer nada esto es una aerolínea Low Cost, lo cual es totalmente falso porque te cobran hasta por respirar, y los tickets son carísimos, en lo que si son bastante Low es en el trato al pasajero y en los servicios que prestan, en eso si son very very low. En resumen si quieren ser fuertemente maltratados y estafados, esta es la aerolínea perfecta. Los asientos super pequeños, el personal mal encarado, nadie resuelve nada, en el momento de abordar un desastre, no se la recomiendo absolutamente a nadie.

### "It is a total robbery"
It is a total robbery. Today I took out 4 tickets for my relatives who fly Havana to Panama economy class one way and go plus on the way back after having made the confirmation and paying 1994.81 dollars, I called to be sure that everything was fine and they told me that the The one-way ticket was not confirmed because it was unexpected and there were no appointments in that class. To cancel the ticket, I had to pay 200 dollars, but as for the return ticket, if there was one, it had happened and if I canceled it, I also had to pay 200 dollars for person means that they were only going to return me about 78 dollars, in short I had no other option but to pay 250 dollars more for people for a ticket that I had just bought and it is not my fault that the agency found it is a lack of respect because It wasn't my fault and then I went to the page and they were still selling the economy class so I imagine that could have happened to many. Anyway I had to pay 1000 dollars more just to change the class 250 for people this is incredible. Es un robo total hoy saqué 4 pasajes para mi familiares que vuelan habana cuba a Panamá clase económica de ida y go plus de regreso después de haber hecho la confirmación y pagar 1994.81 dólares llame para estar segura de que todo estaba bien y me dijeron que el boleto de ida no estaba confirmado porq estaba sobrevenido y que no quedaban haciéndose en esa clase para cancelar el boleto tenía que pagar 200 dólares pero como para el boleto de regreso si había ese si había pasado y si lo cancelaba también tenía que pagar 200 dólares por persona quiere decir que solo me iban a regresar como 78 dólares en fin no tuve otra opción que pagar 250 dólares más por personas un boleto que lo había acabado de comprar y no tengo la culpa que la agencia lo halla sobrevenido es una falta de respeto porque no fue mi culpa y después entré a la página y seguían vendiendo la clase económica así que me imagino que eso le pudo haber pasado a muchos.en fin tuve que pagar 1000 dólares más solo por cambiar la clase 250 por personas esto está increíble.

### "forced to pay for a carry-on"
My recent experience with this airline was nothing short of appalling. First, when departing from the Dominican Republic, they did not charge me for a carry-on bag, which was the one positive aspect of my trip. However, they made up for it by charging me simply because their system gave me an error code (404) and I couldn't download my e-ticket. Instead of offering a solution, they charged me for the "privilege" of printing a boarding pass. On my return from Medellín, the situation worsened. The flight attendants displayed an astonishing lack of professionalism. They attempted to charge me for a carry-on bag, which clearly fit within their sizing guidelines. I had to insist it was indeed a carry-on. Despite this, they claimed another bag was not "purchased" as a carry-on, forcing me to pay triple just to bring a clearly valid bag on board. Absolutely absurd. The attitude of a flight attendant was particularly disturbing—rude, condescending, and giving passengers disdainful looks paired with a hostile tone. Her behavior was not only unprofessional but also incredibly disrespectful. The most shocking incident occurred when I was forced to pay yet again for a carry-on, and this time they wouldn’t accept American Express or even U.S. cash. To add insult to injury, the attendant had the audacity to suggest I leave my bag behind and fly without it! The sheer absurdity of this situation is mind-blowing. The way this airline operates is beyond belief. Passengers are being nickel-and-dimed at every opportunity and subjected to poor treatment because people don't stand up for themselves. This airline's practices are unethical and, frankly, disgraceful.

### "going to pay to check it in"
Not Verified |   I paid extra to check in my baggage but the ladies at the gate counter first told me it was too thick and then did not proceed to help me with next steps and when I finally asked they rudely told me I’m going to pay to check it in. I asked whether something could be done since I had already paid for it to be a carry on and to use that money but they simply said no and that I have to pay again and will not get that money back- no explanations.

### "not really a low-budget airline"
They charged me 100€ to drop off my non-oversized, non-overweight baggage. Do I need to say more? They also charged me 5€ for check-in? Check-in, an obviously included service at every other airline. These extra costs ended up being more expensive than the actual flight. As you can see, Wingo is not really a low-budget airline at all and, everything added up, I've flown cheaper with LATAM.

### "I wasn’t able to fly"
Travel with Wingo has been the worst experience. At the airport they don’t allow us to self checked even when we were 3 hours before the flight, they asked for US$40 per person for the checking on the counter, the website said US$18. I wasn’t able to fly to Venezuela because I don’t have a Visa so I decided to get at least the taxes back. The First Reimbursement Request was filed on September 7, 2023  endless emails without a respond. The first reply was a rejection of my request because I have no provided the flight number, weird thing because the flight number and other information were mandatory or necessary to let me continue and create a complaint number. Until today November 28th, 2023 I have not received the reimbursement.

### "Being rude is their motto"
The airport staff in Medellin have no respect for customers and treat all like cattle. Even when purchased their highest priced "go extra" with priority check in and priority boarding. Still cattle service. Any airline staff would even say " happy birthday" when they see your passport or offer a free chocolate on the house. Not Wingo. It's all about being nickled and dimed. Their row 1 is the worst seat you can choose at the highest price. Don't even talk about excess baggage. Their defence is the website. Being rude is their "motto".

### "Totally disappointed with their service"
On July 20 we had our flight coming back to Aruba from Bogota with Wingo. The flight had been delayed, flight was scheduled to leave Bogota at 16:21 PM but was rescheduled to leave at 18:20 pm. We were there from 2:00 pm went through immigration and we were just waiting for our delayed flight to be announced. We went to our gate at 17:40 pm since there was no announcement made to be informed that the doors are closed and we cannot board, we were informed that they do not call names of passengers but the seat number (to me ridiculous) and did not let us board while we were waiting and on time, on top on the boarding pass it is clear printed that doors will be closed 15 minutes before the hour stipulated of the flight. We had to go back through immigration and were escorted and never directed, where to go to get our luggage and we needed to figure that out, spoke to the supervisor that did nothing to help us, not even to reimburse or help us on Wingo next flight to Aruba and we paid premium price both ways, meaning we were stuck at the airport and we had to pay a one way ticket to Aruba with Avianca for $445. Totally disappointed with their service and on top we were way on time and they were the once with delay and to leave us behind as well, this is not fair at all.

### "pay $88 for my hand luggage"
Not Verified |  Firstly I had done the online check in before arriving at the airport, but was made to do it again at the desk, what is the point of that? Then I was made to buy an onward ticket from Colombia even though I plan to travel by land like I did last time and I explained this to them but they disregarded it. Then I had to pay $88 for my hand luggage just because it was a little bit taller than the small rack they had to measure it, even though it was under the weight limit (10kg) for hand luggage. That is more than the price of the original ticket! Every other airline has let my fly with the same backpack as hand luggage at no extra cost, so why should I be charged extra.

### "lied so many times"
Not Verified | They failed to pay me back or give a credit for the flight they cancelled. They lied so many times and I had to write to them 100 times and they took my bank details and failed to make payment. Lies and Lies. Recently they refused me to get a flight for the ticket they did not give me with the money they own. Guys if you get paid and do not provide service this is fraud.

### "airline is by far one of the worst"
After flying sometimes as often as twice a week on all airlines across the globe for the last twenty years, I can conclude this airline is by far one of the worst. To make matters worse, they manage to confuse me with repeated and different random requests that seems to serve no purpose except to upset their guests. Other passengers on the same flight were equally confused and shocked. Just fly Avianca to expect normal service levels, I’ve paid the same amount if not less for much better service.

### "Never fly with them"
Never fly with them. Paid for my ticket online including a checked bagagge. When I arrive at the airport I need to wait until it's my turn at the desk. I am already checked in and just need bagagge drop off. By the time I am being helped, i am told that they can't take my bag as luggage anymore, as it closed 5 min ago. I need to take my back pack in the plane, which I am charged 70 euro for or I cannot board! Outrageous! They make their problem and inadequecy mine. Complete rude staff. On top, while I walk outside to the plane,I see indiviudual bags being carried to the luggage area of the plane. Customer support total joke. I fail a complaint with their contact form, and the only response is: we don't do refunds, we closed your case.

### "Never fly with them"
Never fly with them! The check in process is slow, the boarding is a repetition of the check in (they ask the same documents two times) the food un the plane is horrible. The seat with more space have the same space of the standard seat.

### "the worst airline I ever took"
It is the worst airline I ever took. They want to make money out of everything and they will find a reason to pull some extra money out of your pocket, trust me. They check even small bags of woman for size. We payed additional 50 Euro for counter check-in service. Go for LATAM instead!

### "You will regret it"
Not even bad service, the service with this airline has been non-existent. They lost my bag from Bogotá to Cancun and have not provided any assistance, any updates, I need to pester them constantly to have basic contact with them. Additionally, all their contact numbers are purposefully made complicated to talk to a real assistant with automated voice prompts which are not helpful. They’re a scam and the worst airline I’ve been on. Still waiting for my baggage and I have told them it’s quite urgent as it has my contact lenses in them and I’m therefore effectively blind and they don’t give a hoot. I asked about compensation and they said they’re not sure if they’ll provide any. Criminal how this company is allowed to exist. Every “update” email I get from them is just a repeat of the message I sent them. Absolutely useless. Additionally, when I got off at Cancun airport, no one was able to help as “no Wingo employees” were here so it was like “tough luck - go off on your merry way now”. This airline is so incompetent and it’s a waste of money so to everyone considering using Wingo, don't. You will regret it. Save your money and avoid this company at all costs which can’t even provide basic customer service.

### "lousy scam or incompetent staff"
Airline offers cheap flights, but then gets additional income at the airport. We had to prove our departure at the check-in counter and showed the reservation confirmation for the sailing tour to Colombia. The provider was rejected by them and we were immediately recommended to simply buy a bus ticket for a bus that we will not take. I strongly assume that not only Tica Bus will benefit from the income. Otherwise, I wouldn't know why an airport employee who is supposed to document entry and exit recommends a fake bus ticket. Isn't it the employee's job to document the length of stay and the exact date of departure? So lousy scam or incompetent staff?

### "Worst airline you can pick"
Worst airline you can pick, they will overcharge everything, bad service, very slow. Just one of those airlines to always avoid. Choose anything but this, do yourself this favor.

### "cancel my flight with no reason"
Not Verified |  The worst experience you can have if you are traveling, please don´t do it. Its not worth it. They cancel my flight with no reason and they even charge you for printing your boarding pass at the airport.

### "crew to give me troubles"
When i did the check in, the girl told me i cant do the boarding if I dont have a return ticket for Bogota (where i went). I said, i went a lot of times in Bogota and they never asked me for that. She didn't care and told me if i don't buy a return ticket, she wont let me do the check in. I had no choice to buy a ticket and set up my bank account in negative. Of course in Bogota they didn't ask me to show any return ticket (the date of my departure of Bogota i mean). Thanks a lot at this amazing crew to give me troubles.

### "would not refund or reschedule me"
Terrible. First and last flight with them. They had airplane maintenance issues which caused my first leg to be 3.5 hours late. Which cause me to miss my 2nd flight with them! And they would not schedule me on the next flight which was 2 days later. They said I had to buy a new ticket. So they caused me to miss the 2nd flight and would not refund or reschedule me.

### "Their customer service is terrible"
Not Verified |  Their customer service is terrible and website barely functions. They have a chat bot that does literally nothing (attached screenshot) and was not able to make any changes to my flight because the website is broken (screenshot also attached). When calling the support number it rings for 5 minutes then just hangs up on me. How am I supposed to administer or make changes to my flight? Absolutely useless.

### "customer service is completely non existent"
Not Verified |  Do not fly this airline unless you absolutely have to. On a positive note, the plane was fairly comfortable. If you have a problem with your flight, you will not be able to resolve it and you will just lose money and be angry like I am. There are a million problems with the website and customer service is completely non existent at this company. Try calling their US number before you decide if fly if you're an American citizen, it just hangs up on me right away. The Wingo desk at Bogota airport is also very poorly trained and unfamiliar with many rules. As you know, there are always small issue that arise when flying, and it's too risky to fly Wingo.

### "stay away from this airline"
Venezuelans, stay away from this airline. We bought tickets from Wingo to travel from Cancun to Caracas. For this destination the airline scheduled a long layover in Bogota. A few days before our flight, Wingo cancelled the Bogota-Caracas portion saying the airline was prevented from flying from Bogota into Venezuela. According to Wingo, this was a force majeure case. This is in no way a force majeure case. When the airline sold me the tickets they knew they were not allowed to flight from Bogota to Caracas while other direct flights from Mexico to Caracas were allowed. The airline tried everything to keep our money and escape liability. It wanted us to take the Cancun-Bogota fligh (because that one was not cancelled), leave us there and reimburse only the Bogota-Caracas portion. When we asked for a full refund to buy the tickets from another airline and be able to go to our destination, they refused saying that they were not responsible for us not being able to enter the country. We are Venezuelan citizens and at that time we were not prevented from entering into Venezuela neither due to the Covid-19 pandemic nor by any other reason. If you know that you cannot flight to a destination, you shouldn't be selling tickets to that destination with the plan to leave the passangers stranded in the layover location. The airline knew it was not going to be able to fulfill the contract as it was entered into and the customer should not be penalized for the airline's short sigh, bad planning or plain shady procedures. The airline cannot profit from its own mistakes and lack of planning. We insisted many times to get a full refund and the airline decided to close our case alleging lack of response from us. Two months later we haven't received the full reimburse nor any explanation from the airline.

### "we were not allowed to board"
My husband had a problem with his passport, and so we were not allowed to board. (He is a Venezuelan with an expired passport, and we spoke to the airline MULTIPLE times about this and we were always told it is not a problem as many Latin American countries are letting Venezuelans travel on expired passports for 2 years). Since we were not allowed to board, we wanted to cancel and get a voucher. We were told we had to call the airline to do that. So, after holding for 30 min, we were told we couldnt cancel because it was within the 3 hour window and no cancellations are permitted . (we were at 2 hr and 45 min before takeoff to be exact). I asked to speak to a supervisor and waited another 40 min and guess what! I was told the same thing. Then I wrote them, and guess what! I was told the same thing. I have reached out to them anyway possible and I either dont get a reply or they just tell me its my fault. I understand rules, but we did everything in good faith, and they wont even give us a voucher for further travel.

### "offered excellent service"
Bogota to Havana. Since the beginning of my trip planning, Wingo offered excellent service. First of all, it was very easy to book, and as a low-cost airline where you know they will search many ways to make some extra money, they were very clear all the time with what you were able to do if you didn't want to pay more than the plane ticket. Ground service offered the Cuban visa before taking off. I found this a very good quota of service. The flight day I was surprised for them to be so punctual. We started the itinerary on time, arriving at Havana's airport earlier than expected. The seats were really comfortable considering that it is a low-cost airline, comfy legroom plus good in-flight service. They offer a menu with many options to eat in flight, and I consider they have really good prices, and they can get cheaper if you can pay in Colombian Peso due to the exchange tax. If you want to have more extra space in the seat you can pay $20 in-flight or COP 60.000. I recommend Wingo if you don't have a really big budget and if you don't care about having entertainment for international flights.

### "The service is terrible"
Aruba to Bogotá. 1 hour before boarding I was informed that the images I had of the yellow fever vaccination card were not enough for the Aruba authorities, who would require me the physical document. I asked them to allow me to go through migration again, since I could only do so in the company of an airline person and they told me that they would accompany me when the flight had closed. If I had counted on your collaboration I would have been able to request a copy of the card and have been able to address it in a timely manner. It makes no sense to use a low-cost airline to miss the flight. The service is terrible. 1 hora antes de abordar me informaron que las imágenes que tenía del carné de vacunación contra la fiebre amarilla no era suficientes para las autoridades de Aruba, quienes me exigirían el documento físico. Les pedí que me permitieran pasar de nuevo por migración, ya que únicamente podía hacerlo en compañía de una persona de la aerolínea y me dijeron que me acompañarían cuando el vuelo hubiera cerrado. Si hubiera contado con su colaboración hubiera podido solicitar una copia del carné y haber podido abordar en el tiempo justo. No tiene sentido usar una aerolínea de bajo costo para perder el vuelo. El servicio es terrible.

### "Beware of this airline"
Not Verified | Mexico City to Bogota. Beware of this airline company! We booked with Wingo because of the cheap flight they offered. Because we know low cost airline companies usually have all kinds of methods to make you pay extra we read carefully all the info that was presented in their website while booking the flight. The night before our flight we did check in on Wingo website and again read carefully everything about the process. In the morning when we came to give our bags and we were informed that we must have a printed tickets (wasn't mentioned no where) and a print screen shot in the phone is not acceptable. Apparently they are the only company that a phone screen shot of the tickets does'nt work in the check point to the security. We had to pay Wingo just for a simple print of paper 600 Mexican peso which is about 30 euro. So rude! Of course, there was nowhere in the airport a place with a printing machine so we had to pay this rip-off. Besides us, there was another couple who had the same story. After arriving in Colombia we went to their customer service in the airport to complain, we demanded to see where was it written that we need to print the tickets, the girls who worked there couldn't find this as well and told us to send an official complaint to the company website. We did, the company refused to compensate us with out a reasonable explanation. Bottom line I think this is just a way to rip people of, very disappointed. Won't recommend this airline company.

### "está sola y ya sin medicamento"
Cali to Panama. Que un representante sea un total patan y grosero, aunque haya agentes decentes, deja caer mal a todo el equipo. Mi mamá, una señora de la tercera edad e hipertensa, fue humillada y maltratada por un agente en Cali. Hasta uno de los de migración, le pidieron respeto a la Sra. Desde el inicio no respondió ni los buenos días, le pidió un dinero en efectivo y dice que le faltan $100 para poder viajar y no la dejo ni hablar y la corrió de inmediato, dijo: siguiente retírese no viaja así y punto? Increíble, ahora mi mamá tiene la tensión alta con los nervios acelerados, no la dejaron viajar, no sabe que hacer, está sola y ya sin medicamento.

### "This is a poor airline"
Medellin to Panama with Wingo. This is a poor airline. Although most airlines and especially budget airlines will charge small fees to get more money out of you, this airline has it perfected. They charged us $25 dollars at the counter to print our boarding pass! I have never heard of that before. I take over 60 flights a year. You don't want to sit on the back half of the airplane? More money. You actually want to check a bag? More money. You don't want to go crazy long line takes forever?. More money. Snack? More money Exit row? More money. Actually, it was the charging $25 to print the boarding pass while counter agent laughed about it that really hurt. I was surprised there was not a coin slot on the toilet on the plane. Uh-oh, maybe they will read this and do that.

### "said the door was closed"
Panama to Cartagena. They let me pay a fee because I didn't check in online but they didn't let me board. The airport is very small just one gate, so I was waiting in front of the gate and when I wanted to board half an hour before my flight was, they told me I couldn't board anymore. They said the door from the plane was closed. I saw the door was still open and I saw people waiting in the hall way after the gate and walking to the plane. They said they will grab my luggage out. I asked them why they can't just let me through. They weren't helpful and they never took me seriously. Because of that I couldn't take my flight and lost my money. Of course I send many emails to them but I never received anything back.

### "Wingo is a good option"
Caracas to Bogota. A simple flight without surprises, comfortable seats, although they are not reclining, good attention, on the flight the only complementary beverage is water, cheap tickets prices, the plane clean and simple. Wingo is a good option for a short trip. The Boeing 737-700 makes the flight pleasant
