### "cancels flights frequently"
Not Verified |  It cancels flights frequently this is my 6th time when Alliance Air has cancelled their flight from Rupsi to Kolkata for no reason. First time it was 7th Jan than 14th Jan than 6th March than 18th March 2025 and even 14th Jan money was not refunded till now.

### "not heard anything about refund"
We had a flight booked with them Jan 17th 2025 from Mumbai to Keshod (17th Jan 2025). They Cancelled the flight after we arrived at the airport. No reason Given. We also Had a return trip on 20 Jan 2025. Since we cannot go were we wanted to be now we cancelled both the flights. The attendent at the airport said we will get our fares refunded. It is now 4th Feb 2025. We have not heard anything about refund. Nor have we seen refund on our credit card. Airline is a scam.

### “improve the quality of their airplanes”
The flight panels seemed like they might open up any moment. One can hear all those loose screws throughout the journey. I would suggest them to improve the quality of their airplanes a bit.

### "unreliable and unaccountable airline"
Not Verified |  Terrible experience. This airline is the most undependable, unreliable and unaccountable airline. You never know if the flight will remain operational or will be cancelled at the last moment. In short, don't opt for this airline unless you don't have a choice.

### "happily fly with them again"
Excellent flight, left on time and arrived on time (Amritsar to Kullu). Small aircraft which was about 2/3 full. Great price - no complaints from me and would happily fly with them again.

### "unexpectedly cancelled the flight"
Not Verified | The airline unexpectedly cancelled the flight without any prior information. This not only caused inconvenience but further financial loss as we had to cancel our trip to Shimla last minute. However, the money that was already paid for hotel booking by then had become non-refundable. Will never recommend this airline to anyone. If they cannot ensure reliable operations, this shows there lack of professionalism and quality. It is really not worth it to waste your precious time and planning in order to save a few hundered rupees on their tickets. It seems more like a scam than anything.

### "bad history of cancelling"
Not Verified |   This flight has some bad history of cancelling. Our flight got cancelled at last movement. Our relatives had to book another at high cost from Bangalore to Vijayawada. I booked for 19 Apr 24 marriage; as it was cheaper based on checking the history that it might not repeat again as it was only once cancelled in last month. But had a nightmare; i was in call with family till takeoff hoping we are good. Soon about 15 minutes of takeoff Captain announce technical problem in midair and will be returning back to Bangalore. Also asked to hold your children. But luckily we landed safely. The coordinator said will arrange the flight at 10.30 am. When we asked again; said its same flight upon repair; then in 30 mins; again another information that the flight is not suitable and hence cancelling for the day. So the same flight is repaired and lifted every day. If there was such problem in this old ATR700 aricraft they should have grounded it.

### "disaster from start to finish"
I had the misfortune of booking my mother's first-ever flight journey with this airline, and it was an absolute disaster from start to finish. Despite her excitement and anticipation, the flight ended up being cancelled after an excruciatingly long wait. The sheer disappointment and frustration she experienced cannot be overstated. The complete lack of organization and communication from the airline only added insult to injury. I wouldn't wish this dreadful experience on my worst enemy, let alone someone I care about. Absolutely appalling service.

### "the worst flight ever"
It was the worst flight ever I used in my 17 years of air travel. No proper maintenance and no backup plan. In fact no proper information. Right after the flight took off from Benguluru, we noticed a free fall for few seconds. Then the Pilot took u turn and was able to land back in Benguluru. After land only pilot communicated all passenger that the engine #2 is not working. The communication from the airline is very bad, there were just mentioning they dont know what is going to happen no answer/decisions made and we had sit in the aircraft for an hour, and put on a bus for an hour then unloaded at airport. After that they said no backup flight, no alternate plan. They did mention we will get refund but we need to call their customer service for the refund.

### "cancelled just like that"
Not Verified | Worst airline ever. Our round trip flights got cancelled just like that - they don't care to explain the reason. We are traveling with an infant and we faced lot of problems with refund. Our trip cost a lot more because of this.

### "They have zero coordination"
They first mention the flight as delayed after reaching airport and waiting for one hour so i left to my house taking a confirmation that they will inform me about the next flight and then send a text saying flight will leave at 12:50. Called customer care to confirm and two of their representatives confirm that the flight will leave at 12:50 pm. I reach airport at 11:50 AM and entry staff tell me flight is cancelled and i receive a message from the airline at 12 pm. They have zero coordination and who informs customers about flight cancellation 50 minutes before departure? I had to travel to and fro from airport 6 times today.

### "delays of more than 3 hours"
Not Verified | Pathetic Service by Alliance Air. Please guys never book a flight with this airline - call center and onground intimations are absolutely pathetic. Flight delays of more than 3 hours.

### "Toilets with no water"
Not Verified | Travel on this airline only if you have nothing else to do or unlimited time. Always delayed. No information regarding arrival/departure. Cabin crew-employed to chat with one another and other staff members travelling on the plane. Toilets with no water.

### “This was a very bad flight”
Not Verified | This is the first time that I have traveled on such a poor flight. I will never travel on this flight again. As the flight begins, the first news comes that the engine has broken down and all passengers are evacuated. Exactly 20 minutes later, news comes that the engine has been repaired. Again the passengers are told that the flight is not starting due to engine failure. This was a very bad flight, will never travel on it.

### "No authority was available"
Not Verified |  I travelled from Agatti to Kochi. Mine and 5 other check in baggage was not carried to Kochi due to some safety issue without informing any of the passenger. On arrival at kochi the station manger informed we have to take luggage next day from the Airport on our on expense. She was not capable manage such situations and simply blaming the Alliance Air management. No authority was available for escalation of customer complaint.

### “Better to travel by train”
Not Verified | Extremely poorly managed operations, the plane was boarded and then deboarded after 15 mins because the aircraft was not charged since there was no electricity. The pilot initially reported that it would take 5 mins to get electricity and then after 10 mins reported it will take another 30 mins or may be more, the staff was absolutely unapologetic about the inconvenience and we needed to go through the security check again after the bus dropped us to the terminal, not to mention the horrible attitude of the security staff at the airport. Better to travel by train than to take this flight.

### “No cleanliness”
Washroom was stinking, too bad. No handwash was there, even washroom dustbin was full. Seats were broken. No cleanliness. Flight was delayed by 1.5 hour without prior information.

### “Worst service I have ever seen”
Worst service I have ever seen in airline industry. Alliance Air open their check in counters very late and cancelling the flights at the very last moment. My flight was at 12.20 and they didn't even confirm the cancellation till 10.45. First they said one hour delay and then they are still confused. There are no alternative flights and refund is only for the flight ticket cost. It costs me an extra 15k to book an another ticket. Worst service and please don't even pick these airlines when you see the "low cost" carrier details.

### "no news for flight delay"
My flight has at 8PM departure and at 7.50 PM the boarding gates are devoid of any crew members. Passengers are waiting to see the gates to open - even there is no news announcement for flight delay. On screen it is scheduled on time.

### "Cancelling flight at last moment"
Fooling people and trying to prove that they are professional. Cancelling flight at last moment and not arranging any alternative for customer and also not reimbursing the extra cost incurred for there flight cancelled.

### "Very bad service"
Very bad service. They open their check in counters very late. So we had to wait and couldn't access the lounge also.We had to wait, depriving our sleep without check in even though we had a chance to access the lounge

### " been a nightmare of stress"
Alliance Air's consistent flight cancellations have not only shattered our travel plans but also eroded any trust we had in their service. The experience has been a nightmare of stress, financial strain, and emotional turmoil. The airline's customer service proved unhelpful and shockingly insensitive.

### "Avoid this airline"
Not Verified |  Pathetic airline. Flight got delayed by 5 hrs. There was no communication from the airline. Avoid this airline at any cost. Even the staff at check in counter was rude.

### “Pathetic service”
Pathetic service. Received a call on the day before the journey to inform that the flight was advanced by an hour. Instead of 9:30 am, it would take off at 8:30 am. Consequently we had to leave home at 5:00 am for the airport. Flight did not leave till 9:40 am and all passengers were made to wait inside the buses on the tarmac from 8:00am to 9:00am as the pilots hadn't arrived. Finally Commander Pramod Khattri and Co Pilot Kaushik Mazumdar arrived and refused to board the bus with the passengers, even though we were informed that we were waiting for the Commander to arrive and travel with us. Another 20 minute wait ensued till another bus arrived for them. Flight took off at around 9:40am. No apology or explanation was offered to the beleagured passengers. Unprofessional airline which is staffed by incompetent people.

### "Not a pleasant experience"
Not Verified |  Not a pleasant experience. First the aircraft war delayed from 8.30 to 9.30, we reached the Dabolim by 7.30, but got to know it was again delayed till 10.30, no messages, no apology or explanations. Very bad government office like attitude still. Thru have to improve leaps and bounds to catch up to other private carriers.

### "No responsibility towards customer"
Book this flight at your own peril. Booked early morning flight for entire family from Kolkata to Guwahati. Flight delayed by more than 12 hrs. Got intimation less than 8 hrs earlier. Given option of cancellation. Confirmed the option. But tickets not cancelled till morning. The customer care executive in the morning didn't take any responsibility and cancelled ticket at his own pace. No assistance given. No DGCA rules followed. No responsibility towards customer welfare.

### "The service was terrible"
Not Verified |  The service was terrible, terrible, terrible. I’ve never had such a horrible experience with a domestic airline before. I was travelling from A67XBU from Lucknow to Gorakhpur and my God. They tortured me at the check in counter. There was only one lady who was trying to help out all the others were speaking rudely and behaving as if they were allowing me a free seat on the plane. The counter manager, Brijesh, was terribly rude and kept insisting that my laptop bag was a part of cabin luggage. Never have I sat in a flight where your handbag or laptop bag is counted as your hand carry. I requested to speak with another manager who kindly helped me seeing my state.

### "I don't recommend this airline"
Not Verified |  Worst Flight chosen to travel ever. No Alliance air support staff in the airport to talk to on the flight delay, SMS on the mobile shows flight delayed by 2 hours but in airport screens there is no such update. I don't recommend this airline.

### "Worst airline ever"
Worst airline ever. It was supposed to leave at 15:30. They informed over a mail that they will be leaving at 15:00 instead, 1/2 an hour earlier. So we reached before time since we wanted to access the lounge, they didn't start the checkin till 13:00hrs. After that we were waiting for the boarding and flight got delayed by 1hr. We asked them, they said confirm it will leave at 16:00hrs. Then again it got delayed by 1hr and this time the airline staff was like we are not sure how much will be the delay or if the flight will be cancelled. We waited, they said they cannot cancel the tickets as they don't have booking counter at that particular airport. Then we had not other option, and finally they left the airport at 18:30hrs. Worst flight ever. If you don't have any other choice, don't fly, take a rail or bus or walk to your destination but don't ever book a ticket for this airline. In flight service was a joke. The staff themselves were frustrated. Only thing good about this flight was a legroom

### "Uninformed staff"
Worst service. Delays for hours, Uninformed staff, no air con in this aircraft, no refreshments onboard, on board announcements not clear. Ground staff unclear of flight status. This was the costliest flight on that day when booked weeks before.

### "flights keep getting cancelled"
Horrible experience. The flights keep getting cancelled and none of the airlines staff are ready to help. They have no alternative plains lined up for cancelled flights. The notify only just before 20min of departure.

### "Worst airline experience ever"
Not Verified |  Worst airline experience ever. Our flight returned back from runway and we were told to wait for 1 hour as there was some technical fault and after an hour we were told that the flight is cancelled and no proper information was given as to what was the technical fault! Because of this we had to reschedule our next flight paying extra money!

### "cute and awesome journey"
Very smooth take off and landing even my mother liked it for safety purpose. Plane was small in size having capacity of 44 passengers, but it was cute and awesome journey.

### "never faced this much worst service"
I'm traveling from Mumbai to vijaywada, my connecting flight is from Hyderabad, Hyderabad to Vijayawada. I never faced this much worst service by any airline, even these people not having online we check-in, no counters. Finally I'm waiting at gate the flight was 2hrs delay.

### "Horrible customer care"
I understand that there could be delays or reschedules due to various reasons and that's why you have your customer care to smooth the process in explaining this but the guy I spoke to was rude, didn't even emphasize on the situation knowing that I was furious about the delay since it was an important meeting. He blatantly tells me that I'll get a full refund. You're serious! Asked if he could do anything in getting me on another flight to which he blindly said, he can't. Horrible customer care.

### "Worst Flight to travel"
Not Verified |  Worst Flight to travel. The flight was 3 hours delay and there was no proper instructions given. The flight was also dirty. The worst flight I ever traveled and I will not suggest anyone to travel with this one

### "do not recommend Alliance Air"
Worst airline ever. This started on the 7th of June. We started from Bilaspur (PAB) to Jabalpur (JLR). Our flight was scheduled at 11:10 am but they didn't inform us that there was a delay of 2 hours. At first there was a delay of 1 hour but they kept saying "Theres a problem with the flight". So that delayed another hour of our trip. When we got on the plane, they did not stop the engine. When the plane started flying, we expected the AC's to turn on but they did not. My family was very dizzy and saying they were about to throw up. At 8 am on the 9th of June, my dad received a message saying that our flight was delayed again for 2 hours. Listening to that made me mad. Since Jabalpur Airport is larger, it has more Alliance Air flights. There was another flight scheduled for Delhi which was also delayed. The expected boarding time was 12:15 pm but we boarded at 12:40 pm. The aircraft was different, so we thought that the flight was better. But it was the opposite. This flight had too much turbulence. They did not turn on the AC's. They served water at the END of the flight. I said you should've given water in the middle of the flight. She said, "We're supposed to give water at the end of the flight. So I strongly do not recommend Alliance Air. And do not dare to even try it out.

### "Extremely bad service"
Moment before the flight took off the tyre burst and the flight took a halt. Even after the flight got cancelled, they did not arrange any accommodation or anything for the passengers and the passengers were asked to arrange their own. Extremely bad service.

### "4+ hour delay with zero information"
4+ hour delay with zero information to passengers on cause of delay. No apology, no regret, no information and complete disregard for passengers' time and comfort. Shame on this airline and its operations.

### "worst airline I have ever dealt with"
This is the worst airline I have ever dealt with. They cancelled my flight notifying me at 2am with no other reason but cancelled. I was due to fly out at 8am so had no prior warning and no support from customer service about rescheduling or any sort of help in getting me and my family to our destination. The impact of this flight cancellation meant we had missed our connecting flight to Dubai and we were unable to change connecting flight to continue on with our holiday, so we had no other alternative but to pay extra and return home. Our refund for the cancellation should be automatic, however 3 weeks on and I am still waiting. I have sent 4-5 emails chasing, I have also called their customer service (costing me £50+ just on call chargers) and still have not had a resolution. The support technical confirmed my email and request will be processed that same day, but a week later and still no resolution. There is zero care from this airline, I recommend all to avoid booking using this airline.

### "no announcement no messages"
The departure was 9:55 pm from Chennai but it was almost 40 mins delay but no announcement no messages, to the customer. Finally we boarded the tiny aircraft, served small bottle of water at the time flight boarding. We never heard the safety instructions by the cabin crew before the flight. We departed around 10:30 pm and after 1 hour of air journey we suddenly had a massive turbulence. After some time we got small announcement due to High wind/ bad weather conditions we have to wait some more time for landing. We landed safely finally in Hyderabad airport around 12:40AM.

### "Worst customer service"
Pathetic experience. Worst customer service. Rude staff. How can the aviation industry company can have such rude staff. I won't recommend to travel with alliance. Both the staff (Ground and in flight) behave so rude its not at all expected.

### "Very poor approach by the staff"
Not Verified |  Very poor approach by the staff, whether it’s from collecting the boarding pass or the cabin crew. Forget about wishing and greeting, their behavior and response is far below par and expectations. Grooming and training the staff in customer service should be the 1st priority of the airline.

### "inordinate delays, useless staff"
Most pathetic airline, totally negligent attitude, inordinate delays, useless staff and careless attitude towards customers. Not worth traveling and have no system of handling.

### "there is a problem with the website"
Not Verified |  I purchased a round-trip ticket on the 28th going up and the 29th coming back from Chennai to Hyderabad. I did my web checkin while on the alliance website. I couldn't download the web checkin receipt or get an email. I called customer service, and the woman on the phone told me right away that there is a problem with the website and I can't get the receipt via email or on my phone. I called her and voiced my displeasure, but she could not give a proper answer. Is this how the clients are handled?

### "pathetic customer service"
I had booked a flight with them for Cochin to Lakshadweep in November 2002. I had to cancel the same due to some medical emergencies. I had called them on November 17th, cancelled the ticket and I got an sms confirmation for my cancellation instantly and I was told that I have to do nothing for my refund to be processed. But I mailed them again on the email named [email protected] just to let them know. Apparently, I emailed from a different email id. I had mentioned the proper PNR and sent a reminder on 25th November. But I got no response. I was told about a refund initially and on Dec 20, I called the customer care again and I was told that the refund amount is much lesser. But whatever the case is, no amount was credited. Again, a junior executive told me that the refund will be made in another 7 to 10 days. But later, a senior executive connected on the same call tells me about another policy, that I should have sent the mail to their help desk and not refunds email mentioned on their website. And that too, it should have been sent from my registered email. They didn't respond in spite of me mentioning PNR ans simply coming up with excuses that in spite of their sms that I'll get my money back, they insisted I send an email from my registered email. And when I expressed my dissatisfaction, they offered me some petty rewards in addition to the negligible refund. Never book a ticket with them again and if you do, don't pay extra for flexi. They're simply not a credible airline. I will never travel with this airline. And I would never fly to Lakshadweep until another airline starts service there. I would not recommend anyone to travel with Alliance air. They have such pathetic customer service. And they will keep your money with them unless and until you email and keep calling them. Once you pay, it's their money. You have to beg to get it back.

### "seat configuration was comfortable"
Smaller among all domestic airline in India operating only small bodied aircraft connecting tier 2 and tier 3 cities on smaller route. We flown from Udaipur to Ahmedabad, just an hour journey. Check in was smooth and so as boarding, before time departure and arrival. Aircraft used was ATR 72/600 still seat configuration was comfortable, better than A320 or Boeing 737 operated by other domestic airlines. Other than water no meal service. Flight was not as smooth as any narrow bodied still no major problem in comfort. As long as flight tickets are reasonably priced this airline is recommended.

### "worst airline services available"
The worst airline services available till date. They ask for money on each and every step you take towards them. They made changes on their end and asked for payment. Faux changes being made two times, their executives do not want to help, they just reply with you have to make the payment whether we do it or no. Very very very disappointed. Ended up paying 38000Rs for a BOM-IKX-BOM flight. Will never travel with this airline in my entire life again.

### "Inflight service poor"
Rude ground crew, cannot even give a face mask worth 10 inr to passengers, that other airlines provide due to covid protocol. Had to buy at airport at 50 inr each,  good nexus with shops in airport lounge. Inflight service poor, seats crowded.

### "cancelled after 5 hrs of delay"
Flight was cancelled after 5 hrs of delay. Boarding was completed and all the passengers were waiting in Bus and Terminal. No Amenities Given Like Water or Washroom Facilities. Manager Came Late and There was no Alternatives done for that. Still the Refund is not Done Yet. They are not Ready to Agree the DGCA Guidelines as-well. Please do not opt this flight ever.

### "Never fly with this airline"
Never fly with this airline, booked ticket for group. Airline cancelled this route 1 month back but they didn't inform us. Now we need to book alternative airline ticket cost gone high who will bear this additional cost. Now asking for Refund approx. 80k no response from airline side. Sent more than 10 emails no reply yet.

### "They didn't provide any support"
The flight got delayed by 3 hours without giving any prior notice. They send message 2 hours before flight departure when most of them were already on the way to airport. (Boarding was one hour before and one hour mostly people are taking margin for security check, boarding pass print etc). They didn't provide any support. No one was there at counter as well as at gate also. Also, some flight operators are providing snacks , beverages if night flight and delayed by 2 hours plus. But Alliance air didn't entertain customers like that.

### "worst experience through an airline"
My first domestic flight I took in India and my first worst experience through an airline. Counters were closed before time and nobody was there to inform travelers about it. It was all empty. There was 4 5 passengers wondering about what is going on. I had connecting flight to Canada and i had to pay amount equal to my flight booking to get my luggage done. Well some how managed to check-in but everyone was shouting at us until we reached the plane. A big zero professionalism. Plane crew was good. But if some customer is spending money on flight then you gonna treat like this and if you know your passengers are there, you gonna leave them behind. It was a worst experience i ever had. will never recommend this airline to anybody.

### "unable to provide better service"
This is new airline but unable to provide better service. Their schedule time was 09.05 for take off but till 11.05 am there was no chances to take off. On their counter no. 112 they given the delay if 1.40 hrs means showing delay schedule timing 10.45 hrs. This is vary cunning strategy to avoid penalty or free meal, because if they wrote 2 hrs they had to provide free meal or refreshment. I do not suggest to fly again in that airline

### "it was worst experience ever"
Not Verified |  This was my first experience in Alliance Air and it was worst experience ever. For 45 mins route from Dehradun to Delhi, we have to wait for 1 hour for this flight on the airport. I will personally never consider Alliance Air to anyone.

### "Very good service"
Very good service. Staff was excellent. Water bottle was given. The side table, sleek design of seating, overhead cabin luggage box all was good. Few things require better maintenance. Takeoff and landing was very smooth. I had never flown in a propellor aircraft.

### "absolute harassment by Alliance Air"
I had one of my worst travel experiences with Alliance Air. I had booked 3 tickets from Vijayawada to Bangalore 2 months in advance. The total price at the time of booking was Rs. 10,910/- (including all miscellaneous charges). On the date of travel, while checking in, I was informed that I had to pay an extra amount as I had availed of the "Military discount" at the time of booking. Nowhere in the booking portal was the "military discount" even mentioned. I was asked to pay an additional amount of Rs 10,422 in order to board the flight. So in total, I paid an amount of Rs 21,332/- for an economy class flight from Vijayawada to Bangalore in spite of booking the tickets 2 months in advance. Just like me, there were 18 other co-passengers who had to go through the same ordeal. This is absolute harassment by Alliance Air. From now on, I'm never going to board this airline and will discourage anyone from choosing Alliance Air.

### "gave seats in 3 different corners of the flight"
Not Verified |  I travelled with my family - 3 people; They gave seats in 3 different corners of the flight. All those rows, single passengers were sitting. They could have clubbed single passengers together and family together. Do not have a basic system / understanding on how to do that. Poor management.

### "Very poor service"
Flight was at 6.30 pm From Bangalore to Kechi. They cancelled without intimation. Board was still showing boarding started. After 6.20 when we asked the airline staff they said it’s cancelled. More than 100 people are waiting and staff are playing with phones. Not professional. Finally they said we have 11.00 pm flight, you all go have some food. We were nearby gate suddenly all staff disappeared, we are waiting around, board still showing 11.00 flight. Without notice they are calling one by one person when we asked they are telling that flight got cancelled. 2 flights cancelled and asking us to wait for morning 9.00am flight. Very poor service.

### "overall good experience"
This route is operated by ATR 72. Though option of A320 and B737 are available with other airlines the ticket for this ATR is always cheaper than other so went with this and was a good decision. I was traveling with only cabin baggage so no interaction with check in, boarding and departed on time. Check in baggage allowance 15 kg and cabin baggage 5kg. Seats were comfortable. They don’t offer any meal/refreshments service, neither complimentary nor paid, only water is provided/available. Reached Delhi 20 min before time, overall good experience.
