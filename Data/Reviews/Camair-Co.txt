### "flight was delayed by 10 hours"
Garoua to Douala in Cameroon. Didn't really have a choice as Camair-Co is the only airline that flies this route. Scheduled for 6:15pm local, the flight was delayed by 10 hours, pax were not notified. Only came to know about this when I went to the airport - which was full of confused passengers and no staff. A sign was written on a piece of paper - this was the only notice the airline provided. No other details. No arrangements were made for the delay - no food, no water no accommodation etc. Absolutely ridiculous. The aircraft finally arrived at 3:10 am. It did not depart till 4:30am - a full 10 hours after the scheduled departure time. The reason for the delay was not notified to the passengers. We were made to board the aircraft and just sit inside, while there was a huge commotion going on in the cockpit. Apparently the pilots refused to take off as they had ended their shifts. The flight only took off after the police were called and there were physical altercations with the pilots. What a joke of an airline. The people running this airline ought to be ashamed of themselves. Will never fly them ever again. 0/10.

### "renowned for cancelling flights"
Douala to Maroua. The most unpleasant flying experience of my life. The first question you have to ask with this alrline - the national airline of Cameroon, is "will the flight actually happen"? Outwards things were not too bad. The return was another matter. The flight from Maroua to Douala was cancelled as the scheduled 737 was out of action. A 757 was scheduled for the next day, but it meant travelling to another airport three hours away by coach as the runway at Maroua is too short for a 757. The coach left Maroua at 05.00 for a flight from Garoua at around midday. On arriving at Garoua we were told the flight would now be at 16.00, maybe. The plane actually arrived around 18.00 and we took off around 19.00. There was absolute chaos on boarding, and I had to physically fight to get on the plane - a very frightening experience. After an unscheduled stop at Yaound√© for a hour we eventually arrived at Douala around 23.00. The only positive was that the Cabin crew were charming and helpful under stress. Camair-Co are renowned for cancelling flights with no explanation.
