### "Iran Air staff in Lar airport were nightmare"
Not Verified |  Unfortunately this flight was my only option (time), and I already heard almost only negative reviews from whoever I asked from regarding this airline. The staff in Dubai airport were lovely but Iran Air staff in Lar airport were nightmare. Absolutely disrespectful, just trying to make up for their loss during COVID. They had respect and sense unlike them. Save your money and dignity and do some planning ahead. They don’t care about their customers not even the least.

### Iran Air customer review
In the absence of true competition in Iran's flight industry, Iran Air is misusing its monopoly by not being accountable towards passengers most of whom don't have any other option for direct flight to Iran. Iran Air has learnt to how not to be responsive. Awful food, entertainment, and hygiene service. Not recommended to those who don't like to have a flight as if being in a dilapidated instead of a decent airbus.

### "The plane was too crowded with out any social distancing"
Not Verified |  The worst experience that I have ever had with an airline. The plane was too crowded with out any social distancing. The in-flight food was just chicken with no alternative option that vegetarians could order. Flight attendants had very poor behavior. I will certainly never fly with Iran Air again.

### "Food was amazing"
Tehran to Paris CDG with Iran Air. Their new and well maintained aircraft are being being used on this route so I had a pleasant experience with them. Food was amazing, cabin crew were very professional, and the flight was extremely smooth.

### "never fly this airline again"
Tehran to Hamburg. Iran Air is one of the worst airlines in the world. Crew behave badly to passengers and don't respect passengers, food was awful, delay for flight was eternal in this airline. I don't suggest this airline at all. After 8 hours delayed without any food, without any apology, waiting at transit is not acceptable at all. I never fly this airline again.

### "cabin was new and clean"
Flew Stockholm to Tehran with Iran Air. I had good flight with the new fleet of this airline, 20 minute delay but the cabin was new and clean with good seat distance and very tasty food. Iranian film and music and route information was provided. I recommend flying with Iran Air on international routes because of the nice cabin and good meals for the value of money.

### "A wonderful flight"
A wonderful flight from Tehran to Paris with new A330 that was very modern. Good entertainment system but only a small number of film and music choices, but a very good flight map. The aircraft was very clean. Two meals were served, first a very good breakfast and a snack later.

### "I had a pleasant experience"
I had a pleasant experience on my Teheran Mehrabad to Shiraz flight. It was a little bumpy due to weather but a delicious packed snack and drink were served for the short flight. All the crew were very friendly and are a credit to their airline. The A320 (EP-IEG) was clean with a decent seat pitch for my 6 foot frame and I was given a row of seats to myself. All in all, a very nice company who charged a very reasonable $53 for my one way ticket. I wish Iran Air the very best with each new addition to their expanding fleet and this won't be the last time I fly Iran Air.

### "seat was comfortable"
Tehran to Cologne with Iran Air. A wonderful airline with good service. The flight took 5 hours and we had 2 meals - breakfast with 2 breads and a lot of other things and lunch was chicken with saffron rice and a small salad, yogurt and a cake. Drinks were also for free. My seat had enough space and it was comfortable. A small delay of 20 minutes but that was because some passengers were late.

### "the worst experience"
I had a flight from Tehran to London on 5th May 2016 in economy class. My baggage allowance was 40 kg according to my ticket. I did not have any cabin bag. My baggage altogether was 42 kg. One of the Iran Air staff members at Tehran Airport asked me to remove the extra 2 kg from my baggage as I was only allowed the 40kg allowance. I explained that I did not have any cabin baggage, she was rude and asked me to remove this extra baggage, pay or cancel your flight. I asked for her manager who came and gave permission for my 42 kg baggage and to continue onto my flight. I always fly with Iran Air, this was the worst experience I have had.

### "seats were large"
I travelled business class of Iran Air from London and Tehran return on an A300 / A310. Servisair lounge at Heathrow was very poor, the lounge at Tehran was very good and comfortable with a reasonably good selection of food, cold and hot drinks. Although the aircraft was old, the seats were large and with ample legroom. Catering was very good and generous, with a good choice of appetisers, sides, mains and dessert. Flight attendants were kind and caring.

### "crew were jovial"
Frankfurt to Tehran, and having been in various European and North American flights I was expecting Iran Air to be poor and possibly bad service. However, the crew were jovial and very helpful. Food was delicious, and fresh. Great take off and landings of the pilots, it was smooth.

### "staff professional and very friendly"
I flew Tehran to Rasht with Iran Air in an Airbus A330. Everything was okay and the flight was on time on time. Nice and sufficient breakfast (meal box) for less than a one hour flight! Staff professional and very friendly.

### Iran Air customer review

MXP-IKA flight IR750 August 8 Airbus 600-300 return. Airbus 321-300 Flight IR739 August 20 Tehran - Rome. Both flights on time. Aircraft dated but well maintained and clean perhaps toilets should have received more attention during the flight. Seating: good leg space comfortable seats.

### Iran Air customer review
LHR-IKA-LHR on Airbus A300-600. The inbound flight is currently a bit long as planes need to land in Ljubljana for refuelling loosing 1hr on the actual travel time. The seats are very old and comfy plenty of legroom. The staff were professional and spoke very good English. My friend pre ordered a vegetarian meal and it was not a problem. The food was tasty. I asked for a second portion and got one without a problem. IranAir does not serve any alcohol but that's part of the current Iran experience I guess. Obviously given this is a rather old Aircraft they don't have personal screens but can only show films on a large screens but at least they showed a good film. I highly recommend IranAir.

### Iran Air customer review
IR 232 THR-SYZ. When we reached the national Airport at Tehran our flight was 2 hours delayed without any further information. So had 2 hours before we could check-in. Entering an older Fokker 100 we were warmly welcomed by the crew. After takeoff we got a lunch box containing a sandwich with turkey some sweets and water. Afterwards they served also other soft drinks. Staff was always very friendly. So the flight was good only the delay was not so good.

### Iran Air customer review

### Iran Air customer review
Bandar Abbas to Shiraz on a old Fokker 100. Check in staff pleasant but a little disorganized. The flight was on time the aircraft was clean my tray table was broken but not a huge issue. The meal was very generous for a 1 hour flight and staff helpful. For $25 this was value and would use them again.

### Iran Air customer review
I flew just from Tehran to Shiraz booked about an hour before scheduled departure. After checking in and going to the gate I was called over the speaker to go back to check-in where after much confusion I was then checked into a flight scheduled to leave in about 5 minutes from then. I have no idea why it was only me that was asked to do this or if I was the only passenger booked on the other flight! Anyway the new flight was delayed by about an hour with no explanation. It was a newish (for Iran anyway) A320 and a substantial snack was provided. Legroom good and staff friendly and welcoming. My bag was the first out at Shiraz. My powers of deduction tell me most airlines in Iran have a habit of cancelling underbooked flights and combining them together particularly in the current economic climate. So expect delays cancellations and full flights.

### Iran Air customer review
I usually fly London-Tehran (and domestic) flights on an A300 600. Food is to my liking and domestic flights are actually quite good - a full bottle of water in seat pockets.

### Iran Air customer review
I fly Iranair both within Iran and also on their international routes. Aircraft's are old but clean with generous leg room. Inflight service is very basic and on long flights if you can sleep you wont be missing anything. The food is good and the cabin crew are friendly. You can not rely on on-time performance so I would only fly them if I didn't have to make a connection. A very good airline for the money.

### Iran Air customer review
Kermansah-Tehran-Shiraz-Isfahan. Flights are on time and boarding well organised. Flight duration is short around 1 hr. Iran Air provides full meal service food tastes good. Friendly staff speak English. All flights with Fokker 100 aircraft which all looked well maintained.

### Iran Air customer review
HAM-IKA-HAM good service although cabin crew could be more friendly. A300-600 are very old but I felt safe. In Iran I never fly again with Iran Air. Fokker aircraft are old and shabby inside.

### Iran Air customer review
Tehran-Zahedan Economy. I am a regular traveller on this route probably flying to and from Zahedan from tehran about 12 times a year - an expert in terms of seating on these old A300 Fokker 100 and B727 aircraft. Always ask for seat by the exit door. You will otherwise experience severe cases of cramp and discomfort after each flight. The food on these flights normally comprises a cold platter two filled rolls a chocolate biscuit and an orange drink! A truly sad airline and even a sadder experience if you ever get to fly on one of these planes.

### Iran Air customer review
THR-IST-THR flights were on time. We flew an A300-600 which were comfortable. The crews were friendly served us iranian dishes with good quality but the tea was cold and tasteless.

### Iran Air customer review
Dubai to Shiraz last year. Rather than paying for a hotel for the evening we camped in the abandoned kids playground hidden behind a small house in the airport. Morning came and we were ready to leave our plane was not. We were told all sorts of nonsense 'the plane will leave tomorrow or the day after' 'the plane will leave in a few hours' 'the plane has broken down' 'there is bad weather preventing flying'. Twelve hours later we left. I spent 24 solid hours in Dubai airport. The best toilets are the oldest ones furthest away from the duty free shops they're less used so hence less filthy. Finally got on the plane and they'd crammed three flights together into a massive pre- revolution 747. I felt bad for the staff copping a lot of flak and working a 14 hour day. The flight was short and the delay mammoth but perhaps it was all worth it because we met so many people! In short fly Iran Air if you have free time wanting to meet some locals. If you're running to any sort of schedule do not fly Iran Air

### Iran Air customer review
Kuala Lumpur-Tehran-Kuala Lumpur. Aircraft was a 747SP. Check in at KUL handled by Malaysia Airlines. I requested a window seat but didn't get it (full flight). Boarding was about 30 minutes late. The seats were old and ragged. Entertainment on the main screen only (two Iranian films from the 1970s). Meal service good - two full meals provided. Great amenity kit handed out. The crew was friendly and attentive - they have pride in their airline even though it may not be the most modern. Arrival in Tehran was a little chaotic. Long queues and baggage claim. Overall it was a good experience. Paid $1100 Australian return for KUL-THR-KUL which was good value for two 7 hour flights. I would use them again - all part of the experience of going to Iran.

### Iran Air customer review
I had 4 flights in July 2008 with Iran Air. There were the worst flights I've had in my life. The first flight was London to Tehran. The airplane was so old and the washroom was a big mess. The flight attendants were so rude and I’ve seen at least 2 load arguments between passengers and the attendants. The second flight Tehran to Tabriz. The airplane stopped in the middle of runway for the last minute maintenance. They didn't let us go back to the airport and we had to stay in the airplane for half an hour without air condition in mid summer. Well these are nothing comparing the nightmare I had when I was coming back from Tehran to London. The flight had 5 hours delay; which seems normal. There were at least 50 passengers among those people including me had a connection flight to other destination. When we asked the status about our next flight; which we lost it we've been told every thing has been organized and they already reserved a seat for our destination. Even though the Pilot in the airplane made a commitment few times that every thing is ok and we don't have to worry about our next flight. It was a joke. When we arrived to London nothing was organized and Iran air office even didn't know we are coming. When we asked about our connection flight he said" Why did you come here? I already called Iran and asked them not to send them here!” After fighting about 3 hours we got the hotel to stay over night in London. I lost one day work and flew to Toronto with British Airways next day. My advice is never taking Iran Air.

### Iran Air customer review
Tehran-Isfahan-Shiraz-Tehran flight. I went on a 90s Fokker 100 from Tehran to Isfahan and to Shiraz (leased or bought from Iberia since some of the signs were in spanish) which was comfortable. The ticket only cost $30 for each leg. The service was a lot better than I expected finding bottled water in the seat pockets (luxurious compared to the 2 dollars you have to pay to get a cup of water with American Airlines) giving me a mint before the flight and serving a Snack. The seats were comfortable but I did not try the bathrooms (I heard too many stories that they did not work). They had excellent service for handicapped (my grandmother was with me). Crew is kind and attentive actually serving to the passengers request but don't interact much or show emotions. Shiraz-Tehran we took a Soviet era Tupolev 154m (which belonged to Iran Air tours) which while having the same service as mentioned above was extremely uncomfortable air conditoning broken and with all signs written in Russian - avoid Russian planes at all cost. Don't worry about your luggage since they take good care of them.

### Iran Air customer review
Copenhagen to Teheran and return with an old Boing 747-SP. I would rather to take a hike whole way next time to Teheran rather than flying with Iran Air. Cabins crew didn't care about passenger - when ringing them they never showed up. If you were lucky you could catch them when passing you.

### Iran Air customer review
Dubai/Tehran leg on an old Airbus. The flight was full with little room in the overhead bins. Airconditioning was not working while the plane was on tarmac so had to endure around 30mins of stuffy crowded cabin. Cabin crew handed out ice water upon request. Food was nice. Overall it met expectations (I was not expecting much) given the age of the plane I was just happy to be landing in one piece. Return leg on emirates was equally cramped but their food was excellent.

### Iran Air customer review

### Iran Air customer review
Amsterdam-Tehran-Amsterdam The flight from Amsterdam was on time with an Airbus 300-600. The cabin crew were friendly although they avoid smiles as much as possible. The headphone system did not work in my seat. The food was nice. The return flight has 2.5 h delay due to heavy snow but in general I was satisfied of their service considering the old plane and other facilities.

### Iran Air customer review
Karachi to Tehran Tehran to Mashhad and then Tehran to Damascus and Damascus to Tbriz trbriz to Tehran and from Tehran to Karachi. On international routes service was quite good food is hot and good quantity while the domestic routes the food is not hot nor tasty. Service at airport was good but there is a room for improvement. Cabin staff friendly helpful. Flights were usually on time the planes were old Russian on domestic routes that were so uncomfortable.

### Iran Air customer review
Check-in is efficient. Fokker aircraft are ok while the Russian Tupolev aircraft should be avoided at all cost. The snack provided was standard. The staff was generally friendly. All in all an average airline.

Heathrow to Tehran return. The plane was elderly but clean and everything worked. Cabin staff friendly and hard working throughout the flight. Food good and plentiful and drinks were brought when requested. It appeared to me that the senior cabin staff member was a woman who was professional and businesslike. All staff were approachable and I held a conversation in English with several of them. Behaviour in my section was very good although in another section there were very noisy children. No alcohol on board of course. Check in and clearance through customs and baggage collection was reasonably quick and straight forward. I had one internal flight to Shiraz which was excellent. The only entertainment on the flights to/from Heathrow was a subtitled film in Farsi so take a book or i-pod. All in all a good experience. The Iranian people were exceptionally friendly. A fascinating country well worth a visit.

LHR-THR-SYR and THR-LHR. This airline is doing the best it can with the equipment it has. Elderly (I'm assuming pre 1979) B747-200 in both directions. IR unable to acquire new Boeings due to US trade embargo. Apparently they now operate a new A330 on some routes so perhaps this old girl is on her way out. The aircraft was clean enough inside and out but unavoidably threadbare inside because of her age. Little things like my reading light switch operating that of a seat in front of me bits of plastic hanging off the arm rest and one of the loos not flushing properly tell me retirement is long overdue. However all credit to IR maintenance staff for keeping her going as long as she has on this busy route! I'd heard about IR pilots’ legendary landing skills and can confirm that these were the smoothest I've experienced in 27 years of flying. More up to date equipment used on the short connecting flight down to Shiraz: Fokker 100. Seemed well maintained. In-flight service was fine. Food simple but plentiful and seemed less processed than on some western carriers. Crew are very hard working. Unlike western crews in economy they didn't vanish behind a curtain after the meal was served but constantly responded to individual requests for drinks. Mostly male crew quite senior and with an air of quiet competence. Attentive caring but not obsequious which conformed with the approach to service I experienced generally in Iran during my stay. Perhaps it's mandated by the proprieties of public inter gender relations in Iran but I remember a female crew member asking me if I'd like 'coffee or tea'....no smile but with an air of seriousness that one might use when making a sincere inquiry about someone's health. Quite charming really! Finally I'd like to echo the sentiments of a previous user in this forum by confirming that Iran Air are a cost effective means to get to a fascinating safe friendly and civilised country.

I have flown on Iran Air for many years but our last couple of flights put me off. On one flight travelling with our little girl of 9 months there were no nappy changing facilities provided in the toilets. We asked one of the stewards and he said "Is this your first time flying with Iran Air? (ie what do you expect from us). So we had to change the soiled nappy on the floor of the aircraft not very pleasant for the other passengers I am sure! The entertainment is next to nil. Iranian movies are shown via old-style projectors and often the headphone sockets dont work. On our flight the entire left hand side did not work (no sound). On a previous flights although seated in non-smoking some passengers insisted on smoking. I raised this with the steward and he was reluctant to impose authority and ask the passengers to stop smoking. I had to get up and do it myself which is what the crew should have done. The aircraft are very old and safety comes to mind. Overall control of passengers by crew is very low. Aircraft is still on the runway after touchdown and passengers are getting their hand-luggage and standing up without much intervention by the cabin crew.

### Iran Air customer review
Iran Air has very good inflight catering - the food is good quality and you have a choice of two entrees both hot meals. However there is a fleet of old Boeings which look like they should be retired and grounded soon and at 30000 feet you really start to think about things like that. Flight attendants are very friendly attentive helpful and courteous however they are also very casual when it comes to safety. They do not enforce safety rules as rigidly as Western or European carriers do and when I alerted one of them that someone had been smoking in one of the lavatories (very dangerous - one of the many causes of cabin fires) his answer was a mere "really? and that was the end of it. Also passengers were leaving their personal belongings next to their seats where they were cluttering the aisles and one had to be careful not to trip over them and once again the crew members made no attempt to get them to stow their belongings in the overhead bins or underneath their seats. Inflight entertainment is generally a Persian movie with English subtitles and for those who do not speak or understand Farsi the small and fast-moving subtitles can cause your eye-muscles to work overtime. Another complaint I have is that the flight attendants made no attempt to remind those seated in the non-smoking section to put their cigarettes out and being an asthma sufferer I had to remind three passengers in my vicinity that they were seated in the non-smoking section. They did have the good grace of putting out their cigarettes but I did not like being in that position. That was the flight attendants' job not mine. I would like to end my comments on a positive note however. Iran Air offers you the opportunity to fly for half of what Western carriers would charge you making travel to the Middle East easy and affordable. It also offers you the opportunity to experience Persian hospitality which is as old and ancient as Persia (Iran) itself. Crew members are delightfully pleasant and accomodating. Connections between Iran Air and other carriers serving European hubs are generally good and this particularly benefits expatriate Iranians living in the United States or Canada who wish to fly back to the old country on vacation with easy connections in Europe. For business travellers destined to other points in the region Iran Air is a good choice as it services most major airports in the Gulf and Middle East as well as some in Central Asia.

CGN-HAM-THR at the end of December 2004 and back January 2005. First of all our flight was originally CGN-THR but due to one or another reason they flew to HAM first filled up the rather old but clean A310-300 with further passengers and then proceeded to THR. The result was that we arrived 6 hours delayed compared to what was previously planned. At least they called us one day before departure and told about the itinerary change. Furthermore we got a voucher of EUR 15- each for use in restaurants at CGN due to the delay. Inflight service was nice food was fine and women did not have to wear the headscarf onboard any more. Also took domestic flight at several occasions when travelling in Iran. THR-IFN IFN-SYZ KSH-THR and BND-THR (intermediate stop at IFN) on F100 B727 and A300B4 were fine on time good catering. They keep an old fleet that well-maintained and clean.

Tehran-Esfahan-Tehran on a Fokker. Iran Air are a bit dubious on the ground but the service was good in the air. There is plenty of leg room and a very relaxed approach to hand- luggage. The pilots line up for final approach at a very low altitude though which is a bit disconcerting.

Flew on Iran air earlier this week from Tehran to Beirut. The flight itself was on time and a reasonable meal was served. But what surprised me is that as soon as the plane landed and whilst still taxing to the gate people were are up getting bags out of the overhead lockers and beginning to queue at the door!. We hadn't even made it off the runway. The flight attendants didn't do or say anything. Surely this is a safety issue!

Flown the Frankfurt-THR route. In my experience I have never heard an airline flying to THR cheaper than Iran Air does and the pilots are obviously very skilled. But there are negative sides to flying Iran Air. First of all although their Aibus fleet is one of the safest in the world their other aircrafts (Boeing747(SP)727 and Russian aircraft) are one of the oldest and most dangerous - so my advice try to avoid these aircraft when flying Iran AIr. Luckily most European flights are with the Airbus fleet. I also know that the poor shape of their Boeing fleet is not caused by neglect but the fact that the Iranian government can't buy spare parts for these aircraft from the US (politics and stuff). Also inflght entertainment is almost non-existent (not even in their Business class) especially if you don't like Farsi spoken movies shown on a projector so bring a book/magazine/walkman or whatever. My advice is to fly Iran Aar if you are sure that they are using an Airbus aircraft and if you are more concerned about your budget then about stuff like inflight entertainment or alcoholic drinks.

Flown the Frankfurt-THR route. In my experience I have never heard an airline flying to THR cheaper than Iran Air does and the pilots are obviously very skilled. But there are negative sides to flying Iran Air. First of all although their Aibus fleet is one of the safest in the world their other aircrafts (Boeing747(SP)727 and Russian aircraft) are one of the oldest and most dangerous - so my advice try to avoid these aircraft when flying Iran AIr.

In my own opinion the technical state of the fleet is quite poor but there is not any solution for it since the embargo placed by US doesn't allow the Iranians to improve the technical profile of the planes. Food is standard and inexpensive. I do not remember to have more than two different servings options in all of my flights. a "Tortilla" of potatoes eggs and soft drink salad but nothing extra. Perhaps rice with chicken in the Iranian way and nothing more. But I have to emphasise and recognise that Iranians are perhaps the most friendly and "ready to do" air crew of the world! They are fantastic. And it happens in all of the flights. Always with a smile and ready to do their best!

I have used Iran Air for several Asian and Euro destinations as well as many domestic flights. It was always a B747 for international and A300/B727 for domestic flights. The flight attendants are mixture of old ladies and young guys with beard and mustache. Apart from that their service is not bad. There seems to be a clear distinction between flight attendants before and after revolution. The former are very prestigious. Food is great! There is basically no entertainment so don't wait for it. But the flights are comfortable. It is a warm environment and I like it. Airports are like train stations in Europe - if not worse. But it is better than Indian or Pakistani airports anyway! When flying with an Iran Air B747 just remember it is 25 years old! One great advantage of this airline is the cheap domestic flights but apparently that is not going to last long.

Iran Air only operates from one city of Pakistan and that is Karachi where it has flights every Wednesday. The flights are always late and it has become a routine for frequent flyers last time I travelled it was 3 hours late! The aircraft used for international routes are old Boeings or Airbus A-300s and there is almost no onboard entertainment. For domestic travels Iran Air uses the name of Iran Air Tours The aircrafts used are mostly old Russian aircraft and almost every time I travel the trip has been a jerky and turbulent one - specially the landings. Only snacks like juice pistachios and cakes are offered during domestic flights. The airports all over Iran are very simple but are neat and clean. One thing must be admitted that Iran Air is very cheap - whether travelling international or domestic routes as compared to other countries airlines. All in all I would suggest travelling Iran Air just for the sake of adventure and fun - if not for anything else.

I fly with a majority of Iranian carriers such as Mahan Air Kish Air and Asseman. Out of them Iran Air still has her prestige in being the countries national carrier. The food onboard is terrific but unfortunately all it lacks is customer service. I don't blame Iran Air for her old fleet as this is due to the sanction by America. My flight from Dubai to Tehran (A310) was one to remember as I had been onboard the same aircraft a year before but with a different livery (former Emirates).

I have flown Iranair Paris to Tehran and back. The airplane was very old (B747) but the economy class seats had more knee room than even some business classes and certainly more than BA and KLM Economy class on long haul flights. The food was also good and plentiful. The onboard entertainment was very poor - a Farsi film shown by way of an old fashioned projector.
