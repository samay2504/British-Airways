### “the worst customer experience”
Avoid flying with KM Malta unless you're fully prepared. On my way to Malta, no one checked luggage size or weight—but on the return flight, I was suddenly charged between €25 and €60 just because my bag exceeded the limit by barely a centimeter or 200 grams. This inconsistency feels like a trap. I used to think Ryanair and easyJet were strict, but KM Malta takes it to another level. The cabin crew were rude and unprofessional—when I politely asked for a few minutes to transfer money and pay the unexpected fee, they threatened to close the flight without me. To make things worse, my backpack, which easily fit under the seat on the outbound flight, was forced into the cargo hold on the return—even though I objected. Anyone who’s ever traveled knows backpacks get damaged in cargo. Unless you pay for priority boarding and meet every luggage requirement to the millimeter, prepare to be charged and mistreated. One of the worst customer experiences I’ve had.

### "bumped off the flight"
KM Malta Airlines overbooked my flight and would not allow me to fly. Apparently they feel that overbooking is a perfectly legitimate practice. They were not at all apologetic, did not supply me with the form I needed to prove that I was bumped off the flight and then claimed that I was a No Show and refused to reimburse me for the Easy Jet flight I had to take instead. Terrible service.

### "customer-unfriendly experience"
Not Verified |  After more than 50 years of flying with various airlines across the globe, I can confidently say that KMMalta Airlines has delivered the most customer-unfriendly experience I’ve ever encountered. If you think airlines have become more customer-centric in recent years, KMMalta Airlines is here to prove you wrong. My experience started with a simple need: changing the date of our return flight. Their website indicated that the change would cost €170 – an unpleasant but acceptable fee. I was ready to proceed but got a phone call that lasted five minutes. When I returned to finalize the booking, I was shocked to see the price had suddenly jumped to €280. I contacted customer service, only to encounter an outdated bot that seemed more like a relic from the past than an AI-powered assistant. After some persistence, I finally reached a human. She told me, with a straight face, that the "cheaper seats were gone because someone else booked them. Knowing this couldn't be true, I checked Skyscanner immediately. What did I find? The exact same flight was available for €74 per ticket – or €148 for both of us. Less than the €170 initially quoted and a far cry from the €280 they were now demanding. KMMalta Airlines seems to operate under the assumption that passengers are naive and uninformed. In today’s digital age, where information is at everyone’s fingertips, such practices are not just dishonest but self-destructive. Their staff clearly lack any understanding of customer-centricity – the basic principle that customers ultimately pay their salaries and keep the company alive. If KMMalta Airlines continues on this path, it’s only a matter of time before travelers choose alternatives. After all, trust and transparency are the cornerstones of any successful business – and both are sorely lacking here.

### "spend it on a better airline"
Before you travel, the airline will send you an email asking if you want to upgrade. It is not worth your time, and most importantly your money. The upgrade does not include lounge access (this is stated). Malta has no tubes from the airport to the plane. You have to go in a bus. You get "priority boarding" but you have to wait for other people in economy to board the bus to the plane, so you might go in last. The food on the airline is not worth the cost you pay. You are better off buying food from the menu. Our plane spent an hour on the tarmac. We were not served anything during that time. On arrival in Amsterdam, the "priority" luggage came out last. At least an hour after all the economy passengers had collected their luggage and left the airport. Truly, if the airline sends you an email asking if you want to upgrade by bidding, please delete immediately. Save your money and spend it on a better airline or a lovely hotel room in Malta.

### "Onboard service and food excellent"
Not Verified |  I like KM Malta airlines. Between a faulty departure screen and me not paying attention I panicked when I saw my flight status on screen said gate "closed". Ran to the gate in 3 minutes and it was indeed closed. Much to my obvious delight and surprise they still let me board and ordered a bus to take me to the aircraft where having boarded they shut the doors and we departed. No persuasion was necessary and I can't imagine any other airline being this reasonable. Onboard service and food excellent.

### "best business class product"
Superb. This is by far the best business class product within Europe. The meal was one of the best I've eaten. Cabin crew delightful. Wine servings enormous and just nothing to correct in the product. It is a shame that no other European airline comes close to this standard.

### "service is shockingly bad"
Not Verified |  I spent a fantastic week exploring Malta. Then I flew Malta airlines to Munich (KM0308 19Sept 1540) to catch a connecting flight home, and what appalling service and attitudes I received from two individuals of the cabin crew. My seat was economy class and being 2 metres tall did not fit into it. One other passenger next to me was equally tall and the passenger next to him was shorter but much larger. Immediately I realised that I did not fit in this seat I asked a stewardess (name unknown) that if a seat with more leg room was unoccupied if I could please move to it. She agreed. My two larger passengers seated themselves. Along came a steward who said the this was not good to have 3 big guys seated together (or words to that effect). He called the chap next to me and indicated for him to come so that he could be seated in an emergency exit seat. I spoke to the stewardess who had promised me a seat, and she immediately spoke to the steward, who gruffly over-rode her with not even a glance or an apology to me. Subsequently the oversized chap was also moved to the front of the craft in business, a seat with legroom. A short while later, I asked stewardess very politely if the pilot would be trying to make up time as we left 40 minutes late from Malta International Airport and I was concerned about my connecting flight. It was my previous experience that this was common practice with late flights. She said that she would ask the pilot. She went about her duties, serving meals and refreshments to business class and the pilots in the cockpit. She entered the cockpit on three occasions that I saw. Being a 2hr 30min flight the cabin staff were quickly finished their duties and were then standing around talking to each other. At no time did the stewardess come to me to answer my query. At some time later, I saw a uniformed officer (pilot?) exit the cockpit to speak to the cabin staff, at which time I left my seat to ask the pilot myself what our landing time was. One cabin staff who saw me approach the kitchen, angrily and aggressively closed the curtain on me to stop my interaction with the pilot who had entered the toilet. Since I too need the toilet I waited outside the curtain. When the pilot had re-entered the cockpit, she opened the curtain to allow me access to the toilet. Before going in, I asked her about this flight and our estimated landing time to which she promptly stated we would land at 18h10 as per the schedule. We actually landed 18:27. The air stewardess felt no shame in blatantly lying to me. The rudeness, arrogance and disdain for passengers that the two individuals above showed me I have never before experienced from cabin staff in the 35 years that I have flown internationally. The blatant contempt they show for passengers other than business class is astounding. I had heard from people that I spoke to about Malta airlines that if possible I should avoid flying this airline as the planes are old and service is shockingly bad, but with the airline partnerships prevalent at smaller destinations this was not possible. Further, looking out my window I saw what was clearly corrosion on this very old aircraft (see attached pics). I will be sharing my review far and wide as these individuals and the training they clearly don't receive from this airline might assist others in avoiding this treatment.
