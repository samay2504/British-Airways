### "I can’t fault this flight at all"
I can’t fault this flight at all. Left on time and arrived in advance. It still baffles me how people don’t understand the concept of their own seat. Crew very professional to resolve. For an hours flight you can’t go wrong with it AirAsia

### “They are good at what they do”
Just over an hours flight with Air Asia. They are good at what they do, on time and efficient. A slightly older A320 aircraft took us from Bangkok to Hat Yai. A bit bumpy before landing but other than that very uneventful.

### "Perfect and uneventful"
Perfect and uneventful flight, left in time, boarding in BKK was done professionally and efficient. Staff were polite and helpful. Enough space in overhead lockers.

### "told we only accept cash"
This was my first and last flight with this airline. I understand that a low cost airline will not provide much if anything in terms of services such as food on a flight. However about 5 hours I asked for some water and I was told that it is 40 baht which I offered to pay for with a credit card. I was told we only accept cash and give that I had none she turned around with the bottle of water and walked away.

### "Check-in staff was atrocious"
Check-in staff was atrocious. They set aside my pregnant partner and made her fill extra paperwork which wasn’t a big problem but before that, I asked her how many months pregnant she was as if she would be refused to board. It seems like more of a retaliation.

### "we got 2 separate seats"
Not Verified |  Flight was delayed 2 times and was still not on time. Passengers were informed of the reason of the delay during the flight and not before boarding. On our flight to Phuket we got 2 separate seats even though our 2 tickets were booked together. Seats next to each other were still available but we had to pay extra for that.

### "the worst experience"
I had the worst experience with AirAsia during my check-in for flight FD 661 on December 3, 2024, from Phu Quoc to Bangkok (Don Mueang). The airline staff detained my family and me at the check-in counter for over an hour, claiming that Kazakh citizens can only stay in Thailand visa-free for 15 days. This is false, as both the Kazakh consulate and the Thai government confirm a 60-day visa-free stay. Despite showing official documents proving this, AirAsia staff rudely ignored them and insisted we purchase a return ticket on the spot. Their behavior was unprofessional, dismissive, and caused significant stress. Upon arriving in Bangkok, Thai immigration confirmed that we were right and there is no requirement for a return ticket for Kazakh citizens staying visa-free for up to 60 days. It’s shocking that AirAsia relies on outdated and incorrect information, putting passengers through unnecessary stress and inconvenience. The entire experience was frustrating and humiliating, and I would never recommend this airline.

### "very rude about the extra charges"
The ground crew at Siem Reap International Airport insisted on weighing our carry-on bags and when they overweight were very rude about the extra charges. The charges are insane - $69 for 10kg. We asked to see evidence for the amount of charges and they wouldn't provide - finally they said we could look at their screen but not take a photo. When we were upset, they told us we were unreasonable and threatened to call security. The whole time the man kept just saying "too bad, I'm in charge here". No attempt to be kind or understanding - just a money grab. I get we had weight outside of the weight limit - but I have flown 6 flights with AirAsia this month and this was the first time we were checked. There is no excuse for the rudeness this man showed us.

### "pretty good for a budget airline"
It's pretty good for a budget airline. As long as you have followed pre-departure guidelines, packed properly and have your passport, valid visa and PNR number, check-in is easy – even if it takes a while for people in front of you to repack their bags as they were NOT prepared (or were taking chances with their baggage allowance). The rest of the flight was uneventful, the crew, cabin and seating were efficient –- beyond what you would expect from a budget airline.

### "no way to communicate with them"
Not Verified |  Thai AirAsia X changed aircraft from a 2 class aircraft to a 1 class all economy aircraft. They offered 3 options - to keep my Premium Flatbed tickets but fly economy and still pay Premium Flatbed, a refund in credit or a refund to the original payment method. I chose option 3 and was told it would take 30 days for a refund. It's not been over 60 days and you can't get hold of anyone in customer service. Be Very careful, they literally have no way to communicate with them. just try this before you book. you can't get past the bot.

### "My carry on was double the weight"
I am not used to having an airline putting a weight limit to the carry on. So my mistake for not checking their carry on policy. My carry on was double the weight limit of their limit which is 7KG. And my luggage was already 3kg over the limit of one the bag which is 20kg. So when I asked, if I can purchase another bag or weight section or even asked if I can upgrade my ticket to handle my weight overage, answer was no, you can’t. Only option is pay for the excessive rate at the rate of $23 USD per KG. Yes, per KG. When I told them, I had the option to buy additional 20kg when I was checking in online the night before but I didn’t because I didn’t know about the carry on weight limit. They said that option only last up to 4hrs prior the departure time. Essentially they are betting on extorting you at the airport before you fly. Worst part is, there was no other airline that offer a flight to Phuket from Siem Reap. So, they know you are cornered in and you have no choice but to pay 6x more than what you would have paid to purchase additional 20kg online the night before. More than half the cabin space was empty in the flight as many were extorted by this airline in my flight. I for sure will never fly with them again. I will inform my community about them. I have never wrote anything about any other airlines before but I am writing to inform others. Stay away from the airline unless you want to be robbed!

### “lady was being so rude”
My family and I had to buy extra baggage due to the 7kg policy. We encountered a lady at Thai Air Asia whom is probably around early 20s. She was being rude to my family and kept telling us that the 7kg applies to the carry on and the personal bag. Which makes no sense as our other airline let us fly with our carry on and personal bag. She was persistent for us to pay extra of 2000 bahts for 20 kg. I’m so tired of this airline wanting extra money for 1kg over baggage. The lady was being so rude and won’t let us carry our stuff or give our passport back unless we made sure we have exactly 7kg.

### "never recommend it"
Customer service of this airline is well below the average for airlines. This airline nickels and dimes you for every thing regarding your travel. For water there is a charge. Additionally, their handling of baggage was very poor. My luggage was pushed in and had a container bust open all over my clothes. Customer service refused to do anything about the mishandling of the baggage and damaged goods. Will never fly this airline again and never recommend it.

### "not even offered a bottle of water"
Our flight was over 5 hours and we were not even offered a bottle of water. The cabin crew were impatient, and had an unfriendly and bad-mannered temperament. I left a small bag on my seat and didn’t realise until later when I was at my hotel. I tried to contact AirAsia but received no help, the next day I went back to the airport (BKK) but was again offered no help. I still haven’t found my bag. I will never ever fly with Air Asia again.

### “you got what you paid for”
Just an ordinary flight for a low-cost airline. Boarding went fine. Seating was quite narrow and reminds me of coach class of US carriers. My seat wasn't reclinable. The flight went as scheduled. Since the flight is short & that I took breakfast from my Priority Pass lounge, so I didn't take any meal on board. Just Ok for the low-cost and you got what you paid for. The return flight TPE-DMK got similar comments & rating.

### "nothing terrible nor special"
The words I'd use to convey my experience on Thai Air Asia would be that it was just okay - nothing terrible nor special. I guess the one thing that stood out was the check-in staff were very pleasant and helpful. There was a typo to my name with one character missing and the staff were able to rectify it without issue. I can imagine it going a different way where a major headache could have ensued. There were no frills onboard and I slept through the entire flight as it was a redeye flight albeit the poor seat padding. Flight arrived on time also. I'd also fly again if the price was cheap enough to entice me to fly with them again.

### "Another delayed flight"
Another delayed flight. Again made to catch buses to and from the aircraft despite airwalk ways available, maximising profits and inconveniencing passengers. Staff are perfunctory. Cannot recommend this airline.

### "scummy luggage policy"
Flew Danang to Chiang Mai on A320-200 aircraft 22 March 2024. Booking on their website easy though need focus to escape many attempts to trap buyer into uncountable add-ons constantly appearing. Check-in online waste of time as BP eventually is invalid and has to be done in airport in any case. Bought bundle add-on to allow for seating, food, a carry on, and to check in a suitcase. That granted me 2 carry-ons. However, it appeared to be a trap as they followingly wrote “must not exceed 7 kg for both”? How on earth can you go below 7 kg for 2 carry ons? Then they tried to sell me additional luggage while scaring me off with treats of heavy airport fees for excess luggage. However, you are then blocked off for purchasing additional carry-on kilos, as the ticket is already issued. You can only buy another suitcase allowance for >50 USD. The luggage policy is a scam, its purposely unclear, inconsistent and complicated creating confusion and fear among passengers; a big let-down. That’s where its character as an LCC appears. If they correct and expand carry on sizes and allowance it could almost be an attractive boutique carrier like e.g. Bangkok Airways. Because the rest of the experience from check-in, boarding, seating, prepaid food, cleanliness, service, etc. went very well. Food onboard was delivered perfectly according to preorder; it was well labelled, surprisingly tasty, and served very hot. Flight on time, despite being 100% full. Airbridges in both ends provided a seamless experience. Will recommend, despite their scummy luggage policy.

### "average for a budget airline"
Flight was average for a budget airline and we got to the destination safely. You have to pay for water and they didn't accept my card. At least business class on the flight home was a cheap upgrade with semi lie flat seats. Otherwise, economy is not recommended.

### "disregard for punctuality"
In yet another disappointing encounter with this airline, they once again displayed blatant disregard for punctuality without a hint of apology or explanation for the delay. This negligent behavior severely disrupts the schedules of countless passengers, many of whom have pressing connections, business obligations, and personal commitments. It's utterly unacceptable. Adding insult to injury, upon arrival at DMK airport, they chose to park the plane far from the terminal and subjected passengers to an inconvenient bus ride, exacerbating the already extensive delays. It's evident that their decision to cut corners was driven solely by budget concerns, demonstrating a complete disregard for customer satisfaction. This pattern of incompetence and negligence is not only infuriating but also raises serious concerns about the airline's commitment to its passengers.

### “staff was extremely rude and unhelpful”
Worst experience ever. They wanted to overcharge for our luggage even though we had paid for it. The electrical system malfunctioned so we had to wait inside the plane almost for one hour to take off. The staff was extremely rude and unhelpful. Worst airline ever!

### "pay to sit together"
My partner and I booked this flight together in one booking, checked in online. They placed us in seats apart and we had to pay to sit together. There are unfortunately not many other good options for airlines.

### "we have to be seated together"
We booked two tickets with Thai Air Asia and checked in 3 hrs before the flight and when they issued the boarding passes we were sat in different parts of the plane. My partner is nervous flying and we are a couple. I said we have to be seated together and the girl said everyone had checked in and system can't be changed unless we pay extra fee, After a lengthy argument the steward came and eventually changed our tickets to sit together.

### “A very efficient flight”
Boarding started on time and according to the rules (priority boarding first). Cabin crew young and friendly. Pre-ordered hot meal was served, other stuff available to buy, but only cash accepted. Arrival in Singapore was eventless. A very efficient flight.

### "cabin crew young and friendly"
Boarding started exactly as announced, the aircraft was clean, cabin crew young and friendly. We received pre-ordered food as part of a package that included also seat selection and 20 kg checked-in luggage. Flight was on time, arrived even few minutes earlier. A smooth flight.

### "pleasant no frills flight"
The usual efficient check in and boarding of AirAsia, pleasant no frills flight, on time and fast free boarding at Don Muang Airport in Bangkok, recommended

### "pay or leave our luggage behind"
I had the most horrific experience with AirAsia. My husband and I were allowed 15kgs each as checked in luggage. We had an additional bag which we wanted to check in. We had viewed the charges prior to booking and downloaded the pdf document from the website. As per the pdf document we would have had to pay no more than 1,100 THB for an additional checked in 25kg luggage. When we reached the counter, we were asked to pay 8,700 THB despite showing the staff their document and it seemed unfamiliar to them. (Not sure why as they are staff and should know their own policies) They insisted that we pay or leave our luggage behind. The staff were not empathetic and had a don’t care attitude. We explained the situation and that we were leaving for home the next day and did not have that amount of cash on us.

### "My seat was comfortable"
No trouble checking in when you arrive early. Boarding was quick. My seat was comfortable. No food ordered, had my own water. Deplaning was quick. OK airline.

### "web site didn't work"
Adding extra luggage and going through their web site didn't work. Then they ask you to "Speak with BO" who is a hinderance to flying. You can't leave customer feedback on their site without going through BO. Paying for extra luggage leaves credit card transactions that don't complete. By the time I tried to do this, it is too late to add additional luggage, like six hours before. There is no one to talk to. The delay has caused me to not be able to purchase additional luggage.

### "cabin crew was nice and efficient"
We flew Thai Air Asia from Kunming airport to Bangkok on October 30, 2023. The check-in and boarding was good. But the flight was delayed for almost 1 hour without announcement from ground staff. We have to wait without a chance to have some food and drink. The cabin crew was nice and efficient even though we were able to purchase new seat onboard. The food was Ok but not very tasty. Otherwise the flight was OK.

### "one baggage was a little more than 7"
I have a baby with me and we were clearly underweight. They harassed us so much even though we were underweight for hand luggage. We had 35 kilos available and we had 28kgs only. Just that one baggage was a little more than 7. We had to run, buy a box to shift something. We asked them if the box was ok and he said it was OK so we bought it for 150 baht. Then after shifting and packing, they said it's too big, despite us confirming the same. We pleaded but they asked for 1000 baht despite us being underweight. I ran and bought a smaller box for 100 baht and repacked everything. This took 40 mns and I almost missed my flight. They kept asking me to pay 1000 baht and kept trying to stop me from shifting luggage so that I pay them. It's not about money. They are not human.

### "delayed without explaining"
The flight was delayed without explaining. We found out they delayed our flight because of 3 passengers didn’t board. In US, we will take off on time without waiting for missing passengers. We ended up delayed 35 mins.

### "Very bad service"
Not Verified |  Very bad service. Queue 1.5 hours at the airport for check in and drop luggage. Staffs are not nice and very slow. The worst service we meet in Asia, and especially in Thailand.

### "made me remove my sealed alcohol bottle"
Such a terrible experience I had with Thai AirAsia on my flight from Ho Chi Minh City. They made me remove my sealed alcohol bottle from my checked in baggage which I have never heard of. If thats the case they should have informed in the booking portal with clarity.

### "Quite good for low cost airline"
We flew Thai Air Asia from Bangkok (Dommueng) to Loei last week. The check-in and boarding was smooth. The Cabin crew were nice and efficient. The seat was quite smaller compared to other domestic airline but it was OK. They served set of hot meal with a bottle of water and dessert for those who ordered before flight. The flight was smooth and arrive a little earlier than schedule. Quite good for low cost airline.

### "many more ways to improve"
Smooth experience from check-in until arrival at the destination. The flight is on time and proper boarding announcements and arrangements. The is no IFE. The pre-booked meal was tasty and properly served by Cabin Crew. The seats were comfortable enough for the duration of the flight, but legroom was tight and I found it difficult to stretch my legs. Smooth take-off and landing. Kudos to the flight crew. Overall, very moderate experience with many more ways to improve.

### "a reasonable flight"
Check in, first trying on the app and then on the website, and the process of paying for seats together were very clunky, but processing at the airport was smooth. Boarding was a bit disorganised -- the "boarding by group number" system quickly broke down, so passengers seated at the back of the plane were choking the aisle, unable to get through. Seat space was very tight, but OK for a 1 hour flight. At DMK we were bussed efficiently to the terminal, where our luggage arrived quickly. All in all a reasonable flight considering it was short and cheap.

### "customer services automated and useless"
Worst airline to fly with!! I reserved a seat for me and my wife on same booking number with same payment and same credit card, I got a random seat one day before the flight, my wife in the front and I'm at the back, I tried to adjust it for free, all seats are taken and the airplane is full, I decided to try to pay money for seats, suddenly I discover half of the airplane is empty, and when I went to the airplane I found it actually half empty, even the random seat which was in the front, the entire row was empty. Contacted customer service through their system, chat with them but nothing was done except that this is the system. And after a while they decided to end this conversation by themselves. Delay of the airplane for 1 hour and no communication or information so we can come late little bit. Website and customer services are all automated and useless. Don’t recommend it unless you want them to scam you and take your money.

### "the violin case was over the length limit"
I travelled with my wife and two daughters. They were in seats row 20 while my wife and I were in row 19 which were in different zones for boarding. My older daughter carried one violin with her, with the case Jakob Winter size 805mm x 208mm x 138mm, weight 1.5kg. My two daughters boarded first with boarding zone 2. When I and my wife boarded with zone 3, we found our older daughter was denied boarding by a cabin crew and stood by the front door of the plane for the reason that the violin case was over the length limit and she demanded us to buy another seat for the instrument or else check it in. We informed that the violin was over 100 years old wood and could not be checked in as it will be destroyed. My daughter also told the cabin crew that she had flown in many airlines and many flights, including the outbound flight on Thai AirAsia (DMK-HDY) without any problem with this violin and the case before. Staff said the flight was full, so there would be no space in the overhead compartment to fit in the violin. We had asked her why the outbound flight (DMK-HDY) was also full but there was no problem. She then called in the ground staff to come talk to us. We had informed him the same, and showed him the violin case. He let us into the seats and we put the case on the overhead compartment without any problem as there was plenty of space. I understand that the length of the case was not under 560mm as required by the airline, however the overall size and weight were much less than a regular cabin luggage, and the fact that many people on that flight were carrying many large luggage and shopping bags onto that flight. I do not feel that we were treated the right way.

### "incredibly cheap"
Not Verified |  The flatbed advertised (and paid for) was not available on this particular aircraft. However had a row to myself. Food surprisingly good. Very good cabin service and check in. Main criticism is whilst a “tired” interior acceptable being filthy is not. 9 hours long way without in flight entertainment and no internet connectivity available. But, incredibly cheap!

### "Two hours wrestling with a website"
The flight itself is adequate. The  disaster that is Air Asia’s broken reservations and customer service system is another matter. The issue was to pay the equivalent of USD$5 in additional baggage. Two hours wrestling with a website that generates error message after error message and ‘payment doesn’t go through’ on 4 valid credit cards. Asked my travel agent to try to resolve and they confirmed it was not possible to pay the charge online. I ended up taking a taxi to the airport and back to pay this charge. AirAsia’s own personnel were embarrassed by the whole thing. If you manage to buy a ticket and not have to make any changes at all, you might be all right. Otherwise fly another airline. I certainly will from now on.

### "high service level"
DMK-DPS. Thai Air Asia has a daily direct flight between Bangkok and Bali at good time (leave at 6:15 AM and arrives at 11:30 AM) so our flight is full with tourists mostly backpackers and families, many of them has little to no traveling experience so starting from boarding was a challenge since many of them didn't know that we are boarding based on zones. On board the FAs were very polite and patient when handling these passengers and making sure they know the basic rules of flying like how to stow their luggage properly. This was a full flight so it takes time to get everything taken care of and we left around 30 minutes behind schedule, but we arrived only around 10 minutes late. Flight time is almost 4 hours so the FAs have ample time to hand out preordered food and beverages. We ordered two items each, and they all come with drinks, and the FAs were so kind to hand our orders two at a time and came back to give us our second order around 1.5 hours before we land. The FAs on this flight were also wearing their masks all the time as was with other Thai Air Asia flights, but it didn't hide the genuine courtesy and kindness in their service. This is a very good flight and we see that the high service level is similar throughout all Thai Air Asia flights regardless of their flight duration or their flight time.

### "Service quick, polite and courteous"
Chiang Mai to Bangkok. This is a domestic flight connecting to an international flight to Bali DMK-DPS, so after check-in we were directed to immigration and go to the international terminal's waiting room. We were given a sticker to wear that indicates we are transferring international passenger which had gone through immigration. When it was time to board, we were directed to a lane that lead us all the way to the domestic terminal and the domestic gate that we were supposed to board from. This is a short 55 minutes trip at around midnight, but during a short hop like this the FAs were able to give us the hot meal we ordered and clean up before the plane lands! Service was quick, polite and courteous, done by cheerful and friendly FA's, and this is how flying a Low Cost Carrier airline should be! US airlines, and not only the LCCs, have a lot to learn from this Asian budget carrier on hospitality and service from these FAs who obviously likes what they are doing, even on a short midnight flight.

### "a good commuter flight"
Short hop BKK-CNX on FD4106 on 04/28 as part of SE Asia trip with Hubby. Thai Air Asia is a LCC with base in DMK Don Mueang but they do have some flights out of BKK Suvarnabhumi. We purchased the tickets back from US and was able to snag the 1st row seats. They board by zones and boarding was quite organized. For a short 1 hour flight the FAs were doing a good job of making sure we were served the hot meal that we have preordered and clean up afterwards. All FAs are using face mask at all times for safety precautions, and this is the norm in all flights we were on in Asia. Overall this is a good commuter flight, and for a low cost carrier the quality of service is really good.

### "on time and uneventful"
Flight was on time and uneventful. Cabin crew on this flight wasn’t very friendly, which is unusual for AirAsia. The captain did not make any effort to address the pax, not one single announcement made by him, which I only experience on Air Asia.

### "space between rows is small"
Not Verified |  First time seeing that if you purchase two tickets at the same time you get two different spots not next to each other Have no idea why I should be separated with my wife on flights. The space between rows is small, seats are awful. It was my most horrible flight.

### "no AirAsia Premium Check-in Counter"
We booked our flight from Bangkok to Da Nang with a high Premium Flex surcharge. One reason was the included special check-in at an extra counter, because we didn't want to stand in a long line. However, there is no AirAsia Premium Check-in Counter at Danang Airport. A friendly employee explains to us that there has never been anything like this here. So, we got in line. AirAsia charges guests for a service with the clear knowledge, that they will not provide it.

### "unprofessional on the back-end"
I have a flight booked for in August 2023. I just got a notification that my flight has been rescheduled. The new schedule doesn’t work out for me and getting in touch with a human customer support (not a robot) is impossible. I’ve been going back and forth with them for the last 3 hours. Finally got in touch with a live agent after waiting for an hour and the case still was not resolved. Very unprofessional on the back-end.

### "seat is good with Flat bed"
We flew Thai AirAsia from Bangkok to Tokyo Narita by Premium class on February 16, 2023. The check-in is nice and smooth. The seat is good with Flat bed and have a comfortable space. The service is OK and the cabin crew provide us with pillow and blanket (it was night flight). However, the food is quite normal and not many choice to made (mostly chicken dishes) and we received1 bottle of drinking water. The flight was smooth but delayed for 30 minutes. Overall, it is OK to fly.

### "I’m very impressed"
Far superior to American budget airlines. 60 min flight. Left on time and arrived early. FAs were very pleasant and served a quick hot meal. Premium Economy is first few rows with middle west empty. Very reasonable price and again no issues. Easy to book online and modify as my dates changed. Both airports were clean and easy to navigate. I’m very impressed

### "The experience was seamless"
Surprised in a good way. The experience was seamless. Maybe I just got lucky but short line at check in, most efficient bus gate I have ever experienced, on time pushback and early arrival. Legroom was decent for a one hour flight. Flight attendants while not warm were friendly enough and ran themselves silly serving then hawking logo items. Baggage claim was painless. I would definitely give it a second try.

### " Terrible service by AirAsia"
On November 20th 2022 we had requested wheelchair assistance with AirAsia flight from KL to Bangkok (BKK) on arrival there was no assistance my wife had to climb down stairs. We had notified them that she could not negotiate stairs. I complained but no help whatsoever. So again on January 18th Flight from Bangkok (DMK) to Penang no wheelchair on arrival after 20 minutes a lift arrived & a wheelchair was provided but no assistance I had to push my wife from the aircraft to the exit negotiating 3 steep ramps to get to Airport lounge level, trying to carry 2 cabin bags also. When I complained "that I am 78 years of age this is ridiculous" Air Asia ground staff lady said "You look fit enough" Thank you for that. Air Asia have refunded the 300 baht that I had paid for the wheelchair but to my Air Asia account & they say that I cannot get this returned to my bank account. I have to use it with them we do not intend to fly Air Asia again. Return flight on January 24th same problem IN DMK no wheelchair on arrival my wife was asked if she could walk, she cannot because of the pain in her knee. Eventually a wheelchair arrived. Terrible service by AirAsia.

### "never fly AirAsia again"
Not Verified |  Awful experience on FD350. I was in the zone that gets to board the aircraft in last as my seat was towards the front. When it was my time to finally board the aircraft I, and few people in front of me and all of the ones behind me (I recall approximately 15 to 20 people), were told that there was no more space in the overhead compartments and that our carry on would have to be checked-in. That lead to our flight to be delayed by almost 1 hour. I was planning to use the transfer counter at destination since I was only travelling with a carry on which was now impossible since I had to clear immigration and get my luggage at the belt. This was brought up to the crew but they didn't care at all. The rules are clear: 7kg and a carry that are within the requested measurements yet there was people traveling with huge backpacks twice the size of a standard carry on and never were they stopped at the gate nor asked to pay for that (despite the announcements made almost every 10 minutes prior to boarding). Instead it's us who are penalized. Absolutely unacceptable! Made me realized why I always told myself to stick with Scoot and never fly AirAsia again.

### "you get what you pay for"
This is one of the busiest routes in the world, so book early, and don't think you will luck out and get an empty seat next to you. Or, like we did book an aisle seat for the wife and a window seat for yourself and hope no one will book the middle seat. We have tried it (more than once), and there is a better chance of winning the lottery. As you would expect from a budget airline everything is cramped and rushed - but you get what you pay for.

### "overcrowded and poor service"
Nothing unusual for a budget carrier, but if you can, upgrade yourself, so you can get a lounge pass for the Phuket Airport - it's probably one of the airiest and friendliest lounges in one of the happiest airports you are likely to find anywhere. The flight itself was a typical AirAsia experience - overcrowded and poor service, but you pay for what you get.

### "pleasant flight"
Pleasant AirAsia flight from Don Mueang to Udon Thani. Left on time, pleasant flight. I had a recent operation and needed some assistance, the staff went out of their way to help me, so grateful.

### "pay a bit more for an airline that actually values customer service"
Absolute disgrace of an airline when it comes to support or changes. Made a return Premium Flex booking from Bangkok to Kuala Lumpur and on the day of the flight, due to monsoon rains, Bangkok was in grid-lock. I tried everything from that stupid AVA online chat to trying to chat with a real agent, searching Google to find a support number and just couldn't get a real person at all. Finally managed to lodge a case with AVA for a refund / cancellation (minus any fees of course) but that case got closed with zero correspondence. Do yourselves a favor, pay a bit more for an airline that actually values customer service.

### "given me trouble trying to check in"
Not Verified |  Horrifying, one way to describe it. No airline has ever given me trouble trying to check in. But when they checked me in, it was like they were trying to find a reason I can't come to Korea, even with the KETA form already done and accepted. It annoyed me with the QCODE which is not necessary, you still sign a form when you arrive, it's just annoying so it's better to have one. I am so shocked they charge for everything. Want a blanket, pay for it, even though you can't keep it. It was cold on the plane. I have never been on a plane that was cold. They let someone next to not wear his mask, really amazing. They don't really care you have your feet on someone's chair when you are landing or you release your seatbelt when the flight has just landed. Positive that customers can do sort of what they want.

### "Overall recommended"
The usual efficiency of Don Muang Airport. It took me 15 minutes from arrival at airport to the gate. Flight was on time, with friendly crew. Seats are tight, which is ok for a LCC. Overall recommended!

### "Otherwise everything was okay"
We flew ThaiAirasia from Bangkok Suvanabumi to Chiangmai on July 20, 2022. The check-in was very good and smooth. However, when we arrived at the gate, the plane has yet to come and we wait for a while. The airline ground staff tried to make up for the delay by rushing the passenger to the plane. We have to stand in the long line from airport gate to PBB for over 10 minutes unnecessarily. Otherwise everything was okay.

### "Quick and easy flight"
Very nice gate staff at UTH airport, offered a better seat, due to me using crutches right now. Helpful staff on board too, much appreciated. Quick and easy flight, all great!

### "No major issues with the flight"
No major issues with the flight. Leg room is pretty tight. But you get what you pay for. Flight was full, there was no options to buy on board due to COVID restrictions, that didn’t make much difference. On time no problems.

### "the kindness of the staff was touching"
Made half a dozen flights with Thai AirAsia over a period of one month. Each time we chose their red seats some sort of Premium Economy. For a low cost airline, my wife and I were stunned by the courtesy of the staff both ground staff and crew, I can say well over the Thai national airline in business class! My wife was handicapped and the kindness of the staff with her was touching, not only on this flight but on all of them. All of the flights took off 5 or 10 minutes early so each time we arrived on the dot: 6 times in a row the very frequent flyer I am has seldom seen that. Only criticism: this airline has a very stupid rule (about unique in the world excepted the bankrupted SAA! ): you cannot use a tablet during the first and last 20 minutes which means 2/3 of the flight.

### "cancelled the flight to Surat Thani again"
Not Verified | We have booked flight to Chumpon for a big group of over 20 person since early last year but was cancelled due to Covid19 epidemic. Therefore we have to postpone flight to October 2021 but was cancelled by Air Asia only 2 weeks before flight. Then we move the flight to February 2022 but was informed again the the flight was cancelled without certain date. Desperately, we change the destination to fly to Surat Thani on February 10, 2022 and plan to drive back to Chumphon. Incredibly, Air Asia cancelled the flight to Surat Thani again without good reason.

### "very reasonable price"
Not Verified | Booked last minute Phuket-Bangkok flights. My friend and I had hand baggage only so very reasonable price. Check in and boarding really quick and efficient. Phuket domestic terminal very modern and pleasant. Cabin crew very smart and aircraft in very good condition. Don Muang airport eerily quiet. Return flight equally well organised and efficient.

### "impossible to rebook in the future"
Bangkok to Krabi. 2 days after booking, Thai AirAsia advised by sms that due to covid-19 my flights were cancelled and advised to rebook or get a credit to be used on another flight but I will have to pay the difference if the price is higher but no refund if price was lower! There is no phone number or email and we have to deal with an online robot which starts to process the rebooking and then stops and redirects you to an online agent. However, there are no online agents and the screen sits for hours/days with the message ''Welcome to Live Chat - Please wait while we connect you to an available agent, we will be with you shortly. They are obliged to refund the cancelled tickets but don't want to do that and also make it impossible to rebook in the future. I am appalled that there is no human being in place to deal with customers who have been subjected to their cancellations.

### "refused to waive rescheduling fees"
Phitsanulok to Bangkok booked for April 2020. Unsympathetic airline which refused to waive rescheduling fees during this difficult period when there are so many travel restrictions to control the COVID-19 virus. It is not possible to get through their hotline, even waiting for the online customer service officer took me 2 days. For a 3000 baht ticket, they charged me 1700 baht for rescheduling. Incredulous we are discouraged from traveling for leisure during this period of lockdown.

### "oversized and overweight carry-on"
Taipei to Chiang Mai. At Taoyuan Airport check-in  AirAsia ground crew insisted on checking in my slightly oversized and overweight carry-on, and they refused to make an exception. So I had to check in the luggage and collect luggage at the carousel in CNX. I paid the NT$1200, but the ground crew refused to issue a Government Uniform Invoice, only a receipt. Ground crew was said he was the final authority, so "did not need to know his staff ID. I have filed a complaint with AirAsia, worst ground crew in all my years of travel. board.

### "Everything is great"
Bangkok to Phnom Penh. I use the Self-check-in Counter. Everything is great I was surprised by the legroom of Thai Air Asia. The legroom is so spacious, more spacious than other Air Asia aircraft. And Thai Air Asia is the most spacious Legroom on low-cost airlines I ever tried. The cabin crew is nice. Another on-time flight.

### "was surprised by the legroom"
Siem Reap to Bangkok. The check-in counter Staff is Nice. Everything is great I was surprised by the legroom of Thai Air Asia. The legroom is so spacious, more spacious than other Air Asia aircraft. And Thai Air Asia is the most spacious Legroom on low-cost airlines I ever tried. The cabin crew is nice. Another on-time flight.

### "in the end its fine"
Bangkok to Surat Thani. The airline is fine, but they have an issue with customer service. They changed our flight schedule, and we tried to contact them to cancel our flight many times and could never reach anyone. They dont answer phone calls, its all thru their chat robot, which never connects you to a real person. Since they changed the hour of our flight, they should give us the option to cancel, they didnt. We ended up having to do a much longer trip changing our other transportation to fit this flight. I wont say I don't recommend this airline due to one incident, because its cheap, so in the end its fine. but I wanted to let people know their customer service is atrocious.

### "I ended up with three seats"
Nagoya to Bangkok on Thai Air Asia. I ended up with three seats because people moved. I did not have food. I will fly them again.

### "I have to turn off the phone"
Bangkok to Phuket. Worst airline i have traveled with. I am regular size and barely fit into seat. I do not understand the point of printing tickets at home when I then have to stand in the same queue and wait for baggage drop. Stewardess comes to me 5 times to tell me that I have to turn off the phone that flight mode is not enough. Not flying with them again.

### "pay a huge mark up"
Tokyo to Bangkok. Everything is good except when I went to check my luggage, it cost $200 usd, on the internet check in was priced $75 but they shut down the option to check in within 24 hr. It forced me to go to the check in counter and pay a huge mark up to check one luggage, and the line to check in was so long only 3 girls working and 3 just to collect.

### "We had a good experience"
Chiang Rai to Trang via Bangkok. We had a good experience with Air Asia as we were worried about the bad reviews here. Check-in went great, pre-booked luggage was also no problem. Both planes were a little late (about 30 minutes), but that was no problem. The staff seemed good English speaking as they also answered questions.

### "eliminate the recline button"
Chiang Mai to Hanoi. Over 6 foot tall, book an exit seat. Although cramped, the interior was fresh and bright, the cabin crew professional and polite, and even the lavatories were clean. If only they would eliminate the recline button on the seats. Unfortunately, there are still travelers that just don’t consider fellow passengers when it comes to leg room.

### "tried to add baggage to reservation"
Shanghai  to Bangkok. I am  appalled with Air Asia’s customer service. I tried to add baggage to my reservation when checking in online 24 hr before my flight. The website would not allow me to do so. I tried maybe 10 times before finally giving up and deciding to pay at the counter for my bags. I explained this to a counter agent and then eventually a supervisor at check in. They told me it was my fault and that the time to add bags at a cheaper price had passed. There was nothing they could do. Instead of paying $42 for my checked bag like I would have online for my 50 pound bag, I ended up paying $430 in order to board the flight! They made me and my mom check our carry ons as well in order to increase the price. We had the standard small roller suitcases as carry ons and also one small personal item to fit under the seat in front of us. They wouldn’t allow us to take our small roller bags as carry ons even though every other passenger was allowed. These baggage policies are outrageous! The total of $430 costs more than what the fare for 4 tickets would normally cost on this airline. This airline has cheap fares but where they get you is in the baggage fees by not allowing you to add checked baggage ahead of time. And then they blame it on their website. Once on the flight, we sat in the plane with everyone boarded for 30 min before departing and then another 20 min on the runway. No announcement given to explain the delay, we just sat there for 50 min without any air conditioning. This was also the loudest flight I have ever been, passengers were yelling in their conversations with each other. The flight team could have at least asked them to quiet down. We had to pay for inflight service, even  water. As we deboarded the flight, many passengers unloaded their smaller roller suitcases and also had backpacks. We were clearly singled out in having to pay for our carry on bags at check in.

### "charged $40 for 15kg"
Siem Reap to Bangkok. They wait for unassuming customers to come to the counter and hold them hostage with check in baggage fees. Online there is no reference the fee doubling when paid at counter. You can't pay online at counter. Even in the US domestic flights charge $35 for first check in. If you don't pre check online 5 hours before the flight you will be charged $40 for 15kg. Online you pay $22 for up to 20kg. I do not recommend this Thai AirAsia.

### "Very good experience"
Hat Yai to Chiang Mai. Good flight. Boarding and take off on time. Good seats. Quite nice flight attendant service. Smooth flight and landing on time. Very good experience with this airline.

### "so-called prohibited item"
Not Verified |  Bangkok to Penang. I had an issue with bringing in an so-called prohibited item at Thailand Don Muang airport to board the plane via carry on baggage. Never faced restriction for this item on any other international airports. The item is Baj used by Sikhs for their Turban. The security staff of the airport asked me to get the airline staff to come and discuss with them if they would allow or able to help me in any way to bring on the item either through check-in baggage or any other way. When approached to the Thai Air Asia staff at the departure Gate 5 for help, they rudely responded that if the security said is prohibited then we cannot do anything without even trying to talk with the security staff. Then when asked if any way to bring in the item maybe through check-in baggage then they further rudely responded that all the baggage have been stocked into the plane and told me to direct cancel the flight and there will not be any refund. The Thai Air Asia staff at the departure gate 5 were extremely rude and not helping at all.

### "flight was comfortable"
Bangkok to Chiang Mai. Overall the flight was comfortable. Departed on time. Cabin crew were as usual keeping the standards of Air Asia. Hot seat purchased was an added advantage with better leg room and privacy.

### "hot seat which was comfortable"
Cochin to Bangkok. Departed Cochin airport on time. This time I booked their hot seat which was comfortable comparing to the standard seat. The pre booked meal was ok. Will fly again with Thai AirAsia in this sector.

### "a very normal flight"
Bangkok to Cochin. Flight departed on time. It was a very normal flight. Every thing was in order though there was some nasty co passengers Nothing more or less. I love Air Asia for the very affordable rates by which you can travel plenty. Have one concern that I felt that the cabin was very hot. Might be because the flight was full but need to set little bit lower temperature in such cases.

### "very comfortable flight"
Chiang Mai to Bangkok in the afternoon, it was a very comfortable flight. Departed on time. Air Asia has the quality of its own though it is a budget airline.

### "deny access to water"
Seats I paid for were changed by the airline, and I only knew about it because I checked on the reservation. It cost 2 hours on the phone and they couldn't offer me comparable seats so I had it refunded. Then I arrived at the airport on Oct. 1, as it said on my itinerary, with connecting transport and hotels booked after my arrival. At the airport, I found out the flight had been moved to the next day and AirAsia X did not even HAVE an office at BNE for me to go to, nor any number to call to fix the problem. It cost another night's hotel in Brisbane, and all connecting transport, plus the loss of two nights paid at our destination. On the plane to Bangkok, I was told there was no place to refill my empty water bottle. On the way back, they searched bags to confiscate any water, there was no water in the gate area. I could not in good conscience ever take my kids on an AirAsia flight. I don't know how it is legal in any country to deny access to water in a waiting area that's 30 degrees for an hour.

### "seat was fairly comfortable"
Siem Reap to Bangkok Don Muang. Thai Air Asia provided a good standard of service as the best low-cost airline in the world. I choose Thai Air Asia as I am a loyal customer to the airline and the cheapest option to fly within the region. The flight departed on-time and arrived 10 minutes early! The boarding process was fast and very organised. The aircraft is fairly old but the cabin was really clean. The seat was fairly comfortable and the leg room was a good standard for low-cost airlines. The seat pocket contain magazines, safety card and air sickness bag. The crew was very friendly and motivated. I ordered a drink which was good but overpriced. The toilet on the aircraft was small but very clean. Overall, the flight was good as a low-cost airline and I would fly them again.

### "Extra hidden charge"
Siem Reap to Chiang Mai via Bangkok. Worst experience ever. Extra hidden charge for luggage. Tickets: $182. 2 pieces Luggage @ 20 Kg ea: $560. Seriously. 15 Kg limit at the counter, 20 Kg with online check-in but the system wouldn't let us check-in online. We were told to go to counter. None of these rules can be found on their website. They charged us for each leg on a single trip.

### "very rude staff"
Surat Thani to Bangkok. This flight went smooth, on time, not very narrow seats either. A few years ago, those flight with Air Asia were always delayed, often with several hours, so we stoped using them, but now they have really improved. We have had 4 legs, the last two months no delays. The ground staff at Surat Thani should have taken 'how do you get satisfied customer' lessons. When we checked in we had bought 20 kg of luggage, one bag was 14 kgs, and we thought of sending another bag, but then the total weight became 21 kilos. Instead of taking out something from one of the bags, we brought it onboard, 'plenty of space' for luggage in the cabin, not in the belly of the aircraft. When we were boarding a very rude staff, organizing the queues, by the book, not what was the most efficient way.

### "great value for money"
This trip was a choice between Thai Smile and AirAsia. Ultimately we chose AirAsia as they were significantly cheaper. I arrived at the airport pretty late as driving to the airport before sunrise proved to be a challenge, so many U turns and unlit signs. I prefer Suvarnabhumi Airport over Don Mueang as it's just one easy turn off the intercity motorway. Check in reminded me of Heathrow Terminal 2 where everybody prints out their own boarding pass and checks their own bag. AirAsia assigns a seat for you. If you're not happy with it you have to pay to change it. There was a staff member asking if anybody was leaving within the hour, and directed us to the manned check in counter. Probably the fastest check in experience I have had, after typing our names off our driving licences he handed us our boarding passes and we were off to security. I must note that these boarding passes are essentially just a receipt with a barcode on it. Boarding by bus was complicated but somehow in the confusion we left on time and touched down 10 minutes early. I had preordered a Nasi Lemak on this flight, and it was served piping hot with a complimentary bottle of water. Not very large but decent for 120 baht paid. The seat is quite small but somehow it is better than some legacy carriers, I'm looking at you Singapore Airlines! On the return flight, the kiosk check in did not work, so we went to the actual check in counters to get our boarding pass. What was really odd was that we were assigned seats 7A and 8C, yet 8B was empty which makes me wonder why the system somehow messed up our seat assignments even though we are in the same booking. On this flight, I didn't preorder anything and bought the last hot meal left, rice with chicken teriyaki. Not the most appealing option but I was hungry. They also asked if I wanted to try their Boba milk tea. It was quite unique to get that on a plane but too sweet for my taste. The captain had already started the descent when I was being served, apparently some really strong tailwinds put us 20 minutes ahead of schedule. This was a quick day trip, and we chose AirAsia seeing that we didn't need to check any luggage, both of us had a purse bag and that was it. The crew on all flights were excellent and worked tirelessly to make all passengers feel welcome onboard. The problems that need addressing: I think a mobile boarding pass would be a good idea, I could've just gone through security straight away after parking my car at the airport. The system should also ask if you prefer a window or an aisle seat, that at least saves you some trouble if you prefer the window or have to use the toilet during the flight. The biggest problem I have is the stocks of food onboard. A normal flight normally has only 10 hot meals available for purchase, the guy in the last row would have no chance of getting a hot meal. In the end, they have great value for money and since you get what you pay for, I wouldn't say they're a bad carrier especially given the price point. If you want to fly low cost in Asia, choose between AirAsia and Jetstar. Either one of those two options are very good for their price.

### "wonderful experience"
Hong Kong to Bangkok. This story is about my wonderful experience on Thai Air Asia flight FD503 on July 27th. I have been on more flights than I can remember and even more planes counting transfers. That also means many different airline companies (including once with Air Asia to Cambodia). I would estimate that I've been in 30 different airplanes. Yet, it's easy for me to say this was the best flight I've ever taken. And not just because of the special treatment I received. I've always heard Thai people are very hospitable. But I can't imagine the attention to detail I witnessed is common. I suspect I will never have another flight where my needs (unvoiced and even unknown to myself) were anticipated and met promptly in such an elegant manner. Just a few minutes after sitting down, the flight attendant Ms. Kristina offerred to change my seat to the last empty row as I struggled with my carry on bag in the cramped space of my middle seat. I accepted and I was even able to lay down and sleep in the empty seats next to me. I had been travelling a long way even before getting on the plane in Hong Kong. What I want to emphasize is that while almost all flight attendants that I've met are polite, I have never seen such keen attention to detail before. I think most people do their jobs adequately. But the details of Ms. Kristina's actions in particular display a combination of sincerity, acute observation, and dedication to her job. It was evident after my seat change as well in the way she stooped down low, listened carefully, and answered the many questions I had.

### "good if you stick to the rules"
Surat Thani to Bangkok. Overall a good experience if you know how to stick to the rules. Print your boarding pass, no mobile boarding pass, pay beforehand for your check in luggage (20K max) and respect the size and weight of carry on luggage. If you stick to these rules, things will be fine, smooth check in, boarding. flight departed and arrived on time. the crew was OK. Not overly friendly, but who cares, it's a low cost carrier!

### "what you expect from a budget airline"
Hanoi to Chiang Mai with Thai AirAsia. Easy baggage drop-off. Had a backpack which was small enough not to raise suspicion but if your hand luggage looks heavy it will be checked. Boarding started like 1 hour before the flight and the flight arrived at its destination before schedule. I have not experienced something like this for a while. The price for the flight was a bit high and the website, while very nice, has hidden fees. The rest is more or less what you expect from a budget airline, no surprises there.

### "Uneventful flight"
Bangkok to Udon Thani. Uneventful flight, I like that. Check in was very easy and pleasant at Don Mueang airport, not many passengers on plane, flight left BKK early, and arrived in Udon Thani 25 minutes prior to scheduled arrival, fantastic!

### "received Governmental snack box"
Bangkok to Phitsanulok on a business trip and allocated on a Hot Seat with breakfast pre-ordered by my host. BTW, when it comes to serving I received only a Governmental snack box but not the pre-ordered chicken curry with rice. Flight attendants seem to recognise the problem but could not answer why this happened. After waiting until other passengers finished their meals (for a very short flight) I was given the pre-ordered tray to eat as rapidly as possible. For the record, rice was still fridge cold and the curry not adequately warm.

### "didn't even offer me a drink"
I bought a premium flex seat from Hong Kong to Bangkok. The crew handed out meals, but nothing for me. They didn't even offer me a drink. When I asked, I was told that I wasn't on the list. I showed the lady my "premium flex" ticket, still nothing. At the end of the flight they offered me a meal to go. When I complained to the company online, I received an email 10 minutes later stating that the matter was resolved. They did nothing.

### "take Thai AirAsia again"
Not Verified |  I fly with Thai AirAsia to Chiang Rai from Hat Yai. Check in via online and print out the air ticket. My flight is 7:20am Thailand time and arrived by 9:40am Thailand time. That time I get cheapest rate (around RM130/person). Check in is fast! Check in around 2 hours before we fly through the sky. Upon waiting, there is free WiFi before departure and have food and beverages. No entertainment features on the plane. On the plane, the seat is narrow. Cabin crew are very friendly. They speak Thai, English, Mandarin and Bahasa Malaysia. There is no free food and beverages. When arrived, they not allowed everyone to move in the plane once landing until final stop. When leave the plane, they say like "have a good journey". I'll take Thai AirAsia again in the future.

### "No complaints whatsoever!"
Bangkok to Udon Thani. Fast check-in at Don Mueang airport in BKK, flight on time, enough space for hand luggage, friendly staff, seat ok, short flight. No complaints whatsoever!

### "neither worked for me."
Kolkata to Bangkok. We tried to check-in online via both the AirAsia website and the app but neither worked for me. At the airport staff were not willing to accept our explanation and charged us Rp 13,670 for baggage.

### "Excellent experience"
Bangkok to Siem Reap. Quick, on time and served an excellent curry meal. The flight was barely 50ish minutes, I was in conversation with a fellow passenger and surprised that I got a meal (very tasty, btw!) and that we were actually landing! Excellent experience with checking an extra bag, arrived quickly and in good order, absolutely nothing to complain about and recommended!

### "Very poor service"
At boarding time from Singapore to Bangkok, I requested a wheelchair upon arrival for my 69 year old mother who had a bad knee. When we arrived, nobody said anything about whether they would provide a wheelchair. When we arrived at the airport, we had to walk down the stairs of the plane, take the bus, walk up the stairs again in the airport (lift wasn’t working) and then a long walk to immigration. We didn’t see a wheelchair. I was even told to pay $20 but at least they didn’t ask to pay in advance. Very poor service.

### "there is miscommunication"
Nagoya to Bangkok. Mostly my review is concerned to Ground Operation Service in Nagoya Airport as my flight was cancelled due to flight cancellation. Ground operation of Thai Air Asia in Chubu Centrair Nagoya Int'l Airport could not be handling this incident properly as there is miscommunication between airline and shops at this airport for meal voucher redemption. A meal voucher has been provided for passengers. Once I got and straight away to redeem it as it was 21:30 hrs. I went to SUBWAY, they rejected this airline meal voucher and I went down to Lawson, they also rejected. Finally it was a miscommunication between airline and shops.

### "we got more than we paid for"
Krabi to Chiang Mai. we have flown with AirAsia multiple times recently and have had no issues. It is a budget airline so you can't expect anything crazy. The flight was on time, staff was nice and courteous and our bags arrived as expected Yes leg room is small, yes we had to pay for checked bags and no there was no free snack or beverage but this was all known ahead of time so it shouldn't be a surprise and for a 2 hour flight it shouldn't be an issue. Plus we only paid $250Cdn for 5 tickets. In our case we got more than we paid for.

### "cabin baggage excess"
Bangalore to Bangkok. Do not book AirAsia assuming it provides cheap fair It is a trap. They show low fare without check in baggage, and while boarding they will charge you 5k INR if cabin baggage excess by half kg or more. They keep extra people to deal with you and go any extent.

### "ground staff get a minus 5"
Bangkok to Hong Kong. Upon entering Bangkok Don Mueang Airport, I knew I was in for trouble. The crowd rivaled Times Square on New Year's Eve, but with less security and less discipline. I went to a booth marked Air Asia help, but the lone lady attending confused passengers was working on her computer and completely ignoring people at the counter. After about 10 minutes she looked up and curtly directed me to a herd at check-in area 1. After 10 minutes in that line ( which was marked "charter flights" ), a passing Air Asia employee explained that this was the wrong area and directed me to another herd at area 2. 20 minutes later, when I finally reached the counter, the check in agent informed me that my tennis racquets were potential weapons and had to be checked baggage - but first they must be wrapped somewhere "over there".That was another line that took 20 minutes and cost 300 bahts- about 10 USD. Keep in mind that I was a premium "hot seat" passenger. It was now about 15 minutes before boarding time, and we still had passport control and security to clear. A sign at the passport line estimated a 45 minute wait. My goose was cooked, BUT, after 10 minutes in that line, I discovered that there existed a much shorter courtesy line for invalids, pregnant women, and seniors. ( finally an advantage to my 72 years ). That line still took 12 minutes, and it was now boarding time with security still ahead. That actually went quickly, and I arrived at the bus-remote boarding gate at last call. The flight itself was actually quite pleasant. The attendants were efficient, the pre-ordered food was tasty, and I had all of row 1 to myself. Later, at HKG, to my great relief, my racquets and suitcase arrived apparently undamaged. Thai Air Asia isn't responsible for all the chaos at DMK, but they are understaffed, inefficient, and not customer-oriented. Also, as a Star Alliance gold elite, I am accustomed to quick and competent ground staff. I would give Thai Air Asia onboard service a 7, but the ground staff get a minus 5.

### "system separated us"
❌ Not Verified |  Trang to Bangkok. Booked 3 people on the same reservation including a child. Their system separated us even though 3 seats were available together. System said I had to pay I get seats together but wouldn't let me change. Agent at the airport was worthless. Only thing he offered was upgrading to premium and paying 400 baht each. Don't fly thus airline. NOK AIR let's you select seats for free.

### "asked me to pay extra check-in"
Phuket to Chiang Mai. I am very disappointed by this airline. First of all, when I booked my flight it was very confusing whether I have the right to bring a 35kg check-in luggage or only a 7kg carry-on luggage. So when I got to the airport they asked me to pay extra check-in luggage because my bag didn't fit the carry-on size. Then, during my trip I had to travel with this airline again so to make sure I wouldn't have to pay at the airport I checked in my luggage 2 days before. But I  wasted my time cause they couldn't find my reservation whereas I showed them the receipt from my bank and no one couldn't help me at the airport? I had to pay again at the desk. On top of that the flight were supposed to be early retimed then it happened to be late. I sent them an email and I am still waiting for an answer.

### "Airline rescheduled the flight"
Bangkok to Phuket. Airline rescheduled the flight for 1st May such that it makes the flight useless and my insurance policy unusable due to delaying it for 1 hour 30 mins - not only iI am missing my connecting flight Ii cannot claim on my insurance as the delay is less then 2 hours. Never again. Avoid at all costs

### "a nice safe flight"
I flew Thai AirAsia from Bangkok DMK to Seoul ICN and I had a nice safe flight. Thai AirAsia ground staff and the airport staff have been very kind, polite and helpful all the ground process were very smooth. The check-in process was fast without line. The Cabin Crew members provided an excellent service. Pilots kept us informed before and during the fight. boarding was fast and smooth. The aircraft cabin was clean and comfortable, the temperature was really good not too cold or too hot. I payed 49$ for an extra package during my booking process for 20 kilos extra, a meal and pre selection of the seat. Food was delicious, tasty and different options were available for sale. Duty free products are many and nice, great opportunities for shopping. Seat is comfortable and it is possible to recline back the seat, space was okay for 5 hors flight. Blankets are available for rent for 150thb The flight was on time, I will fly again Thai AirAsia.

### "Extra legroom not worth extra cost"
Krabi to Bangkok. Customer service is terrible. Meal impossible to eat, cabin crew okay. Extra legroom not worth the extra cost of US$11, minimal difference with a regular seat.

### "nothing out of the ordinary occurred"
I travelled from Pattaya to Kuala Lumpur on Thai Air Asia on 15th December 2017. I love the airport because it is small and intimate. I had an iced coffee before leaving at one of the stands outside the entrance. Great coffee. The flight was good as usual and nothing out of the ordinary occurred. I will fly Air Asia again.

### "Sometimes very late"
Bangkok to Phuket. I have flow Thai AirAsia many time over the last 4 years of living in Thailand. Check in is easy with automation. Onboard food is good value compare to others. Advertised price look cheap. Sometimes very late, this is my biggest gripe and never apologise or explain why. When you add seat cost, baggage, food may be cheaper to fly with non budget airline.

### "On time, no hassle flights"
Don Mueang to Udon return with Thai AirAsia. Had previously checked in online so only had to collect my boarding pass at the machine (no checked bags) so check in took 2 minutes, another few minutes at security, then the long walk. DMK Domestic can involve a long walk to / from the gate. Boarding was reasonably well organised by aft / forward zones. There was priority boading for those who paid extra (presumably allowing them to stow their oversized cabin bags for less than the cost of the bag being checked in). Flights were on time, both full-full. Didn't bother with a meal from the fairly disinterested cabin crew and neither did most of the passengers. Check-in in Udon was the same - a couple of minutes at the machine assisted by helpful staff. Excellent price. On time, no hassle flights. What's not to like?

### "charged me for bags"
Bangkok to Phuket. The customer service at desk was horrible and charged me for bags even though I wasn't charged before through same airline and it cost as much as a ticket 64 US dollars. The seats were tight and the airline was late. I would not recommend but if you take them plan on being late .

### "flight was worth the money"
Flight departed 20mins late, arrived 15 mins late. Staff were courteous. Proper announcements were made inflight by the crew and the pilots. Had pre-ordered Veg hyderabadi biryani which was served with water and tasted nice. Wifi was available onboard which could be purchased. Overall flight was worth the money.

### "very crammed in the seat"
Ho Chi Minh City to Bangkok. Worst airline ever. My friend and I were traveling all over SE Asia for two weeks when I first flew AirAsia, instead of taking buses and trains all over we decided it would be best to fly since the prices weren't bad at all. Several of our flights were close to an hour late, I was very crammed in the seat, and if the people in front of you want to lay their seats in your lap the seats recline far back enough to do so. The flight attendants have no problem getting uncomfortably close in an attempt to have you turn your phone totally off.

### "delays getting very bad"
I'm flying air Asia almost weekly Kuala Lumpur to Bangkok on the last flight of the day. Last few months the delays have been getting very bad. Only 30 minutes delay is considered good, I encountered however now regularly delays from 1, 2 up to 3.5 hours. Thai AirAsia is at least so kind to send an sms and email, Air Asia Malaysia let it figure it out to yourself on their flight status page (if updated) flight tracker app is your better friend however.

### "Staff service overshadowed the negatives"
After having a rather bad experience with Nok Air, I came in with extremely low expectations. However, I should've set my expectations a little higher! The Check-in Queue was very long, however the check in staff were nice and orderly. After choosing to buy hot seats at Check-in, I had to pay at the ticket counter. The staff member there was fast and extremely nice. After duty free, I found out that my plane was a special livery plane (HS-ABD). Boarding was by bus, so I was able to take pictures with the plane. Boarding was was orderly, and fast. Cabin crew greeted me and all the crew said hello. After reaching my seat I noticed it had standard legroom. Disappointing as I paid an extra 350 baht and all I got was priority boarding. After take-off I purchased a buy on board meal of Chicken Rice, Nasi Lemak and Thai-style Chicken stir fry. My chicken rice was slightly bland but was worth the money. The staff very friendly when taking requests and chatting with passengers. There were english and Thai versions of the magazine (3Sixty). The plane pushed back on time, touched down 10 minutes early, and baggage delivery was prompt. To conclude, AirAsia is a great choice, maybe I just like the extras, so I will purchase them while booking the tickets. The ticket was cheap, so worth the money. Staff service overshadowed the negatives. However, the problem with the hot seats needs to be addressed. I will fly with Air Asia again.

### "an excellent inflight service"
Chiang Mai to Singapore via Bangkok Don Mueang on Thai AirAsia. I went on a holiday to Chiang Mai, and last minute I was desperately wanting a bonus trip in Bangkok. Then I approached the check in staff and asked her can I check in only to Bangkok, and forfeit the DMK-SIN flight and I will buy new ticket for that sector. But she told me that it's not possible unless I forfeit the entire ticket and buy a new ticket to Bangkok, I cannot check in partially to Bangkok only. Because I have the fly thru service and I need to pass immigration in Chiang Mai, not Bangkok. I was told the same by the ticket counter staff. I had no choice but return to Singapore this time and plan another Bangkok trip. I was disappointed by these, but on the bright side, everyone was nice and willing to help me even though my request could not be fulfilled. Despite all these, I still think that Thai AirAsia is providing an excellent inflight service, on both flights, the cabin crew are warmly helping every passenger, especially those people in need. The cleanliness of the cabin, including the lavatory is well maintained, AirAsia is deserved to be world's best LCC, and despite the above disappointment, I would still recommend Thai AirAsia.

### "warm service from cabin crew"
Flew on FD354 from Singapore to Bangkok Don Mueang and transit to FD3427 to Chiang Mai. The airline offers the Fly-thru service which means I do not need to collect my baggage in Bangkok despite many other LCCs require connecting passengers to do so. On both flights I was amazed by the warm service from the cabin crew. The on-board refreshments are for preorder or purchase onboard, in decent prices. I would recommend Thai AirAsia for this route.

### "curious mixture of positives & negatives"
My flying experience Bangkok DMK to Singapore with Thai AirAsia was a curious mixture of positives and negatives. AirAsia uses the older Don Mueang Airport to serve Bangkok. This was convenient for me as it is located quite close to my hotel, the Rama Gardens. DMK was considerably more crowded and run-down since the last time I visited when it was Bangkok's principal airport. The check-in counters are not well identified with signs, and I had to wander for a while and ask for guidance before I found the appropriate location. The Premium Flex add-on to the low DMK-SIN base fare costs about $30 USD and gives the passenger several priorities, including a separate check-in line, preferred boarding, more comfortable seating, a choice of hot meals, and 20 Kg of luggage. Once located, the check-in process was polite and efficient. Passport and security checks went reasonably quickly, but the terminal's air conditioning system didn't seem up to the challenge of the Thai sun and the teeming crowds. The boarding areas had more windows, but with the great views of the active runways came even more heat. The boarding process went smoothly. I had chosen one of the “Hot Seats” - the window seat in the forward, over-wing exit row. Except for these rows, which were empty, the flight was completely full. I don't know if this is a common feature of A320's, but the actual windows in these rows were so clouded with condensation moisture that they were essentially opaque. Another disappointment associated with these exit-row seats was that passengers in these seats are not allowed to purchase and consume the wine and beer that is sold on-board. The hot meal I had pre-ordered was actually quite tasty, but it would have been considerably improved with a Singha beer or two. Our departure and arrival were punctual, the crew were efficient and courteous, and the flight was smooth and uneventful. Despite the fact that my suitcase had been tagged for priority handling, it was the absolute last bag to appear on the luggage carousel, several minutes after the “last bag” sign had appeared. Given the opportunity, I would certainly fly with Thai AirAsia again, particularly now that I know the pitfalls to avoid.

### "only 15 minutes between flights"
I booked Bangkok Don Mueang to Luang Prabang (Nov 2, 2016), but I was flying to Bangkok three hours before my flight with AirAsia. 6 days before the flight I receive and email from AirAsia, that it was rescheduled, so I won't be able to get on this flight, because instead of three hours I will have only 15 minutes between my flights. They provided only two options: I can take any other flight on the same route within 7 days of my original flight. Or I can receive a refund with AirAsia credit (not cash), which I can use only within 90 days. So my options are to spend a night at the airport (or pay for a hotel in the city from my pocket), or get useless credits, which I cannot use, because I will be leaving the country. Live Chat is alway unavailable, I tried it before and had the same results. E-form answers are always by template, no one really cares to read your messages, they only provide some default answer depending on keywords in your message. And when I tried to contact them by phone, after third attempt someone finally picked up the phone, I listened for intro messages for couple minutes and then the guy on the phone told me exactly the same, what was described in the email. Superb support service!

### "food fresh, cabin staff professional"
Even though AirAsia is not my favorite airline (because it is always more expensive than Lion Air and Thai Smile) I had no other choice to fly from Utapao to Chiang Mai. Hot seat was nice with enough legroom, food paid on board fresh and cabin staff very professional. I do not understand the meaning of priority boarding of hot seats if all passengers are boarding to the same bus.

### "professional crew and perfect punctuality"
Bangkok (DMK) to Yangon. Outgoing flight begin with hassle check in. I am well prepared with web check in, no luggage checked, early arrival and only need an immigration card. The queue is horrible with large crowd packed in every square inch of ground handling area, with no way to tell where the queue start. I spent 1.5 in the scrum and almost missed my flight. Once on board everything's fine. Aircraft is pretty new, professional crew and perfect punctuality. Returning flight on 8 year old A320, but seat cushion torn, dirty floor, stained and glared windows. I found my seat have broken recline button and cannot be kept in upright condition. I was reassigned a seat only to find that the one in front  also has this problem.

### "last 2 flights have not been on time"
Bangkok Don Muang to Chiang Mai, flight booking for 9:40, instead they changed my flight to 10:20, and from CNX to DMK from 15:45 again they changed to 16:45. These are not the first time. Because last year I bought 5 flights for this year with them, and so far the last 2 flights that I flew with them have not been on time as well. Being a budget airline does not mean you can ignore being on time.

### "a good flight as usual"
Flew Bangkok to Phuket with Thai AirAsia. Overall it was a good flight as usual. Flight on time, staff nice and friendly while being very professional, pilot experienced and the flight (including the touchdown) was extremely smooth. In my personal opinion although it might be a little bit more expensive to fly with Thai AirAsia than the other budget airlines (i.e. Lion Air), it's generally worth it. The usual thing as always - their seat is a bit too hard - but for a 1 hour flight it's perfectly fine.

### "very friendly and helpful"
This was my second Thai AirAsia flight this year flying from Hong Kong to Chiang Mai, the prior one being from CNX to HKT in January. I paid extra for the 'Hot Seats' and had seats in Row 1 each time. These seats have plenty of legroom and weren't that much more money. I also pre-purchased meals on a couple of the flights and pre-paid for checked baggage on my flight in January. I found the FA's on all flights to very friendly and helpful as were the ground staff. The Hot Seats get you priority boarding which is good if you have carry on. The prices for drinks on board are also very reasonable. I paid $3 for a Singha beer which is a bargain considering US airlines will charge $7 for a beer. All in all I had good experiences on all my flights with them and would not hesitate to use them again.

### "crews efficient and friendly"
I always find Thai AirAsia cabin crews to be efficient and friendly with a good service mind. The ground experience is from poor to fair. I need to use a wheelchair and there is little care given for people with mobility challenges. We were kept waiting for a wheelchair in Bangkok, staff arrived with a wheelchair that was in very poor state of repair. No wheelchair in Krabi but the distances were short enough that it was okay. The troubles at Krabi airport when there was no special desk for people who had paid for the priority service. Another passenger who was also physically challenged and I had to wait nowhere to sit until we approached the people at the desks. A wheelchair was produced and the person taking care of me was very good. When we got to the Bangkok airport after having to get on a bus that is physically challenged there was no one waiting for myself or the other passenger wheelchair. It took a significant amount of time and discussion before they came.

### "this airline is a good choice"
Khon Kaen to Bangkok Don Muang. Thai AirAsia provides good quality for the money, though there are minor points of criticism. I bought their 'premium flex package', which gave me the option to choose my seat (1C), a meal - even though the flight took only 55 minutes - plus water, 20 kg luggage, and express luggage and boarding. The flight attendants were polite, but a bit too reserved to my taste. The seat was a bit too narrow, and the meal (lasagna) too bland. Boarding was fast, with a separate check in for those with a premium package, thus hardly any waiting time. My luggage came almost as first, so they were true to their promise. For short flights as mine, I think this airline is a good choice.

### "product quality was good"
Thai AirAsia check-in was smooth and fast at Bali Airport for flight from Bali to Bangkok. Boarding gate was changed from Gate 5 To Gate 4 and boarded with garbarata (Air Bridge). My Pre-booked meals were vegetarian fried rice and green chicken curry both with Green tea pudding and green tea cup. All pre-booked meals were provided with a 100ml mineral water. The vegetarian fried rice did not have that much taste, the green chicken curry was better but still not great, however the green tea pudding was delicious. Merchandise for sale sell on board was good and the product quality was good too. Hot seat 14C price was ODR 120.000. 4 Hour flight without inflight entertainment.

### "cabin crew were polite"
Morning check-in with Thai AirAsia for flight from Bangkok Don Muang to Singapore via self check-in service was fast. Boarding was smooth but 30 minutes delayed compared to time listed on Boarding Pass. Pre-booked meals were chicken lasagne and Asian fried rice with chicken satay. Meals were tasty and recommended. Cabin Crew were polite and good. Toilet was clean. My seat number was 10A and it was not very comfortable, but this was a budget airline.

### "not doubt to fly with them again"
I was curious to fly Thai AirAsia and was pleasantly surprised. The crew we had on both flights were male with just one female crew member but all were polite and well presented. Run on the Ryanair model, but it has a far more professional feel about it. On the return to Bangkok some food had run out but alternatives offered. Would not doubt to fly with them again.

### "cabin crew unresponsive"
Bangkok to Chennai. No specific order of boarding beyond the premium seat passengers. Buses used to transport passengers from gate to plane overly packed and crowded. The time from boarding till take off (in air) was around 40 minutes when the air inside the plane was hot and steamy. Cabin crew unresponsive and refused to give complimentary water to my small daughter. Not sure about the age of the plane.

### "a few stand out points"
With the budget carriers, you tend to get what you see on the tin. That said, there are a few stand out points for Thai AirAsia. The food and beverage offerings are better quality and cheaper than average for a budget carrier. Out of Bangkok, they fly from Don Muang (I prefer that over Suvarnabhumi). Most of all, the staff appear to know what they are doing. I quite liked the clear pre-recorded arrival PA announcement. The only notable downside was they operated this flight with bus access to the apron. Don Muang is not over congested, so you would think they could find a spare gate.

### "booking website is very confusing"
Thai AirAsia booking website is very confusing and very unforgiving, I booked an international flight where the standard on most other airlines I flew would be at least 15 kilos. I was told you paid for 0 kilos going, but 40 kilos coming back. I had to double baggage fees for a minor error. I just want to warn other passengers of this as it seems Thai AirAsia deliberately make it hard for those extra fees. I would be looking at other airlines to fly with.

### Thai AirAsia customer review
Service was nearly non-existent, both on the ground and airborne. The flight attendant was seriously involved with her hair and was unavailable to assist passengers. I was aware that Thai Airasia was a low cost airline, but I was unprepared for how lacking in service the airline is.

### Thai AirAsia customer review
FD 3112 outgoing flight delayed for over 45 minutes without prior notice, only display 20 minutes delay on screen before scheduled departure time. Aircraft clean enough but looked old with wear and tear. Seat tight and not so comfortable. FD 3111 return flight boarded punctually but delayed with passenger's carry on problem, seemed as though everybody could bring on  what they wanted. Their policy is not enforced whatsoever and that is very problematic. Cabin crew are polite, efficient and try their best. Food sold on board was fairly priced. Generally a fair experience and acceptable standard.

### Thai AirAsia customer review
My first flight from Khon Kaen to was without any complaints. I had a tight connection and staff even changed my seat to the front of the plane to help me make my flight. Unfortunately once I got to DMK everything went horribly. No one could direct me to domestic transfer flights. Once I missed my flight and went to the counter of AirAsia the woman only told me that I shouldn't have booked such a short connection (even though online allowed me to) and that the next flight she could put me on was on Monday. Told I would have to pay for the new flight, I immediately went to Nok Air for a new flight. Awful service.
