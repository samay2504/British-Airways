### "horrible and chaotic"
It is horrible and chaotic even in Singapore Changi Airport. There is no online check in facility. There is no check in machine, only three counters working. The queue is super long. Refer to the photo, can you imagine it is Thai Lion Air counter in Singapore Changi Airport? Thai Lion Air is so horrible.

### “did not get my luggage when I landed”
I did not get my luggage when I landed. Got a message from the company next day saying they already had it but I had to pay 500bath to get it back to my hotel in spite of it was not my fault at all. Company policy they said.

### “they showed zero flexibility”
Our experience with Air Lion was absolutely awful. Not only did they refuse to rebook our flight after we missed it due to a delayed connection, but they also showed zero flexibility. They didn’t offer any discount or assistance—even when it came to baggage fees. The worst part? Our checked baggage (40 kg) never made it onto the flight, yet they still took full payment for it! And when we asked to book the next flight, they tried to charge us even more than our original ticket price. This airline clearly has no respect for its passengers. They take your money but don’t take responsibility. Avoid Air Lion at all costs unless you want to be treated unfairly! Fly with NOK Air or Air Asia.

### “there was no accountability”
Terrible experience with Lion Air! First, my flight from Bangkok to Phuket was delayed by an hour, causing me to miss my bus. To make things worse, they broke my luggage, and of course, there was no accountability. On the way back, they overcharged me 1,200 THB for just 0.5 kg of extra luggage on a short one-hour flight—ridiculous and a clear scam. To top it off, that flight was also delayed by 1 hour and 15 minutes. This is by far the worst airline I’ve ever used. Unreliable, overpriced, and careless. Avoid at all costs!

### "absurd cabin baggage they allow"
The flight was half an hour late taking off. What’s frustrating is the absurd cabin baggage they allow. Your meant to only have 7kg. The amount of oversized baggage that is clearly meant for a hold. Causes absolute chaos trying to fit all bags in the cabin.

### "stroller will be delivered at the gate"
The flight was okay. I was travelling with a child and a stroller for aircraft delivery. Checked at the counter for the same and was told that the stroller will be delivered at the gate. However, at Bangkok the attended outside the aircraft gate refused to give the stroller and kept instilling we go outside and check at baggage carousel. It's not a big deal and I would have done the same but when I probed her and asked her to tell me her name and show her ID she refused. She started pretending that she doesn't know English and kept insisting that we need to go outside. All she had to do was let the ground team know that a stroller was requested but she didnt want to do that. This is just unacceptable. I asked her for her name and designation multiple times but she refused. Rude arrogant and stupid.

### "Excellent safe service"
Aborted take off because of approaching storm. Excellent safe service to safe guard passengers. Fantastic airline thank you. We sat on the tarmac in the plane until clear to take off. Pilot flew around bad weather to give us smooth flight.

### "on time, crews ok"
Though a low cost airline, i feel ok to fly Bangkok to Phuket return 1 hour flight. Airport check in staff was ready in help, aircraft ok, on time, crews ok. Only thing is so called low carrier, flight ticket in compared to other must be too low cheaper.

### “Another delayed flight”
Not Verified | Another delayed flight. Pathetic approach to customer service non existent. Look at the flight records usually late. Clearly the performance management system has failed. No air bridge bused out. If you are organised checking in on line you are put at the back of the plane no seat choice. It's below budget flying without the bargain price. I choose to fly Nok Air now.

### "a very bad managed company"
First they delayed the flight, but I see that this is the norm for Thai Lion Air. I was charged 3k THB for the luggage at the counter, you'll think "why don't you take online before going to airport? - because I checked on the website under "manage your booking" and the only options was to buy an insurance, no seat selection or baggage allowance. Please avoid if not necessary, is really a very bad managed company.

### "Shameful airline company"
Not Verified | I was supposed to fly on the 10th of february 2024 in the morning, so that I can make my connection by ferry to Koh Lipe. They canceled my morning flight, put me on an afternoon flight without my consent. I will lose the money for the ferry and the first hotel night booked in Koh Lipe, will have to pay another ferry the next day and also pay for one night in Hat Yai. I called the customer servie several times, NOBODY ANSWERS. I sent multiple emails, NOBODY WROTE BACK. Oh and if I want to change myself my flight to another day, of course I have to pay at least 40 euros of change fees. Also their phone app does not work, only error messages. Shameful airline company and they put shame to Thailand!

### "tight and uncomfortable seats"
Flight delayed by an hour, no notification given to pax, no apologies or even an announcement by the cockpit made, old worn 737, friendly staff, tight and uncomfortable seats

### “this is clearly a complete money grab”
My full first name is Stuart. When my return Thai domestic flight was booked online with Thai Lion Air my name was automatically entered as Stu (the abbreviation I usually use). Ticket cot about US$80, I have travelled domestically under the name Stu many times before. However, I thought I'd better try to put it right, Thai Lion Air's 'helpful' response. 1) you cannot do this on line or by email. Must call the call centre. The cost will be about US$40 for a 'name change'. 2) On the 3rd attempt and after a 15 minute wait finally get a person at the call centre. Ahhhh..you have to pay the US$40 fee for each leg as, technically, it is two seperate bookings????? But I booked it all at the same time???? yes, but two flights, two different numbers" so have to pay double!!! I have no issue with a reasonable fee for a reasonable extra service but...this is clearly a complete money grab! Don’t fly with Thai Lion Air!

### "airline not a good deal at all"
Not Verified |  Our honeymoon trip. They charged us more money and delayed us by 5 hours. Than they delayed it another 2 hours. 7 hours total. We planned to get to Krabi afternoon and ended up getting to hotel after bus at 9 pm. So entire day was a waste of money thanks to Thai loan air. Overhead bins can accommodate normal sized bags but they have the smallest specification limited I seen on airline so they basically try to overcharge massive premiums on everyone. Makes the airline not a good deal at all. Zero water or crackers. Rough take off and landing. The biggest issue I had was the fact they wasted an entire day of our honeymoon though and charged us for it on top of it.

### "There are better low budget carriers"
Flight delayed by an hour, no communication about the delay at the airport. No announcement or apologies in the air, there was not even a single announcement by the cockpit about arrival time etc. Old and worn B738, with broken irritating flickering lights in the aisle. There are better low budget carriers flying this highly competitive route.

### "I was forced to pay B1,600 Bag fees"
Poor ground staff & ground handling. At SIN, the flight arrived late and they did not notify passengers. Mostly terrible ground and cabin crew, very few friendly and helpful ones. From 15 July 2023 Promo ticket holders do not get free checked bags (20kg) and Agoda did not inform me. I was forced to pay B1,600 at DMK Bag fees cost more than my ticket. Last minute cancellations! 10 Oct. 2023 SL 100 (DMK-SIN) was canceled today. No emails, no notification I found out on the Agoda app.

### "Refund request online did not work"
Our flight has been rescheduled from 19:10 to 9:10 am! The early plane was impossible to reach for us as we were on an island. Lion Air had cancelled 2 flights that day. Refund request online did not work and after a woman at the customer service has hung up on me. No-one picked up the phone anymore - even after being more than 30 minutes in the waiting line. So we basically lost our tickets.

### "it’s the worst out there"
Not Verified |  Terrible airline. Never ever on time and no communication about delay. Do not FLY Thai Lion Air if you want a smooth trip or you need to be in time, it’s the worst out there.

### "Bad bad service"
Very bad luggage policy. We booked our flight via internet. During booking we did not get the possibility to add luggage to our booking. This was very strange to us. We read online that there were two possibilities, either we could checkin bags with a max weight of 10 kg or we would be charged at the checkin counter with of course higher costs than when you add luggage when you book the flight. To no surprise of us but to our frustration we had to pay at the checkin! The lady at the checkin didn’t speak English and she “didn’t know” about the allowance to bring 0 kg per bag. All she did was direct us to a counter were we had to pay extra for our luggage. Bad bad service!

### "Worst airline I have flown"
Worst airline I have flown - total chaos on check in. 1 hr line to get boarding pass, told I couldn’t check luggage despite having already paid for it. Stood in another line for 30 min. Neither the system or the staff have a clue. Take any other airline

### "happily fly with Thai Lion Air again"
Domestic internal flight from Ubon Ratchathani to Don Mueang Airport in Bangkok. Couldn’t complain. The flight left on time. Cabin crew friendly enough for a low cost carrier. Would happily fly with Thai Lion Air again

### "I'll never use Thai Lion again"
Flight times were changed several times. As this is the route to Koh Phangan, the new time made it impossible to return. I had booked tickets for 8 people, on 3 separate bookings. Two months later, after sending bank accounts of both me (payee) and the travellers, power of attorney from travellers (who never even paid for the ticket) and numerous other documents, I am still waiting for two of these bookings to be refunded. I ended up paying double the cost on a rival airline due to the late notice. I'll never use Thai Lion again - the number of cancellations/rescheduling is simply too high to plan in advance.

### "Stay away from them"
Not Verified |  4 weeks before our booked flight they rescheduled 4 times. Originally 8am, then 1.30pm, 11.30pm and finally 10.30pm. I asked to cancel my booking and receive a refund. 7 weeks later nothing. Even spoke to their staff who were rude and aggressive. Never again. Stay away from them. Thai Lion Air, you should be ashamed to treat customers like this.

### "Absolutely shocking service"
Not Verified |  They just seem to change the flight times and put you on a new flight 8 hours later and tell you you have not been delayed. Same on the flight out here. Absolutely shocking service. It’s definitely not worth your money or time. Fly another airline they all are much better than Lion Air.

### "It's not worth your money and time"
I planned to go to Singapore in early February 2023 and booked a flight from Bangkok to Singapore with Thai Lion Air 3 weeks in advance. But 4 days before my trip, I received an e-mail from the airlines informing me that my flight was rescheduled from Feb 1 to Feb 2. I contacted the airlines customer service to ask for rescheduling reasons and how they could help me, but they couldn't provide me any reasons why they rescheduled my flight. They gave me 3 options for fixing my problems: rescheduling flight, keep flight credit, cancel and refund. I chose the last one because I lost my trust and wasn't confident to fly with Thai Lion Air because they couldn't explain what happened to my flight. I asked them if there was any flight a day before and after my trip and they said 'yes', but in the same time, they didn't tell me any information about my rescheduled flight. They said they wouldn't give me a full refund because rescheduling didn't affect a return ticket. I contacted them 3 times to ask for reasons, but no response. I even complained at the front desk at the airport, but I wasn't sure if they'd take any actions for improving their service. After I finished a process of refund, which I didn't receive a full refund, I contacted travel insurance agency, Muang Thai Insurance, who is the partner with Thai Lion Air. The agency told me that they couldn't let me claim my insurance because they needed the reasons why my flight was rescheduled or cancel. I said I didn't know because the airlines didn't provide me anything. So, the agency said it was my responsibility to contact the airline. I felt like I was taken advantage of by the airline and my travel plan was ruined. I had flown with Thai Lion Air before and I didn't think it was bad. The seat was comfy and the service was good back then. But I didn't know what happened to them right now. So, I won't recommend any travelers to fly with Thai Lion Air. It's not worth your money and time. This is the worst airlines I've flew with ever!

### "a pleasant flight"
Short-haul international leg from Bangkok DMK to Singapore on the single-class B737-800. Even though it's the first time writing a review for this airline, I have flown with them no less than 10 times in the past, pre-pandemic. Everything went along smoothly, from the check-in counters (<10 min wait), to the boarding process and the entire flight itself. Everyone boarded on time, took off on time and landed on time. Even though it is a budget airline, it is a nice touch when they offer 20kg of check-in luggage at no additional cost, as well as a small snack and bottle of water onboard. Legroom was above-average for a budget carrier and good enough for most passengers under 6 feet. The crew were approachable and professional, and made for a pleasant flight.

### "most stressful experience"
They cancelled our flight and the next one was more than a day later! They refused to give us any compensation or place to stay which most airlines provide in case of delays and cancellations. On call, which was very hard to get through to, they did not help at all. They said sorry but we can not do anything. Even the refund they did not want to process. It is the worst and most stressful experience with any airline so please do not trust them. They seem to do this often form other reviews which i did not know of before booking.

### "don't have any intention to refund my money"
I booked a ticket on 26th July Phuket to Bangkok. They changed flight time and mailed me. Then I want to cancel my flight and want full refund as per airline norms. But they don't have any intention to refund my money. In fact i tried to call to there call center, no one reply to me. Also tried to call Indian call center. Same reflection. Thai Lion actual a cheater Airline company. They cheated our money. I have sent many many mail to them but didn't get any satisfactory result.

### "most horrible flight in my life"
Probably one of the most horrible flight in my life. There is just nothing right with this company, from the check-in, delay handling, to security in the cabin and complaint handling. Flight was delayed over 3 hours because of supposedly bad weather conditions, while other airlines were flying just fine for the same routes. Left without ANY updates of confirmed departure time, and more importantly, we were refused the ability to cancel our tickets. We were not offered any food or drink for our over 3 hours wait in the terminal. Staff English at the counter was below acceptable, as they were barely able to understand questions in regards to how to deal with my music instrument. Staff on board failed to give instruction in English. I was addressed multiple times in THAI, which I do not speak and I wasn't even given the chance to ask what it meant. Ground staff at arrival (Lost and Found counter) don't speak English at all. Call center (called 18th March 3:20PM) excuses failure to follow laws and basic security and information requirements by "We are a low cost airline".

### "a pleasant no frills flight"
This was a pleasant no frills flight, flight was on time, friendly crew, clean aircraft. But what sets this carrier apart from other budget airlines are the 10kg checkin allowance. I can recommend this carrier.

### "2 years of waiting for refund"
They cancelled the flight last April 2020. That is 2 years of waiting for refund but I kept getting their response that it is still being investigated since there was huge volume of flights they cancelled. 2 years and still no refund up until now. Modern day thief!

### "worst refund experience"
Not Verified |  This is the worst refund experience, I ever have. They say only a credit account refund is possible, and you have to redeem within a year. My ticket was on 3 April 2020. And now the pandemic isn't over, there is no flight available from Taiwan to Thailand. However, there are no notice for any refund or extension.

### "I did not receive my money back."
I had booked the flight from DMK to TST, at first they had changed my flight and I did not want to change so I decided to cancel it for to route going to TST. Then after that the flight back from TST to DMK had been changed again so I would like to cancelled because I had limited time so it was not convenient for me. I decided to cancelled for both flight and they told us to refund the money within 45 days or it could be a bit late as now there are so many passengers asked for the refund. I understood that so I was waiting patiently until now it's been 9 months, I did not receive my money back. I sent them email and they said it has been processing but do not know when it will come. Totally disappointed. To whom wish to fly with this airline, please consider again before you purchase their ticket because if there is something happened, you will lose your money forever.

### "no intention of providing refunds"
I had a flight booked in April 2020, which was obviously cancelled. I have emailed and called many times to request some sort of update on my refund, and the response is always the same: "In regards to your email, your refund is still in process. it takes an unusually long time to process the refunds. Sorry for your inconvenience". The response never changes and never provides any clear information. I definitely understand the last year has been challenging. However, I also had reservations with two other Thai airlines - one has processed the refund, and the other is at least providing updates and regular communication. At this point, it feels like there is no intention of providing refunds. I recommend booking with any other airline.

### "no money and no more contact"
Flight of march 2020 was (logically) cancelled. We requested a refund, which the system said was being processed and could take up to 45 days. Since then no money and no more contact. Phoned multiple times, waiting time up to an hour and when finally in the call, being pressed away again.

### "still waiting for refund"
Like many others, still waiting for refund. Original flight plans was in mid-April but as they was understandably cancelled due to COVID I called them to receive a refund. Very hasty reply call center, was almost not able to finish what I wanted to say. Their waiting time has exceeded 30 min every time. Likely close to 40 minutes. Next call was in beginning of August after sending emails in between, I was told to wait until end of October. That has now passed by over a month and still no information and of course no refund.

### "never fly with them again"
Paid extra for seat advanced selection but they changed aircraft type and my seats to something different than what I picked without informing me, only realized the change after boarding the flight. Made a complaint at their ticket office at Don Muang Airport after we landed and was told supervisor would call me to discuss refund. 3 days later and still no call, have tried to contacting call-center and put on hold for 20 mins with no one answering calls. Will never fly with them again and would not recommend them.

### "they don't refund you"
Bangkok to Bali. I wait for refund more than 215 days They told me with in 45 days you have refund I call 10 time minimum. Send 40 email minimum and still no refund. So watch out when book ticket they don't refund you.

### "Terrible airlines and terrible service"
Not Verified |  I have been waiting 6+ months for a refund, and they never reply to any emails or enquires. Terrible airlines and terrible service. They have basically taken free money for a service that was never provided. This airline is nothing short of a giant scam. Never will I ever book with Thai Lion Air again, and I will warn every single traveller to avoid this airline at all costs.

### "never take a flight with them again"
Due to Covid-19, Thai Lion Air notified me the cancellation of my April round trip flight from Taipei to Bangkok but without mentioning any remedy. I had to go to their website to find out the solution. Then I sent 2 emails with photocopy of my e-ticket and passport to request a refund, but got no any response and of course no refund since April. This is the worst airline I have ever experienced, and I will never take a flight with them again.

### "really fed up and disappointed"
In February 2020 I got email to refund for my ticket Singapore to Bangkok. They said within 45 days will receive but I ‘m been waiting 4 months. In between I tried to contact several time to hotline and email as well but no response. Now I really fed up and disappointed of that they do not keep their word. I will not be customer of that airline again.

### "This is very poor service"
Singapore to Bangkok was cancelled due to Covid-19 situation, I had called to Singapore customer service hotline in last February to ask for refund but till now no respond from Thai Lion Air. Worst, the hotline was terminated in March. I've been keep sending emails to Thai Lion Air subsequently but no reply at all. This is very poor service and totally unacceptable. Will never book any Thai Lion Air flight if no refund back to me.

### "poor customer service"
I was so appalled by the poor customer service. I have never been spoken to as rudely as my a Thai Lion Air representative on the phone. I My flight from Bangkok to Bali was rescheduled twice by airline. I rang up. Waited 50mins. I understand Covid-19 led to cancellation. What I don’t accept is having to wait 60 working days for a refund. Told this is normal and I should be happy. Staff clearly don’t care. Asked to speak to manager told no! I’ve never known such arrogance and rudeness. Please stay away.

### "They did refund my money"
Not Verified |  I had a flight with my partner with Thai Lion Air from Bali to Bangkok on March 20th 2020 which cost 160 euros and we needed to get to Thailand to fly home on April 7, all this in the middle of the covid 19 crisis. Some days before I got check the flight status and it says unknown. I proceed to email Lion Air , as well as text them on Facebook and Twitter, as I didn´t have a phone to call. It is now April 8 and they have only now replied. When I got to the airport I found out that the last flight they would be operating to Thailand had been the day before, and they had given me no information. The staff was extremely rude and unhelpful to me, the customer service is terrible. They did refund my money right away in cash.

### "Worst experience flying"
Not Verified |  Bangkok to Colombo. Worst experience flying of my life. They are a complete scam. They made us wait in line at check-in for over an hour and I was at the airport 2 hours early, then, when I get to the counter the have me paid for my checked bag which I anticipated a good $70-80 but they said now I was too late SO, $177 later I checked my bag. Awful. They had no customer service representative for us to talk to (there was a group of us). I don't care how much more I have to pay, I will never fly Thai Lion again.

### "the most horrible airline"
We’ve been traveling around Thailand for nearly 2 weeks - from Chiang Mai, Bangkok, Koh Sumai, Krabi and now heading to Bali, Indonesia for our honeymoon. And I had to take some time at the airport to leave this review because Thai Lion is by far the most horrible airline we’ve ever flown, period. They have no app and their website is complete crap. Always down. So accessing flight details or making changes is a nightmare, which makes the luggage bullet below even more frustrating. We had our flight cancelled and rescheduled 3 times within 48 - 24 hours from our flight which really cut into our plans in Bali. No explanation, simply an email sent. So we basically had to wake up at 3:00am to make our rescheduled flight, which still gets us there LATER than anticipated because of the layover. - We get to the airline and they dropped our luggage from our original tickets and would not let us check in without paying for luggage again. My husband (being the typical man, though he’s fairly good at this stuff) didn’t have a receipt so we had to repay for luggage. When you pay for luggage, you have to run to a separate counter and come BACK to the check-in area because they can’t process payments at the check-in area. What?! What century are you living in? Because we have a transfer in Bangkok, we have to pick up our own luggage from baggage claim and re-check it into our next flight. The hassle just keeps getting worse! We finally get on the plane and notice my husband and I’s seats have been separated by an entire row. Which isn’t a huge deal, but just a cherry on top of all the chaos. We finally get on and the plane is dirty. Still trash from the last flight. Another cherry on top. We almost missed our triple delayed flight to Bali all because of the incompetence of Thai Lion. And we weren’t even the most unlucky ones. Some people got dropped completely during the flight changes and were left stranded at the airport! Just don’t do it. Do yourself the favor and pay a little more for a separate airline - avoid the frustration, hassle, and risk. Wish we head know beforehand because we definitely would have.

### "I had to pay for the flight twice"
Not Verified |  After payment, I received a popup window telling me my booking failed and I need to try again. I then tried to contact the airline via phone and email for a booking confirmation. On the phone I was in the waiting line forever until I gave up and on my email I only received an answer over a week later, what was the day of my departure. Never have I received a bookig confirmation and then they write me 2 hours before schedueled flight time, that I am booked for the flight and can proceed check-in! Not knowing if I had a flight ticket, I booked a couple of days before my departure date with a different airline. I tried to resolve the matter with Lion Air, but their customer service is absolutely useless, replies weren't read, templates sent out, long periods between responses. I then requested a chargeback from my credit card provider what got turned down in the end. So I had to pay for the flight twice. Only to save a few Baht I would think twice now. Maybe a bigger provider is the better option.

### "The worst company"
Phuket to Bangkok. I booked a round trip on trip.com from Bangkok to Phuket including a baggage 12 kg. When I return they said that the baggage wasn’t included to the return fight on 11 February. They demand 950 baht / 29 euro. The worst company. Avoid them.

### "customer service is the worst"
Not Verified |  Tokyo Narita to Bali. Be sure to pay for baggage when purchasing ticket. We did not, and tried using their website a day in advance of our flight. No luck with the website, we went to the airport in Bali 5 hours ahead of our flight to get our bags prepaid. That failed as well ... there office was closed. Once the counter opened we were hustled into paying 430 US dollars for two suitcases, the heaviest weighed in at 12 kilos. No supervisor to be found. Ruined the ending of what was a great trip. Thai lion Air customer service is the worst.

### "Not bad at all"
Krabi to Hanoi via Bangkok. Not bad at all. After reading reviews I was surprised. Paying for hold baggage was a pain and took a few phone calls but I managed. Paying at check-in is hugely expensive, which is common for budget airlines. Prepaying is much cheaper. Check in was fast and courteous. Boarding was no less manic than any other airline in Thailand. Flight was short and fine. As expected for an economy short flight. Bit of a Ryanair experience to be fair.

### "a terrible airline to travel with"
Kathmandu to Bangkok. This is a terrible airline to travel with. Please beware. This is the second time I am flying with Thai Lion Air and both times the flight was delayed. This time, it was delayed over 26 hours, and the boarding crew kept telling us that the plane was delayed for 2 hours, but we waited 11 hours at the airport. In the end the flight was cancelled and they put us up in a terrible hotel which did not even have hot water for a shower. They told us that we were going to leave in the morning, but in the end the flight was scheduled to leave at 2.15 pm and even then, the flight was delayed again. This is a terrible experience and I would not recommend anyone to fly with Thai Lion Air.

### "the trip was really good"
Denpasar to Bangkok. Our flight was perfect, check in was 5 minutes, departed on time, crew were polite, arrived on time. Plane was not super comfortable but was fine with sufficient leg space. Considering the flight cost us 100 dollars the trip was really good.

### "cheap way to fly around Asia"
Bangkok to Krabi. A cheap way to fly around Asia, knowing that, I don’t think you will be too disappointed with the no leg room, no customer service, excessive charges on carry on and checked baggage. So make sure you have your carry on weighed before you head to airport. Then if you check any bag it’s very very expensive. Somehow I made changes (twice) to my ticket. And after the whole transaction went through, they said they didn’t accept US credit cards! In shock. But the hotel clerk went into the site where I bought the ticket and twice was able to input my cc information. Just be aware, it’s Thailand, low cost carrier.

### "Ridiculous policy on carry-on"
Not Verified |  Bangkok to Chiang Mai. Ridiculous policy on carry-on bags. If your bag weighs more than 7k you have to take items out of your bag and hold them. I ended up walking with my backpack, neck pillow, toiletry bag, running shoes and make up bag. It was so inconvenient that I just put my stuff back in my bag, but there was another scale at the gate before boarding so we had to go through the process again. When we got on the plane we stowed the carry on bags and just put all the extra items up in the overhead compartments, completely defeating the purpose of lightening our bags. Once seated my partner and I took out our lunches that we’d packed, only to be told that in fact, outside food isn’t allowed on the plane,there were no signs or announcements outlining this policy. We had to sneak bites of our food during the flight. When we landed the airline operated shuttle bus was broken and we had to stand in the isles (holding all of our items that had been pulled from our bags) for 25 minutes. Overall it was a pretty funny experience! Weird policies (attempt to make more money by charging baggage fees and making people buy food on the plane?) and one inconvenience after another!

### "had to pay for my bag twice"
Bangkok to Phuket. Flight was 25min late and changed time of my flight (still through thai lion) had to pay for my bag twice even though was still through same airline. (2 flights one from Chiang mai to Bangkok then Bangkok to Phuket) both same airline. I checked in online 24hrs before and paid for baggage but when I arrived to check, they told me it wasn’t paid for. The lady in Chiang Mai was able to find my reservation for checked bag but when I had to go to baggage claim go through airport again to go through same airline (made no sense) they couldn’t find my reservation for my bag so I spent 30min dealing with that and still had to pay again. Horrible experience.

### "they have lots of issues"
Bangkok to Osaka. Again, confusion over check-in times. Email sent 24 hours before said open 4 hours before, web-site said 3 hours and screens at the airport showed a check-in row number more than 5 hours before. Approached the check-in desk, which then had almost no queues, to be told that check-in opened at 2 am - 3.5 hours before the flight. All this information is completely contradictory and confusing. Returned to the check-in desk at 2 am and checked in very quickly - no waiting at all. Seat numbers had been changed (again) from those booked and paid for (due to aircraft change) but staff very helpful in moving us to more appropriate seats. Why don’t they communicate with customers when pre-selected and paid for seats are changed? This would at least give customers the option of trying to amend their booking to choose different seats, or automatically refund the price paid. I lost money by buying 25kg of luggage when my bag actually weighed less than 22kg. It’s crazy to expect customers to be able to predict their bag weight to the nearest kilogram, so inevitably people presumably end up buying more than they need. An enlightened approach to customer service is needed here. How about automatically refunding unused pre-paid luggage, considering the lucrative revenue stream they must generate from charging people at check-in who have underpaid? Fast and smooth through immigration and security. The long bus journey to aircraft via Gate 1 - groan. On time departure and arrival, uneventful flight. (The flight was re-timed several months before departure from 04:30 departure to 05:20. This was communicated effectively by email but was annoying nonetheless). Overall, considering this and the previously-reviewed outward flight, I might use this airline again if the price was right. However, they have lots of issues with their website, booking system, communications and policies generally that - even for a budget airline - leave areas where improvements could be made. There is room in the market for a low-cost operator to also show that they care about their customers - a lot of initiatives are not expensive. The check-in staff who helped me with my seats today got close and made a good impression, but the company itself has much more to do.

### "Crew was courteous"
Bangkok to Jakarta. No online check in possible, but the airport check in was smooth. Staff extremely lenient about grossly oversized hand luggage carried by many. Flight departed on time and arrived 15 minutes early. I was given an emergency row seat but could also find several empty rows on board, making for a comfy journey. Crew was courteous, only customs forms were not provided.

### "satisfactory for a budget airline"
Osaka to Bangkok with Thai Lion Air. Original ticket booking was difficult, taking several attempts before the payment went through. Have to book baggage per exact kilogram, which is difficult to accurately predict months before the flight. Inevitably you end up buying more weight than you need and therefore overpaying. It would be better to have weight bands (e.g. 15 to 20kg, 20 to 25kg etc) like Air Asia and others do. Website said check in open 3 hours before departure. Email sent day before said 4 hours. Actually opened 2.5 hours before. Email suggested checking-in online, but website said this was “not possible for international flights.” Email was received 24 hours before flight and mentioned booking meals “up to 48 hours” before departure. So confusing and difficult to plan arrival time and other arrangements at the airport. Extremely slow check-in, with many passengers having baggage and other problems. Strict application of 7kg hand luggage policy. Payment for excess baggage in cash (JPY) only. Not a problem for me because I had pre-paid my baggage when I bought the ticket. Seat numbers changed even though seats had been selected and paid for when flight ticket purchased. Booked and paid for Row 12, reminder email said Row 3 and boarding pass said Row 20. Apparently this was connected to a change of aircraft in 3+3 seat formation (Boeing 737-800) - not what I had expected or was shown when I booked. I will request a refund for the fee I paid for the original seats. Flight on time. Smooth boarding etc. Plenty of empty seats so had three seats for two people. Free pastry and cup of water unexpectedly provided. Seats, service and other on-board issues satisfactory for a budget airline. Extremely quick out of DMK - no queues at passport control, short wait for luggage, no wait for taxi.

### "Seats felt cramped"
Hanoi to Bangkok. Check in was reasonably fast and hassle-free, but the plane both left and arrived half an hour late. Seats felt cramped and the aircraft overcrowded. Crew looked tired. But it got us there.

### "waiting to refund my money"
Denpasar to Bangkok.I received my fragile item in many pieces at Bangkok airport and they didn’t want accept their responsibility. They forgot to served our meals (me and my 12 years old son) so we bought inside the airplane and I am waiting to refund my money for the food back.

### "flight no longer exists"
Don't book tickets here as they have the poorest airline customer service I've ever experience. We booked tickets from Bangkok to Phuket 2 months prior and they confirmed the flight. We arrived in the said airport and surprisingly flight no longer exists as the flight we booked was under summer promo (or whatever they called it) and why the heck did they confirm it in the first place? They claimed that they sent an update about our flight 4 days before our departure (which we didn't receive) and they didn't even bother that there was no acknowledgement from the passengers about this changes. The only thing they can offer was a "full refund" and book another ticket with another airline if you really wanted to be in Phuket to follow your itinerary (which will cost you double from original price). They won't be bothered if your running behind from your itinerary, they won't give you any assistance or even small compensation for the inconvenience they caused.

### "definitely fly with them again"
Kathmandu to Bangkok. Absolutely perfect. Check-in staff were great. The plane was new and we even received a very good inflight snack and bottle of water - I have never received this with any other low-cost airline. We pre-ordered an inflight meal which not only was reasonably priced but also very tasty. I previously read that the airline was keen on over-sized cabin luggage but was astonished at the luggage that people tried to get away with in the cabin - this is unfair on other passengers who are compliant and then made to put their (compliant) luggage under their seat in front of then whilst overladen passengers get away with putting their luggage in the cabins above (and have foot-room as well). We did have a delay but this was due to the re-surfacing of KTM runway and the congested skies above the airport as a consequence. Luggage arrived on the belt at DMK before we did! The price of the ticket was exceptionally good (but may be due to DMK to KTM being a new route). I had no problem adding three lots of hold baggage post-booking using my UK credit card (I didn't even make my original booking with Thai Lionair but with an online travel agent). I would definitely fly with them again.

### "no updates at all"
Flying with Thai Lion Air is definitely the worst traveling experience in my entire life so far. I have no I idea how their business still survives to this day. I bought my ticket through Traveloka - a third party. I also purchased check in luggage in advance, together with the ticket although their charge for this was surprisingly expensive for a domestic flight from a low-cost airline. About 1 month prior to my departure date, I was informed that my flight had been rescheduled, which was totally no problem to me. However, on my departure date, I gave myself 2 hours in Don Mueang Airport. I kept looking at the screen and couldn't find any info about my flight number, which row to check in and so on. It was like the flight number SL 524 never existed. I checked my mobile app and e-mail again and again, no updates at all. Then I asked the ground staff, they looked at the confirmation and told me to keep queuing and waiting. I was supposed to depart at 4.00pm. Finally, my turn to check in at the counter came, it was about 3.00pm then. The check in staff of Thai Lion Air looked at me like I am an idiot. She took my passport away and came back about 5 minutes later. She told me that "Madame, you flight time changed, Madame, 3.30pm, hurry up. No check in luggage now, cannot load. All carry-on Madame". I was totally shocked, literally. She only gave me my passport and boarding pass and kept urging 'Hurry up, hurry up'. She didn't even give me the last minute passenger tag or something like that to let other departments prioritize my following steps before I could board my flight. And of course, no one from this airline accompanied my next steps. Only the hurry up yelling lady! I rushed to the security counter like never before. The nightmare continued, the departure time was coming so close and the security staff asked me to open my suitcase to check - skincare products, sunscreen and many other things. That was why I pre-purchased check-in luggage. Then I had a bunch of my stuff all thrown away at the security counter, continued running like hell to the gate. I was the last person to get on the plane as flight attendants whispering to each other "Vietnamese". How funny it was to be treated this way. Notified flight time change 30 minutes in advance, paid for check-in luggage, had a bunch of stuff thrown away then had to carry every single thing onto the aeroplane and even being sarcastically mocked for my nationality. And none of these was my fault. That day was a disaster. From the ground staff at Don Mueang Airport to the check in staff from Thai Lion Air, all showed absolutely fantastic responsibility and support! The tips with this airlines is very simple - don't fly with them. Their prices can be cheap, but if you go with them, be prepared for the nightmare ahead!

### "baggage wasn’t ‘in their system"
Denpasar to Bangkok. Thai Lion scammed me using the same baggage trick that others online have described. I pre-booked checked baggage but the woman said it wasn’t ‘in their system’. even after showing evidence with an e-ticket specifying 15kg paid, Thai Lion Air still tried to get me to pay $220 extra for baggage on a flight that cost $160. I booked another flight with Jetstar instead for half the price, refusing to pay any more money into this scam airline. This happened in Denpasar airport. Thai Lion Air are scammers and should be shut down.

### "Absolutely terrible airline"
Bangkok to Surat Thani. This is a terrible airline. The A/C didn’t work for the first 30 minutes or last 20 minutes (only worked for 30 minutes) of the flight. The temperature in Bangkok was 86 degrees Fahrenheit, so being stuck inside a packed plane with no moving air made it extremely hot, humid and stuffy. Passengers were using magazines to fan themselves and myself was dripping in sweat. It is ridiculous that a airline can think this is okay for customers. They clearly don’t care about their customers. There was also gum stuck to the handle. So gross to think they don’t even clean their planes either. Absolutely terrible airline. Avoid this airline if possible.

### "new depths of poor service"
Denpassar to Chiang Mai via Bangkok. I know not to expect silver service when booking a budget airline, but this airline is truly plumbing new depths of poor service and hidden money grabbing ploys. The staff are arrogant, unfriendly and a disgrace. The legroom on my 5 hour flight was not even suitable for a short domestic hop, let alone an international flight. The money saved in tickets is not worth the hassle and discomfort.

### "very much below expectation"
Bali to Bangkok. Overall very much below expectations. On a Bangkok to Bali: delayed departure of 1h. It happens. But then on Bali Airport tarmac, we had to wait 20 minutes for the bus to arrive and take us to the Terminal. On the way back: smooth until you wait 30 minutes for the luggage at the belt. For both cases: no communication whatsoever which is far worst. Staff are nice and smiling. But also having fun, chatting, eating out in the open. Having fun at work is great of course, but not when it goes against service quality. I will avoid this airline in the future.

### "Staff are very friendly and polite"
Hat Yai to Don Muang with Thai Lion Air. Staff are very friendly and polite, staff member took me to my seat and put my carry on bag in the over head bin for me. The seat is comfortable. The airplane take off and landing was smooth. The flight departed and arrived on time. The fare is very reasonable, better than the bus and the train if you book in advance. Before buying ticket the travel agent let me know ahead one small carry on luggage is free. The other luggage will be charged.

### "extremely unpleasant journey"
Bangkok to Surat Thani. If you want to enjoy having an extremely unpleasant journey, I recommend you to take Thai Lion Air. This airline seems to want making money with every little thing they can. Watch out if the weight your luggage might be a bit more than you paid in advance (If you had the luck and prepaid for it at all). The fees for overweight luggage are extremely high. Thus ending up paying more than the original ticket price is not uncommon. When I took this airline from Bangkok to Surat Thani, most of the people seemed to pack everything they could into their hand luggage for not having to pay these fees. For quite a few passengers, there was hardly any space left. This is not only uncomfortably and shows a lack of customer care but is a safety risk as well. My flight was delayed because of bad weather conditions but even though the screens showed a delay, the staff wasn't informed about it at all when we asked them. Apart from that, I wonder why people who can hardly speak any English at all can qualify to work at an airline like this. Nevertheless, they have a strict no food policy and the seats are narrow and cannot recline. There are plenty of much more pleasant airlines going to their destinations too. It's your choice.

### "unprofessional and unfriendly staff"
Not Verified |  Phuket to Bangkok. I have nothing good to say about them. Was only told that flight was canceled upon arrival at the air. Got booked onto another flight 8hrs later. Very expensive luggage charges, no leg room and very unprofessional and unfriendly staff. Was traveling with my family and had a really rough time.

### "I took my phone out to film"
Not Verified |  Denpasar to Bangkok. I traveled only with pound sterling and a visa and MasterCard. Onboard the flight for food and drink I was told Thai bhat, US dollars or no drink. I didn’t have any of those currencies. I explained that I still needed to drink and asked if I could have some tap water or staff water the response was no. After an hour of begging for water I was  given a shot size cup of boiling hot water. After a further 2 hours I decided enough was enough so went up again and asked if one of the staff would mind allowing me one of the staff drinks just a 500ml bottle of water the response again was no. I couldn’t believe it so I took my phone out to film what was happening to me. The cabin crew member grabbed my phone and made me delete the footage of him. In return for the commotion and deleting the photo, I was given a second thimble full of water.

### "Nothing is offered free"
Bangkok to Chiang Rai. The gate closed 15 minutes pass the departure time to pack on more passengers. Slow boarding and unboarding system (30 minutes delay). Nothing is offered free, water costs money.

### "Terrible service and flights"
Tokyo to Bangkok. Terrible service and flights. They had an engine problem in Tokyo which delayed me for 3 hours. Missed all connections and they said it wasn’t their problem. Dumped me in the middle of the night in Bangkok with no accommodation. Also, they run a no outside food and drink policy. Will  not let you on with drinks. Then they try to sell you food on the plane. One sandwich for a 9 hour journey. Joke. They have films to watch, but no earphones! You have to buy them. But if you’re connecting you probably won’t even have Thai Bhat. Staff are rude and aggressive. And no toilet paper in the toilet.

### "never fly Thai Lion Air again"
Dhaka to Bangkok. Thai Lion Air has some of the worst service I have experienced as a frequent traveler. When I called to have baggage added, they were unable to accept US credit card payments. The representative promised me that the payment would be according to the online amount (about 30 USD) since I couldn't reserve this baggage over the phone or online. She said that as long as I was in line at least four hours before my flight, I would be charged the online price. When got in line 5.5 hours ahead of time, the counter representatives were so inefficient that once I reached the counter, they charged me for about 300 USD without verifying the amount with me. I then disputed this amount, but Thai Lion Air will not acknowledge 1) their own inefficiencies of taking 2 hours to service the baggage check in, their own poor customer service both in informing about baggage pricing and honoring what was agreed upon, and 3) their outdated technology that cannot accept US credit cards. I will never fly Thai Lion Air againr.

### "very much disappointed"
Dhaka to Bangkok. I have used the aircraft of Thai Lion Air for this route. Their seat are very congested and cheap with the delayed time, which was very painful for all the passengers. They provide snacks after delayed in flight which was worst in taste and quality. Even though they didn't take any kind of activities for the passengers, who all were very much disappointed with the Thai Lion Air. Everyone including me said they never use Thai Lion Air in future.

### "cannot recommend this airline"
Not Verified |  Shenzhen to Bangkok. Very bad service. Two time the flight was delayed 1 hour. Huge extra costs on baggage. The on board food is disgusting and even it would be good much too expensive. I cannot recommend this airline and I will avoid consider them again.

### "cramped with little legroom"
Bangkok to Chiang Mai. Thai lion air is a subsidiary of Lion Air. Aircraft was cramped with little legroom. Landing was rough & bumpy. The flight took off & landed on time.

### "such a terrible service"
Bangkok to Chiang Mai. One of the worst service from airline I ever had. The late evening flight was canceled recently, therefore they moved all flight to the evening flight. The change was made normally and I received notification as usual. But this time I received such a terrible service. Starting from mis-booking the flight by switching my departure flight and arrival flight, which making me unable to do the online check in. This problem occurs again on my return flight. I have contacted call center and the response I received is unacceptable. Firstly they started to ask me to check in online again in the morning, and of course, it did not work. So I kept calling again and received the response that “this problem is unexplainable, especially to customer. Even he explained to me, I am not going to understand anyway”. I had good service from this airline before, but this time could be the last one.

### "charges for luggage are very high"
I was flying from Bali to Mumbai via Bangkok, while checking luggage I was told that check-in is not allowed and I had to pay extra 220$ for the same. Their charges for luggage are very high. Its totally unacceptable. Which airline charge check-in luggage wholly. I will never recommend this airline. And after paying so much you don't even get a glass of water you have to buy it. Totally disappointed and frustrated. They purposely tell you about check-in baggage prices on last moment when you don't have any other option.

### "very high price for baggage"
Bali to Bangkok. Very unprofessional airline. Did not know about check in baggage. Charged very high price for baggage. Had to pay 220 USD for check in baggage. Never fly this airline.

### "never fly Thai Lion again"
Phuket to Hanoi via Bangkok. I booked a ticket that cost $20 more, with the belief that I was getting a pre-paid bag included. Apparently this was not the case. So, I learn at check-in that because I didn't pre-book my bag, I would have to pay 300 THB ($10 USD) per KG. My bag wieghed 16.6kg. So, they wanted me to pay $166 USD to check my bag! I said hell no! My bodyweight plus my carry-on was 84kg of weight and I paid $84 USD for my ticket. (It was listed at $67 but I paid extra, thinking the checked bag was included) I said I would just book a flight with another airline and check my bag for that price. I checked prices online and I would still have had close to $50 left over too, even with it being last minute! So, what did they do? They looked at the competing prices and said if I bought a new ticket on a domestic flight, the bag would be included "free". The new flight cost $83. This undercut the competition just enough where it made sense for me not to go to a competing airline. I really couldn't afford to do anything but accept their offer. And I did not get refunded for the first flight that I booked! I was also told that if I had been there four hours before the flight left, I could have checked my bag at a much lower rate. I sat and waited for their counter to open, from 3:15AM until 5:00AM. My flight wasn't scheduled to leave until 7:25AM. The employees came and sat at their desks for more than an hour before letting me come to the counter! If I had been given service when I got there I could have gotten the discounted rate, but  I couldn't get it. This is unacceptable! I will never fly Thai Lion again.

### "have to pay for luggage"
Phuket to Kuala Lumpur. I tried to pay for baggage online. They did not allow to make payment after putting pnr number I have used my mobile as I did or have laptop or PC Then I called them to pay for 60kg for 4 person, they said 15kg per person is included to check in. I was 3.5 hours before my flight at airport they said you have to pay for luggage and the cost is 400 baht per kg per flight.

### "won't allow extra luggage"
Phuket to Bangkok. They do not have transparent luggage policy. While booking you will not see any kind of luggage limit or so on, but while travelling they won't allow you with extra luggage. My travel cost was around 2300 THB for two person, and for extra luggage I have to pay around 7000 THB. Very cheap service, they are not contactable anyhow, nor they will reply to your feedback or emails. Even the water is chargeable during flight. I personally suggest do not travel with this airline.

### "ended up cancelling the flight"
Not Verified | Bangkok to Taipei. First, it is very hard to get the customer service to reply by email or phone. Once you are luck to reach them by phone, you will find out the process - reschedule or cancellation is horrible. I ended up cancelling the flight as I am tired of listening to all those unprofessional customer representative that probably trained to put the best interest of the company instead of being realistic and fair to the customers. The cancellation process is horrible that you have to send the passport and flight details again which they should have those info already. I will never book the flight from Thai Lion Air as this is my first time to book and the experience of booking, reschedule, cancellation and customer service are all really bad that I can not imagine the experience of getting on the flight.

### "scam on baggage costs"
Chiang Mai to Bangkok. This company operates a scam on baggage costs where the website and call centre will not accept pre payment for checked baggage and then when you arrive to the airport they charge exorbitant fees per kilo (working out to be 4x the price of ticket in first place.They then recommended us to buy a new ticket with 20kg luggage included which worked out cheaper, then on complaining they eventually recommended it’d be cheaper for it to go on a cargo flight instead!) Ridiculous. The staff were rude and unhelpful. Then the flight was delayed and the seats so uncomfortable with no legroom.

### "worst customer service"
Not Verified | Bangkok to Chiang Mai. Never fly with Thai Lion. They charge you 300 baht per Kg for your baggage. They do claim on their website the premium economy allows 20kg baggage for free, however, they don't even have premium economy seats. If you want to experience worst customer service, delayed flight, pay hundred bucks for your baggage - then fly Thai Lion.

### "the mobile site did not work"
Surat Thani to Bangkok. When we tried adding extra baggage the mobile site did not work. We tried the process on 2 different phones on the evening beforehand. Since we were travelling and had to reach deadlines we were not able to complete the process online. When we arrived at the airport they charged 300 baht per kilo of checked in baggage. Initially they were asking for 4500 baht (around 150€) for the 15 kg bag, but I managed to get it down to 9 kg by throwing belongings away and packing stuff into the carry on baggage. This exceeds the cost of the flight and is unacceptable in my eyes. While booking they never showed the costs for this and I am steaming over the fact their mobile site was this useless. Personel was of little to no help and I refuse to fly with them in the future.

### "Horrible prices for luggage"
Bangkok to Khon Kaen. Horrible prices for luggage. Not clear in booking confirmation what was included. Paid 4300 ฿ for 2 tickets and had to pay 7800 ฿ at the airport for 2 pieces of luggage (one each passenger).

### "impossible to buy baggage on line"
Udon thani to Bangkok. Baggage Rip off airline -  the airline makes it impossible to buy baggage on line or by phone, and slaps a 300 baht: kg bill at you at check in. I say intentionally because none of the channel works, we tried it for more than 24 hours. Online does not allow purchase, customer care number rings out no one picks up (15 calls), social media contacts do not respond, so is an email not responded. All channels down at the same time can not be accidental. Ultimately we had t purchase a new ticket at 2240 baht with 20 kg baggage allowance while the purchase online would have costed 400 baht. Airline does not offer remedial measures as the mistake is clearly theirs and I was forced to pay instead.

### "Don't fly with Thai Lion"
Like many other Thai Lion customers, my partner and I experienced terrible customer service in Kathmandu. When we attempted to check in to our flight to Bangkok the attempted to charge us an exorbitant $289 baggage fee, effectively doubling the cost of our flight. When my partner and I pushed back on this unnecessary expense and asked for more information, they explained each additional kilogram over the first seven cost $17. However, my partner's bag - the one causing the expense - weighed approximately 17 kilograms, meaning the excess baggage fee should have been $170, per Thai Lion's own policy. The staff could not explain the $289 calculation. When we refused to pay the fee, these customer service agents withheld our passports and threatened to bar us from boarding the flight. Needless to say, my partner and I were furious with this extortion. After more angry back and forth, they explained that since we purchased our flight tickets in November 2018, we were exempt from Thai Lion's baggage policy, which went into effect in January 2019. They did not apologize for misleading and threatening us. In 20+ years of frequent flying, I have never encountered such poor customer service, even on budget airlines. Word to the wise: Don't fly with Thai Lion. If you must, check the date of your ticket purchase. Any tickets purchased prior to the January 2019 policy change are exempt from the draconian baggage policy.

### "scam with it's baggage policy"
Chiang Rai to Denpasar via Bangkok. This airline has quite a scam going with it's baggage policy. I travel a lot and am normally pretty good at avoiding some of the traps that budget airlines set up (or at least being aware of them). The day before our flight I went to check in online and take care of baggage and things like that. Everytime I tried to complete check-in, I would get an error screen. I downloaded the app and it would crash everytime I tried to even enter my boarding number. So as most people would, I gave up and decided to take care of it at the airport the next morning. If you don't buy luggage more than 4 hours before the flight they charge every kg as "overage" weight. We were at first quoted about $1,000 for our two bags. I told them that the website was broken and we were unable to buy them ahead of time. I even showed them the app crashing on my phone. They eventually changed the total price to $350 for our two 18kg bags after we pressed them, when they made an "exception" because our 2nd flight was more than 4 hours away. They also have a "no outside food policy" meaning you aren't allowed to bring any food on the plane. Stay far away from them. TLDR: $350 USD for 2 bags totalling 36 kg between the two of them.

### "Complaint is about Check In"
Not Verified |  Udon Thani to Bangkok. My Complaint is about their Check In Staff at Udon Thani Airport, We never had any Baggage to check in  Only had 1 "approved" Cabin Bag & weighing 10 kgs in total, this was for 2 Passengers, so well within their 7kg per pax limit. We checked in & I Was told "You Cannot take that bag into the cabin". I pointed out it was Approved Size Cabin Baggage, but in the eyes of the check in staff there was no way they were going to let us board our flight. They Made us go to a shop & buy 2 plastic bags & transfer our clothes from my Approved Cabin bag into these 2 Plastic Bags. What made me Angry was that there were a lot Of bags in the cabin either the same size & Some Even Bigger than Mine. There was NO Problems with the actual flights apart from a 20 Minute Delay on both sectors, but that happens.

### "Never flying them again"
Mumbai to Yangon via Bangkok. They are seriously out to scam. I had to pay 322 USD for 10 kg of checked in luggage from India to Myanmar. My boyfriend and I tried checking previously what my baggage allowance was but it was not clear on the ticket (Nothing was written about baggage allowance) or on the website. I saw in numerous places that they allowed 20 kg so figured out I’d be fine or else the worst case scenario I’d have to pay 100 usd or so. But $300 is way more than the actual ticket cost. The baggage prices are exorbitant and it seems like the airline intentionally tried to hide the baggage price requirement. There was no information about it whatsoever on the ticket and finding information on the website was extremely difficult/unclear. Never flying them again.

### "out of date service"
. Flying Thai Lion from Singapore to Chiang Rai via Bangkok return and we got delayed on 1 leg so a 25% delay rate. Mostly old and worn aircrafts 737s but also out of date service. Wanted to pay by credit card but no not possible on flight. Wanted to buy wine - no not possible. Wanted then to buy beer which was available on 1 leg out of the 4 flights I have probably flown 500 times and never not been able to buy a beer on a flight. Yes I know it is Asia and budget but I regularly fly Jetstar and AirAsia wo any problems. Luckily AirAsia has now opened a direct flight on the route so good but Thai Lion!

### "Save yourself the stress"
Krabi to Bangkok. Our family flew this airline March 25, 2019. After travelling 2 different countries and numerous flights for 3 weeks with no problem, our encounter at Thai Lion Air was horrible. I am not a person to write reviews but I have realized how important they are for others who might need advice before making a choice. Do yourself a favour and pay a few extra dollars to fly with someone else. This airline will absolutely gauge you at the checkout demanding you pay for baggage you are carrying on at ridiculous prices. Not only was it despicable, but the ticket agent began to yell at us when we started to question this! We have been traveling for 3 weeks with carry on only and have not had one problem yet. Not one! The amount they wanted to charge us for carryon backpacks was double our plane ticket! Completely ridiculous. Also very stressful as their only option was to pay or miss your flight. Horrible practices, horrible customer service. Do not use this airline. Save yourself the stress.

### "Absolutely horrible airline"
Absolutely horrible airline. Paid for the online option for checked baggage and when we arrived they said they had no history of any payment. We had 20kgs of luggage and they charged us $700 USD to get on the flight. I have never written a bad review for anywhere and I am absolutely outraged. I will never fly Thai Lion Air again. Horrible airline.

### "never fly Thai Lion Air again"
Phuket to Nagoya via Bangkok. I paid about 145 USD for the flight and tried to pay for excess baggage (about 80 USD for 20kg) on their website several times, but each time, the website denied my payment, despite my card having no problems. When it was time to check in, they asked for 500 USD to check my bag in. I understand most airlines charge more money at the check in counter, but it is extortion to ask for a customer to pay that amount in such short notice with no other options other than to miss the flight. I was not the only customer to have a problem paying on the website and it is ridiculous and a terrible service to have such an outrageous policy. I will never fly Thai Lion Air again.

### "more and more annoying rules"
Have been a very frequent flier with Thai Lion Air over the last five years (probably around 100 times domestically). But year after year, more and more annoying “rules” (especially the now rather high charges for check-in luggage, higher than for instance on domestic flights in the USA!). On this flight, I tried to check in online. Always system error, only to be told at counter that online check-in internationally is not possible. Why then offer online check-in? By accident, I realized that there is no longer a free luggage allowance (English version of website still shows 20kg when trying to buy extra luggage). On this flight, a potential safety issue? Nobody sat in the emergency exit row in the middle of the plane (plane probably 80% full). Before take-off, a flight attendant addressed us five passengers sitting in the row behind the emergency exit row with “Since you are sitting in the emergency exit row...”. I stopped her right away, bringing to her attention that actually, nobody was sitting in any of the seats in that row. She did not seem concerned. I then suggested that some of us move to those seats, which we did after her “ok”. Admittedly, one flight attendant sat in the jumpseat on the right side of the emergency exit row during take-off and landing. But this experience made me feel rather uneasy, a low concern for security by the airline, possibly? Am now flying AirAsia instead.

### "definitely my last flight"
My company bought me a Thai Lion Air ticket (Bangkok - Bali) through an agent and was told that pre-booking of luggage could only be made by the passenger personally and not by an agent. On the day before my departure I made five attempts to pre-book luggage through Lion Air's webpage (20 kgs, 25 US$ according to the table), but I got the same "System error" message each time I tried. At last I contacted the call center, but was kept waiting for a lenghty period and didn't have time to wait till the end. On the day of departure I went to the airport prepared to be charged a fee for un-booked luggage (expecting double or triple charge), but upon checkin I was met with a luggage charge of 320 US$ - equal to 13 times the pre-booked rate and double the price of the entire plane ticket. The staff were uninterested in the fact that their webpage didn't work. Long story short - I decided to buy an entirely new ticket for the same flight with 20 kgs included (150 US$). Having once again fallen prey to Lion Air's scams, this was definitely my last flight with that airline. Taking into consideration the airline's atrocious safety record and appalling business methods, I don't recommend anyone using this airline unless there are no other alternatives.

### "mistrusted, non-ethical"
Bangkok to Kathmandu. I think all the other comments summarized the kind of service you can expect from this airline. It’s a mistrusted, non-ethical, not reliable and non-authentic company. I received an email only 24 hours in advance saying that if I had more than 6kg of baggage we should pay at least 4 hours before. I had another flight that day, was sick, without counting the fact that wifi isn’t available everywhere in Asia, the chances I saw this email were low. Plus, at the airport, the employee only stated that the policy had changed and I even manage to bargain my overload carry-on baggage with her, reflecting the absence of transparency within that company. Seriously, it’s not the fact that I needed to pay the expensive amount that changed my opinion about this airline but mostly all of the process and because as a consumer flying in couple of hours, you absolutely need to pay the amount they ask you. The right of customers should be defend in those case and I will try my best to advice future/potentials customers about that horrible company.

### "disregard for its customers"
I had written a letter of complaint to Lion Air and received a form letter response: “Dear sir/madam, unfortunately this is our policy”. On January 26th, 2019 I flew Thai Lion Air from Bangkok to Denpasar. I purchased the ticket online for US$166.71 and at the airport was charged an additional check-in baggage at US$110.53 for a total of US$277.23 The website is designed with the intent to deceive. I have since notice that links in website have change regularly and/or have numerous dead links as they were at the time of my booking. I read "inclusive of baggage". I also read "20 kg check in baggage allowance on international flights". In small print I read "as of January 15, 2019". When I clicked the link the website went on at great length as to details for baggage but no fees that I could see were indicated. A reasonable rate for check-in baggage is not accepted upon check-in unless arriving four hours prior. I did in-fact arrive at the check-in counter four hours prior to the departure and was asked to come back an hour later because the check-in attendants were dealing with flights earlier than mine. Check-in attendants were not busy and the line was short so there was no reason not to accept me upon arrival. Regardless, I had no reason to rush and waited by the side. When I returned 3 hours prior to departure the availability of paying a lower rate for check in baggage had expired. My check-in baggage for an international trip lasting more than three weeks was less than 12kg. I was told by the service manager at the counter that the rate of TB3,500 was the best that could be offered. I was not given any other options other than to pay the full fee on top of a relatively high seat cost. Afterwards I was aware that there are several options that passengers took advantage of. I’ve spoken to other passengers regarding Lion Air. The opinions are not flattering and I wish this had been brought to my attention before. Examples include a passenger flying in transit to Australia that negotiated a highly discounted baggage fee which demonstrates Lion Air's inconsistent policy. Furthermore many passengers carry-on more than one bag most exceeding the size and weight stipulated by the metal rack the counter. Descriptions and photographs of the meals offered are grossly misrepresented. The image of pieces of chicken and sauce as depicted are not the gravy-soaked rice that is served. Lion Air's menu is a disgrace to Thai cuisine. Lastly, the flight crew do not distribute immigration cards to passengers. This is standard on international flights. Each of these issues reflect the total disregard for its customers from a company that uses the Thai name.

### "will charge you a fortune"
Krabi to Bangkok. They will charge you a fortune if your bag is other the 7kg (yes, only 7kg) allowed for your cabin bag. You will have to check that bag in and pay for every kg, not for the extra, for every kg of that bag.

### "I recommend this airline"
Bangkok to Colombo. Great flight with free meal. All passenger get 30 kg baggage allowance and a free meal, tasty too. Everything smooth and on time, very cheap flight too. I recommend this airline.

### "asked to pay for 17kg luggage"
Bangkok to Kathmandu. Arrived today to the airport and was asked to pay 8500 baht (over £200) for 17kg luggage. On the booking process there was no option to buy a luggage, so I assumed its free. The staff was rude and there was no way to lower the fee. Most of the people just decided to pay. I did not. Am now in Bangkok awaiting for Nepal Airlines to take me to Kathmandu. Similar cost as the baggage, but at least I have satisfaction not paying a penny to this. Never again.

### "never fly with them again"
Dhaka to Bangkok. Dont use this airline! I booked a flight with them some week ago with extremely bad experience. When booking I used their app and ticked the luggage 15 kg button. On the itinerary I see no luggage included? I call their service center and the lady said I could pay on the airport with a slightly higher price. She would also send me a payment link which never came. At the airport they explained I had to pay 16$/kg, in total 240 $, which was twice the flight price ! !! Talk about low cost airline ! After contacting customer service they explained there was no refund. The airplane was almost empty so they could easily have offer me the standard rate. No wonder it was empty with this treatment. I will never fly with them again.

### "won't fly with them again"
Bangkok to Tianjin. Our tickets were not especially cheap, however to our surprise they did not include any baggage with them. We had to fork out an additional 15,000 baht to take our two suitcases back to China. The staff laughed at me when I agreed to pay, very humiliating. On the plane nothing is given complimentary. On our 5 hour journey, there was no water, drinks, or food provided. You could order drinks but they were too expensive. We bought our own drinks on the plane but were told we were not allowed to consume them. If you are cold, pay extra to rent a blanket. If you are bored, pay extra to rent earphones and watch the movies. I feel ripped off and won't fly with them again.

### "extortionist rates for baggage"
Jakarta to Bangkok. It is cheaper to cancel your flight and rebook with a real airline than pay the exorbitant extortionist rates they charge for baggage. Supposed to be 1 bag free and I paid for 20kg extra. Got to Jakarta airport is was charged IDR 3.1 million (~$230) for 1 bag , which is more than the total round trip cost. The check in was atrocious. I asked for a supervisor who basically told me to pay the fee or not go. I asked if I could Cancel the flight. I was told yes, but no refund. They suck.

### " pay $80 for not prepaid luggage"
Surat Thani to Chiang Mai. I prepaid $12 for luggage for two trips through Thai Lion. One trip Surat thani and one trip back. This includes a flight from Chiang Mai, a transfer in Bangkok and then Bangkok to Surat Thani. They now say that my transfer flight from Bangkok to Surat Thani is considered a separate flight so my Pre-pay luggage was used up! They had me pay $80 for not prepaid luggage. Who the pays twice for luggage on ONE trip with the same airline?! Then to make matters worse is I find a direct flight home through AirAsia that would get me home faster and save me $30 but my airline won’t give me my luggage back so I can’t go! I would give the money and lose the Thai Lion flight, buy the other ticket through AirAsia, get home sooner and save more than what I’m paying for just luggage alone but they won’t do it! What is wrong with people?!? This is not the first time these scams have happened to me from this company. That’s how they make their money. The woman next to me booked a flight that included free luggage up to 20 kilos but they did the same thing to her. They said her flight to the main island was covered but her transfer flight wasn’t. She had to pay $281 in luggage fees alone!

### "Such depressing policies"
Surat Thani to Bangkok. Online you guys are charging 30 baht per kg and on your check-in counter you are charging 300 baht per kg. It was like a punishment for choosing Thai Lion Air. We were ready to pay the penalty of 1200 baht for by  mastercard and the card machine wasn't working. What can be more worse ,roaming on the airport to get your money exchanged and pay your airline. Even after paying 1200 baht, ground staff told us to make our 10kg (single bag) to be split into two pieces and make us put our toiletries and some other thing in cheap polybag. Imagine doing these things again and again on the airport. Such depressing policies.

### "ripping off UK passengers"
Bangkok to Krabi. We were charged £!45 for 15kg of luggage which we could not book on in advance as the site keeps crashing as it cannot take UK credit cards, When you get to the airport having tried like 20 times to book your luggage on they tell you its £10 a kilo for every kilo beyond their pathetic 10kg allowance. So you have to get your flight so you pay it but when you complain later they just say oh it's in our terms and conditions. Just because something is written down in very small print somewhere does not make it fair or appropriate. Shameful ripping off UK passengers on a daily basis.

### "decided to take the train instead"
Surat Thani to Bangkok. They wanted to charge us nearly 10000 Bhat extra for our luggage. When checking in online the day before we found out we hadn’t booked any checked luggage. Since it was not possible to book it when checking in online, we called the booking agent who assured us we could check in our luggage at prices that are listed on their website (around 600 BHT). So this turned out to be a lie. We had to pay nearly 10000. So we decided to take the train instead. Furthermore we were screamed at when they thought we asked for a refund, which hadn’t crossed our mind at that moment. This felt almost like a scam. They never see us back.

### "expensive Premium Seat scam"
Bangkok to Krabi. Thai Lion are both long haul, low cost, no-frills airlines. They get you where you want to go, usually more or less on time, at very very attractive prices. Our team of 15 pax flies often on their domestic and international routes and since we’re usually quite satisfied we’ll continue to do so but don’t fall into the trap of their expensive Premium Seat scam. All their seats are the same. They all have the same width and the “pitch” (the distance for your legs to extend between your row and the row in front of you) is identical in all the rows. At high extra additional prices they sell “Hot Seats”: rows 1-5 in red color, in the front. The seat size is identical but they promise “Priority Boarding” (you’ll be first on) and Priority Disembarkation (you’ll be first off). I attach their promises. The respect neither promise! Being low-cost they rarely use “elephant trunks” (those mobile passageways which for disembarkation allow you to walk directly from the plane to the gate, or for boarding from the gate to the plane). Instead of the elephant trunks they use busses for the transfers to and from the plane. Only One bus is used and all the pax board and disembark simultaneously. No priority whatsoever. When they do use an elephant trunk they board rows 1-20 simultaneously, without any priority or, even worse, they board the back rows first. Thereby, if you’ve been dumb enough to pay for their “priority boarding” you’ll be the last pax to board and you’ll find the overhead bins, in your own front rows, all already fully packed and little or no space for your own carry-ons. Conclusion. Do continue flying on AirAsia and Thai Lion but don’t fall into their sneaky scam. Buy regular Seats. Don’t pay extra for promises of Priorities which they don’t deliver.

### "booked with AirAsia instead"
Yogyakarta to Bangkok  via Jakarta. Checking in luggage will cost you much more than the airfare. I checked in at JOG and was told check in luggage is not included and have pay 22K IDR /kg (1.60 USD). I arrived in Jakarta and had to re-check in for my flight to Bangkok. I was told check in baggage is not included and the policy had changed as of Jan 15. For this flight I was required to pay 224K IDR/kg (16 USD). The airfare was 1.8M (130 USD), cost of checking in luggage 3.9M (282 USD) 217% more than the airfare. I ended up walking away from the flight to Bangkok and booked with AirAsia instead. Part of the problem with not foreseeing these issues is Lion Air does not accept Western credit cards and I had to go through a 3rd party site for booking. After going through this experience, there is absolutely no way I would ever fly with this airline and stick with airlines you can book directly with so there are no surprises.

### "most awful flight experience"
Not Verified |  Bangkok to Hanoi. I booked this flight months in advance but found it difficult to find out if I could check in on line. I was eventually told no. A day before the flight I was sent an email asking if I wanted to check in on line. I tried around 10 times but their system crashed every time. When we arrived at DMK we asked where we should check in we were directed to a queue which didn’t move for 20 minutes. I asked again and was told that our check in desk was at the other end of the terminal. Although I had already paid to upgrade my luggage allowance they tried to charge me again. They also changed my seat allocation without informing me and unfortunately I did not check. The situation at the boarding gate was chaotic and, at times, downright dangerous. Our flight was significantly delayed but there was never any notification that it had been, let alone why. Gates were being changed and, at one time, three different flights from two different airlines were being told that they were boarding form the same gate. There was zero communication from the gate staff who seemed as confused as the passengers as to what was happening. Several ugly scenes arose as flights were boarded without anyone knowing which one. Twice we tried to board the wrong flight. Twice our flight disappeared completely from the indicator board and no one at the desk could explain why. The leg room on the flight was derisory and, while I am not the slimmest person on the planet, I do expect to be able to lower my table fully. This was truly the most awful flight experience I have ever experienced and we have flown with Ryanair several times. We will never fly with this airline again. I would rather pay twice the price than have to endure this experience again.

### "USD300 for a 29 kg bag"
Taipei to Bangkok. I was charged USD300 for a 29 kg bag in an international flight. This was 10 times the price only. A complete scam. They didn't allow me to pay with credit card. I almost lost flight as I wasn't able to withdraw that money from airport ATM.

### "Awful customer service"
Chiang Rai to Bangkok. Horrible customer service- arrived at the airport over 2 hours early to waste an hour and a half of that being told that we could not check in our baggage unless we paid 6900 baht (£175) for our two bags. We had prepaid for 10kg baggage each and were only 3kg over this so should have been able to pay 300 baht/ kg: 900 baht. After trying to explain we had already paid for this we were told to go to a different desk and kept being redirected to other staff- none of which were helpful in the slightest and simply kept repeating “you cannot check in your baggage”. They could clearly see we are two young backpackers concerned about missing our flight and having to pay so much and did not care enough to read our invoice where it evidently says that we paid extra for 10kg baggage each. Staff were chatting amongst each other instead of helping solve the problem and were frankly rude. Awful customer service, it was a horrible experience and can not believe this airline provided absolutely no support. Don’t fly with them, you will be charged absurd prices.

### "money grabbing company"
Udon Thani to Bangkok. Never fly Thai Lion Air. When booking pre paid baggage on the Thai Lion Air website we could not complete the booking due to errors on there site. When arriving at the airport, Thai Lion Air wanted to charge us 1000% for checked in baggage (300 Baht per kg). When we showed them evidence (screen shots) that their website did not allow us to book they still insisted there was nothing they could do. Greedy , Unhelpful money grabbing company.

### "very bad customer service"
Krabi to Bangkok. Never again, they have updated their policy on 15 January 2019. You no can have free luggage anymore, we had to pay an extra 3000 baht for 10kg. This was not communicated to us at all. Flew with them 3 times over the last 6 weeks prior to the update. I wonder if this is even legal, but they have you at gunpoint when your at the airport. To me this is unheard of and very bad customer service.

### "I will never fly them again"
In January, 2019, my husband and I were taking a very short flight from Krabi to Bangkok. This is about a 50 minute flight. This was part of our three week journey through Southeast Asia and we had booked the flight long before we began our trip. People had warned me in advance about the high cost of overweight baggage so I made sure to look into this in advance. Thai Lion Air allows 10 KG of free baggage but I knew we would have more than that since we were traveling for so long. I booked the tickets online and paid with our US credit card. Afterwords I got an email notifying us that if we were going to exceed the 10 KG of free baggage, we should pay in advance for the extra weight so that it would not be as expensive. We attempted to do that online but it wouldn’t except the credit card (the same credit card we had just used to book the flight). We then called customer service and attempted to pay for the added weight with them, but they also told us they could not except US credit cards. They told us that we could pay for the extra baggage weight the day of the flight. That made me nervous so I looked online at their website and it showed that we could pay for an extra 15 KG for 520 baht (which is about $16 USD). I figured that wasn’t the end of the world so didn’t worry about it. When we got to the airport for our flight, they wanted to charge us 4400 baht (or $138 USD) which is twice the amount that we paid for the actual flight tickets! We argued with the woman and she brought over her manager who confirmed that it would be 4400 baht because we didn’t come to the airport to pay at least four hours in advance. The funny thing is, they don’t open until four hours before the flight so there is no way we could have paid more than four hours in advance. Basically, if you have a US credit card, there is no way you can avoid paying overweight baggage fees unless you just keep your weight below 10 KG. This airline is a bunch of con artists and I will never fly them again!

### "Terrible service and management"
Terrible service and management. I took the flight from Bangkok to Krabi and return flight Krabi to Bangkok, Thailand. Both flight were delayed. Bad service from the staff and the airline website is difficult to navigate and no updates for the flights were visible. Not recommended!

### "will not fly with them again"
Krabi to Ubon via Bangkok. Flying from Krabi to Ubon we were unable to check bags through or get tickets for connecting flights in Bangkok. In this day and age that is ridiculous and downright lazy. To collect bags and check in again forced us to run through the airport even with a 2 hour layover. Thai Lion Air should review policies and update to stay competitive. We will not fly with them again.

### "the whole experience was very good"
Flew to Kathmandu with Thai Lion and the whole experience was very good. Baggage Check-in was smooth. Flight took off on time and they also provided complimentary water (small bottle-Nestle) and a cheese roll (snack) on the flight. We also booked pre-flight meals (picture attached - 150 Bt) and it was not that bad. On Return to Bangkok, the journey was also smooth please ensure that your baggage doesn't exceed permitted allowance or you will have to face some hassle. This time we ordered on board meal but they were not that great, please if you fly with the airlines it's better to book pre-board meals in advance. The ones that they offer on board (Rice with Garlic Chicken (130 Bt) and Red Chilly Rice (130 Baht) were not that great and they don't have too many other food options besides some cup noodles and other snacks. For a budget airlines, the overall service was good! - 3 star out of 5.

### "shocked by this behavior"
Singapore to Bangkok. This airline denied me boarding even though I had a confirmed flight. Their own portal sent me the confirmation and receipt for the ticket I paid for. Yet the counter claimed they had no record of the booking and Thai Lion Air claimed I had not paid for the return flight despite having issued a receipt. I am taking this up with my Insurance and consumer protection authorities. I am totally shocked by this behavior.

### "my $400 suitcase damaged"
Not Verified |  Bangkok to Kathmandu; the flight was efficient and smooth there was not any inflight entertainment in more than 3 hours flight. I did not expect either as it was a budget airline. So, BKK - Kathmandu route was OK for me. But while returning back I lost much more than what I saved choosing budget airline. My return flight was on the 30th Oct 2018 from Kathmandu to Bangkok via SL221 and landed in the night at Don Muang airport. The flight was smooth and on time. But unfortunately, I got my $400 suitcase damaged. I could not notice the damage when I collected at the airport. But later once I got into my apartment I did and communicated later with photo of the damaged suitcase and other details, but I did not get any response. Then again, I forwarded my email in the following day but no response! Wish I should have get a least an acknowledgement/response to my email If not the reimbursement! It is really unpleasant for me to get my such an expensive suitcase damaged, therefore, I would think twice before using a budget airline or to travel with cheap suitcase. If you add the benefits including the food/drinks and entertainment that you get free of cost in other airlines (those that are not budget airlines), there is not much saving.

### "being taken advantage of"
Phuket to Bangkok. Thai Lion Air charged us over ten times the posted rate for excess baggage, because we did not give them four hours notice. It is hard enough to navigate all the intricacies of travelling in a different country, without being taken advantage of in such a shame manner. Until now, we have experienced nothing but kindness and hospitality during our time in Thailand. This experience badly impacted this amazing experience.

### "Great value for budget airline"
Bangkok to Jakarta. Great value for a budget airline, as checked-in luggage is included in the basic fare. Plane was clean and the flight was on time. Staff a bit distant, seemingly bothered by passengers present, but nothing horrible. The greatest pain is that this airline doesn't accept payment for tickets with foreign cards, so tickets must be bought via 3rd party sites with a mark-up.

### "worst seat pitch ever"
Flew Thai Lion Air from Bangkok to Krabi. The worst leg room ever. Only 17 centimeters (8.6inch), impossible for a western person to sit properly, leave alone comfortably. Slightly more than the length of a passport, or exactly my 6.4 inch mobile phone. I never sat less comfortably in any airplane in all my life.

### "Just pathetic"
Phuket to Bangkok. Originally scheduled to fly out around 11:50, we woke up quite early to catch the bus as it only comes around once per hour. We ate breakfast, checked out of our hotel, and went to catch the bus. We arrived at the airport only to find our flight had been delayed by nearly 3 hours. So, instead of relaxing in our hotel or the beach, we're stuck waiting an extra 3 hours. They didn't even apologize, nor did they offer any kind of compensation. Just pathetic.

### " not worth the headache"
Surat Thani to Bangkok. You don’t save money by using Thai Lion Air. You get stranded and lots of hassle and additional expense. Due to their flight being late to Surat Thani, my flight to Bangkok took off over 1.5 hours late, causing me to miss my connecting international flight in Bangkok. I notified the staff in Surat Thani as soon as I realized this was going to happen. They pulled my luggage for me to carry rather than check it, and tried to make me throw away all my liquids, including things I had just bought in Thailand. I refused. This didn’t help anyway, as their flight was too late to get through security and get to the outgoing plane on time, even though it was still at the gate. They had told me to go directly to a specific gate when I arrived in Bangkok, saying they had notified them to expect me. When I went to that gate they acted like they didn’t know what I was talking about and sent me to the customer service counter. After running frantically back and forth, they told me I can’t get on my flight and only one flight a day went to my destination so they’d reschedule me for the next day, 24 hours later. When I asked about them getting me a hotel room, the Thai lion employee went into robot mode saying “according to our policy, when our flight is delayed an hour or an hour and a half, we will reschedule your flight for free”. She wouldn’t answer my question about a hotel room and just kept repeating that phrase. She literally just didn’t care what happened to me. I called their customer service number who would only tell me to talk to the staff at the airport. So I was stuck in the airport. I ended up having to book a hotel at my own expense and pay a taxi to get me there. Totally not worth the headache, aggravation, and additional expense. Save your money and fly on an airline who cares about their customers.

### "This airline is a nightmare"
Not Verified |  The worst airline I have traveled with in 20 years. All flights booked were delayed. We traveled from Krabi to Bangkok, which was 1 hour delayed and an additional 1 sitting on the plane before we can get out of the airplane. We were late for our flight to Chiang Mai from Bangkok, which was booked on the same airline. Because of this we missed the flight, they rebook us for the 10:40 flights to Chiang Mai which was also delayed for another 40 minutes. There was a flight at 9:4pm which we were not booked on and we had to wait 6 hours between our missed flight to the newly booked flights. I have to stay standing at the ticket counter for 1 hour plus to rebook our missed flights and this was not even due to my own fault. On our flight back from Chiang Mai to Bangkok, the flight was also 1hr 30 minutes delay. This airline is a nightmare, not worth the 10 to 20 dollars saved. Book another airlines. I will never use this airline again. It is unreliable and consistently late and unorganized.

### " will use them again"
Bangkok to Singapore. A very efficient journey from check in to arrival. The aircraft was new, crew well trained and courteous and the flight well managed despite the light turbulence. My first flight on Lion Air Thai and I will use them again.

### "Terrible airline experience"
Terrible airline experience. Upon boarding we all sat in sweltering heat. No AC at all during boarding. The service cart zoomed through the cabin not offering so much as a glass of water. Upon arrival at Don Mueang Airport, we had to wait on the plane for over 20 minutes for the shuttle bus to arrive. We had to wait an additional 30 minutes for our checked bags. These delays caused us to miss our connection on Nokair to Phuket which amounted to flushing about 4000 baht down the toilet as we had to buy new tickets and wait another hour. Thai Lion Air does not care about customer service.

### "very cramped legroom"
Bangkok to Phuket. First of all, good to have a new A330 on this short route. However very cramped legroom, 1.5 hours delay after a previous 2 hour time change a couple of weeks before. Crew looked confused, no food or drinks service. For what I paid it was just about OK. Do not book tight connections with this airline and always give yourself some wiggle room in case they change the schedule. Have to say the premium economy seats at the front looked great but for a short flight I wouldn't bother. Dont ever think you will get any compensation in Asia for flight delays. Thank goodness we have in the EU that offers us some protection as travellers and not be at the mercy of an airline that want to play about with you.

### "scattered in flight"
Mumbai to Bangkok. Accepted that its a Economy flight but cabin crew did not offer free water you have to purchase in flight with high rate. They dont allow outside dry food to eat in flight. In return journey from Bangkok to Mumbai; during check-in they allocated me seat at time of boarding the seat number they changed. Family members get scattered in flight and lot of confusion in flight which delay the flight take-off for 35-40 minutes.

### "legs pushing against the seat"
Chiang Mai to Bangkok. This airline is terrible. I am 180 cm and I asked the people at the check in if I could get a emergency exit seat because my legs push against the other seat they said to inform the flight attendance. When I got onto the flight I told them that my legs are pushing against the seat. I asked because all the seats were free on that row. They said they cannot do that. Never flying with this airline again.

### "worst airline I have ever taken"
Bangkok to Phuket. This was hands down the worst airline I have ever taken. I booked my flight on Expedia, and i have a bone to pick with them about this as well. The baggage allowance says 1st checked baggage no fee. When we arrived to check in at the counter my wife and I had one suit case each. The check-in counter surprised us with a 10kg weight limit. My booking, ticket, and Expedia web site made no mention of this ridiculous weight limit. Our tickets cost us 5,000 Thai baht. They wanted to charge us and additional 5,000 baht for every leg of the trip, which would triple our trip cost. We arrived 2 hours early for the flight, and they were letting people skip the line for an earlier flight leaving only one agent to check in our flight. As time went by we were going to be late for and possibly miss our flight. We asked to speak to a supervisor they rudely said they don't have supervisors. And that if we were later than 45 minutes we would be removed from the flight. By the time we made it to the counter another 3 agents miraculously showed up to check everybody in. Then they surprised us with the weight limit. Again we asked for a supervisor, and again we were denied. I asked the agent what to do she said pay, but by that time there was no time left to go pay and come back, and that we would miss our flight. I have never seen such an unprofessional airline. I would never ever fly them again, and I highly recommend you don't either.

### "the heat was turned up"
Hangzhou to Bangkok. This was my first time taking this airline. Check in efficient, seat, entertainment and service was great, snacks/food on par! After food service, lights were turned down, (as it was a red-eye) and the heat was turned up more then any of my flights ever before - I was so hot, I was mad. Ive flown some warm Asian carriers before but this one took the cake.

### "don´t fly with this airline"
Hanoi to Bangkok. Just don´t fly with this airline. The time of my flight from Hanoi to Bangkok was changed without any notice to me. They told me, they tried to reach me. But didn´t. No e-Mail, no phone call. Nothing. The staff at the airport is just smiling at you, blaming it on the travel agency, which mentioned in their terms and conditions that only the airline is responsible to notify me in case of any changes. Furthermore there is no compensation offered, no food or drinks at the airport for 10 hours waiting time. Just an average, unreal smile towards me saying they can´t help me.

### "hottest flight I ever had"
Bangkok to Hat Yai. The positives were smooth boarding, on-time departure and generous legroom. A minor annoyance is the need to actually print out the web-check-in boarding pass, they don't accept digital boarding passes. The real discomfort however was the lack of aircon. I don't know if it was broken or just turned off for saving purposes, anyway it was the hottest flight I ever had. There was ventilation but it only recycled hot air. The temperature became more bearable as we reached cruising altitude but upon landing the Thai summer struck back. No free food or water, snacks available for purchase.

### "worst airline experience"
Phuket to Bangkok. We bought our tickets on a travel website not really checking with what airline we would have to deal - that might have been a mistake. Thai Lion Air has this policy where you need to pay for extra luggage weight 4 hours prior to your flight. And if it’s a domestic flight you can only carry 10kg under the airplane. We didn’t get that in our two way ticket (it wasn’t explained clearly but still took the blame for it). We had to pay over 300$ CAN for our extra weight penality because we had 2 luggages weighing a little under 20kg (which is the norm for most airplane companies). So 4-5 days before our next flight departure, I called them to know how exactly I can pay for extra weight. They told me I can’t pay over the phone because they don’t take credit cards from Canada, United States, Japan and a few other countries over the phone. So they told me to pay via internet or come 4 hours prior to my flight at the airport to pay. Keep in mind that they know I’m leaving at 8 am. So first I try via internet with their website to pay for my extra luggages weight - it would deny my credit card payments. I tried at least 6 times during 3 days and it just would not work. So we were forced to go 4 hours earlier to the airport. Our flight was at 8 am so we had to get to the airport at least 5 hours ealier to get a chance to pay for our luggages. When we got there around 3 am the gates were not opened and I had to get to another terminal to get help from their office. When I got there the staff was not able to help me with anything and just repeated what was written on the internet like a robot. I asked if I could talk to a supervisor or if there where someone I could call and they gave me the same number I called at first. I finally found a pay phone on my own, called the airline, just to find out that I had to go back to the same terminal I was first to find the cargo department for help. When I got back to my terminal I found out the cargo departement was in another terminal 10 min walk away from my terminal. I asked the info center to call the cargo departement to see if they could actually help me. Cargo Departement told me that the airline had to help me and to call them back. I was so frustrated to lose hours of sleep to be played like that. Got on the phone with airline again and told them they had to make it work because this was nonsense. They told me they could not help and kept telling me to contact the Cargo Department, again. I hung up and waited 1 hour in front of the terminal for an agent to finally let our luggages pass without paying but with the worst attitude ever. Worst airline experience ever 2/10 just for letting us pass without paying for extra luggages and I’m being generous.

### "Everyone sweltering hot and uncomfortable"
Flew Thai Lion Air from Bangkok to Chiang Mai. I was waiting in the plane for 60 minutes in Bangkok with no air conditioning during the highest heat of the day in Bangkok. Everyone overheating but staff refusing to put on the A/C. Everyone sweltering hot and uncomfortable. Not happy with the service on this airline.

### "Avoid to use this airline"
Bangkok to Denpasar. Avoid to use this airline. when arrived at the airport was told that flight was canceled (several months ago!). when asked them what to do got reply that they will refund the tickets - ok, but what about taxi, hotel, left baggage service, transaction fee, etcv- nothing. Iexplained that we have booked/prepaid hotel in Denpasar they replied its not their business,  there was no sign of any help from them, haven't offered another flight, haven't tried to do anything. Just replied that they will proceed my request for refund within 45 business days. That was several months after cancelation, so they should proceeded anyway before already. but thats their policy. They filled some piece of paper barely looking like an official form and have problems to put in their info, stamp, name etc at the end, we just walked away and booked with another airline for more than 2x more money to avoid more losses for next taxi, hotels etc.

### "Customer service line is unreachable"
To make your journey comfortable, we strongly advise you to avoid Thai Lion Air! They cancelled our flights (both Bangkok to Phuket and return), just gave us a new timing that did not fit our needs due to renting a car, accommodation etc. Now they are avoiding our e-mails! Customer service line is unreachable (called from Europe twice and waited 20+ min. without answer). Not recommended.

### "Avoid at all costs"
Bangkok to Phuket. Avoid at all costs. The tickets are cheap and that is why the service and everything about this airline is cheap as well. I waited online for over an hour to check in on the no baggage check line. What makes it worse is they kept calling groups of passengers to jump the line because their flight was leaving soon. I guess getting there on time is not suggested because if you do you will wait over an hour, but if you arrive late they will just let you cut everybody. I then get on the flight and we were suppose to leave at 2:55pm, but they continued boarding passengers for almost an hour after take off time. Then an hour and 15 minutes after take off time they tell us we will be another at least 15 minutes because there are 5 planes ahead of us. If you don’t mind terrible service, delayed flights, packed with passengers who will arrive late and hold up the flight then by all means fly Thai Lion Air. In return the only benefit is the tickets are cheap.

### "never fly this airline again"
Denpasar to Bangkok. Very disappointed with extra baggage charges at Denpasar airport. The Thai Lion website and the staff I spoke to at Bangkok stated $32 for 10kgs, but the staff at the airport tried to charge me $160. I got rid of 7 kgs and was charged $66 for a lousy 3 kgs. I feel very ripped of by the Thai Lion staff at Bali airport. They refused to call head office and said they could not do anything. They would not budge at all. Will never fly this airline again.

### "do all I can to avoid them"
Bangkok to Yangon. I use this Thai Lion Air 2 to 6 times per month and I am regularly satisfied with their service. Nevertheless, I had in few occasions in the past and particularly this months a terrible one, from various services. I tried the evening before the morning flight to purchase some additional kilos of luggage. Firstly through the phone. I stayed in 2 occasions more than 15 minutes on line waiting for an operator to reply. Hopeless. Then I tried on the website, which specify this possibility to buy extra luggage until 4hours before the flight. Spend 30 minutes navigating and it seems that there is actually no possibility to book luggage online. I arrived at airport 2h00 before the flight so I would have enough time to explain my case to Sales counter in Don Muang Airport. Basically told me that instead of paying 700 baht for 10 kg luggage (bought in advance), I would need to pay 500 baht ++ per kilos (total 5600 baht). They have been unhelpful, even rude, including before I would submit my request no greeting, so smile, no engagement. Terrible. The manager and 2 staff were not trying to help and did not care that their phone service and website was dysfunctional. I asked to speak to a real manager of customer serice director and they would decline. As they are not trained for this type of issues and complain resolution, neither have power to act, they called the security as I did not wanted to leave without resolution. To be noted that the Thai Lion security agent was a gentleman and tried to help. He even told me that this type of cases are happening often and that he felt sorry for me. I went to proceed to check-in and explained my case. The ground staff agent was also very unpleasant (no greeting, no smile, no attention) even before I exposed the issue. She then listened and asked her supervisor to come. She directly said that she was not ready to help (what kind of manager in an airline does not have better training and skills in issue resolution?). After arguing for 15 minutes she told me I would pay only for half even I explained again that it was still very unfair that I was not able to buy the extra luggage before because their customer care services are not functioning. She could only say I cannot help you and just complain online. Also could not give the name and contact of a real manager. I did pay and proceeded to boarding. After flight, I received a satisfaction questionnaire, which I immediately filled adding a comment to ask for a Customer relations manager to contact me back. 48 hours later, nothing happened. To be noted that flights are usually comfortable with actually very professional stewards and hostesses. Most of the time departure are on time, all of this with really good deals. Such a shame that their sales and ground services are disorganised, dishonest and not trained. Will do all I can to avoid them.

### "pleasant, no delays or cancelations"
Chiang Mai to Bangkok. The flight was pleasant, no delays or cancelations, decent food as well. The only qualm I have is that Thai Lion Air is that when booking my flights through a 3rd party (expedia, momondo, etc.) Thai Lion Air's website won't allow me to see my booking at all, manage it, anything. I've booked all my flights through 3rd party websites and haven't had an issue like that before.

### "Return as good as the first one"
Bangkok to Chiang Rai. Return trip as good as the first one. Both legs on time and bags on the belt before us. Again the only issue is the impossibility of check in through your final destination. Leg room is very tight but fine for an hour flight, I am 1.60 so I normally fit well in any airline seat. 15 kg checked bag is included in the price.

### "they include 15kg bag in the price"
Chiang Rai to Nakorn Si Thamarat via Bangkok and both flights were on time. Leg room is the tightest I've ever seen, but still ok for a 60 minute flight. No frills airline so don't expect anything free on board but they include a 15kg bag in the price. Our only issue with then was that you can't check your bags though even when connecting to a flight with the same airlane.

### "staff unfriendly and inexperienced"
Flew Bangkok to Khon Kaen with Thai Lion Air. Boarding started 5 minutes after we should have departed (despite the aircraft being on the stand for at least an hour), and was done in an unprofessional manner, announcements not being made by the PA system but by shouting at passengers and in Thai only. We departed 30 minutes late, with no explanation for delay. Staff seemed unfriendly and inexperienced especially the ground staff. During the flight, there was an announcement that cabin crew would be selling food and drinks and to refer to the menu in the seat pocket, but there was no menus in the seats. Then the attendants came down the aisle with the trolley very quickly and didn't seem to want to sell anything. Recorded announcements were confusing and not given at the right time, for example we were told we were starting our descent just 5 minutes before landing. The flight itself was fine, but the unprofessional attitude of this airline and inexperience of the staff doesn't inspire confidence. On the plus side they give a free 15kg bag allowance and free seat selection when checking in online and the flight was cheap.

### "seats are very tight"
Flight from Krabi to Bangkok delayed 1 hour and 40 minutes. Missed the next connection. Had to buy full price replacement ticket. No help from Thai Lion Air. Seats are very tight. Not designed for anyone over 175 cm. No complimentary onboard snack or drink, had to buy everything.

### "impressed with the airline"
I flew round trip from Ho Chi Minh City to Bangkok. The ground crew as well as cabin crew was wonderful, helpful, friendly and professional. The aircraft was clean and on time. I was impressed with the airline. Will definitely fly them again in the future. Only isue I had was the seat pitch was a little to narrow for tall people, but OK for shorter travellers.

### "great service and staff"
Bangkok to Phuket. I was really surprised with Thai Lion Air. I often fly with this airline many times due to luggage allowance and low fares. Never had any trouble during purchasing the tickets or the flight itself. This time I faced a different situation where my plans changed and I had to change the date of my ticket. At first I didn't even want to try to do that since it usually turns out to be a nightmare, I thought it would be easier just to purchase new tickets, however after I decided to give it a try and was actually very surprised by how easy it was. It took me only 3 minutes to change the date of the flight and pay for it. The call-center operator spoke good english. They even called me back after to remind to change the insurance date. Great airline with great service and staff!

### "disappointed apart from the cost"
Booked return flights from Bangkok to Krabi with Thai Lion Air and have to say was well disappointed apart from the cost. We were travelling with a 4 year old and had been delayed so bought some drinks in the airport. When we were boarding the flight we were told that we couldn't take the drinks on the plane - expected just to take a 4 year old and refuse him a drink.

### "cabin crew were especially caring"
Phuket to Bangkok with Thai Lion Air. Flight was operated by a new B737-900 which was really clean and very smart inside. The cabin crew were especially caring and moved me to row 1 on my own to give me more space. I also liked the free chocolate bar which I thought was a nice touch against an old sandwich. The onboard service and aircraft is better than Nokair or Airasia which I have flown before. However they are majorly let down by handling in both HKT airport and DMK airport. You do online checkin but have to still check in like everyone else as no bag drop available? And when you question this a glazed employee looks without any answer or explanation. Upon arrival in DMK we waited over 30 minutes for the first bag after the aircraft came onto blocks. This meant I nearly missed the free bus to BKK main airport. I would fly Thai lion again but feel they need to put the contracted handling company under some pressure to perform and also look at the online check-in policy and bag dropping facilities.

### "flights were both punctual"
I'm not sure why people talk about delays. My Thai Lion Air flights (Don Muang to Chiang Mai and return) were both punctual. DMK to CNX on early Friday morning SL500. First flight from DMK. Very early - 5.50am, but a great time to be in Chiang Mai. Arrived 7am. No delay. CNX to DMK on Sunday afternoon SL509. Same, no delay. Arrived DMK 2.15pm. No turbulence. Great view of the ground. Plane not flying very high. Best thing TLA is the cabin staff who were all very well groomed and highly skilled in providing a great service, even though the travel time was only 1 hour. Drinks were served together with biscuits. Didn't expect any food or drinks, since flight was only 1hr. But still this basic need was provided. Cheap to fly too. So if you are travelling domestic, consider Thai Lion Air. The only sticky issue is use of electronic gadgets. These days with mobile phones containing music and videos, it is an entertainment module all-in. Asking me (repeatedly) to switch off my phone during the flight was a big nag. Besides, there are other airlines already providing wifi services in the sky. As a frequent flyer on planes, as long as we respect the take-off and landing, no surf periods, all should be fine in the sky.

### "inefficient, non-communicative, unhelpful"
Chiang Mai to Phuket via Bangkok with Thai Lion Air. I have now taken 4 flights with Lion Air and 100% of these flights have been delayed which is most frustrating when connecting. With Thai Lion Air, you must go through customs, collect baggage and check in all over again for your connecting flight. Yesterday our first flight was delayed by 1h 35mins meaning we made it to the check in desk for flight 2 with only 4mins to spare. The airline also stated that despite the delays being their fault, should we not make our connection they would not put us on a later flight. We could buy one if we wanted. I won't be flying with Thai Lion Air again. Stressful, inefficient, non-communicative and simply unhelpful. Their one positive is you don't pay for checked baggage.

### "cabin crew were courteous"
I had never heard of Thai Lion Air before. The experience of flying from Bangkok to Phuket and back was as good as the best airlines on this route, and much cheaper. The check-in at both airports was very friendly, helpful, and efficient. The ground staff were very helpful in providing a seat suitable for my height. The seats were comfortable. (New planes.) The cabin crew on both flights were courteous and warm. On the flight from Phuket to Bangkok a passenger fell ill, the crew dealt with the many aspects of the situation very well indeed and in a very caring manner towards the passenger. There are 3 small points for improvement though: 1) Ground staff shouldn't be seen drinking anything at the Gate. It affects the professional image. (Phuket) 2) The return flight from Phuket to Bangkok left 55 minutes late. The staff at the Gate should have explained the reason why (even if it was most probably because of the bad weather) and the Captain should also have explained why the plane took ages to take off, and apologized for the 55-minute overall delay. The reason was obvious, but he should have explained why. If you want food, you can buy it. Not having to pay for luggage was welcome, and was the main reason for not flying with Air Asia.

### "they improved the service"
Phuket to Bangkok on 5 May, and tried for second time the add on Fast Service of Thai Lion Air. They improved the service. My compliments to the ground and in flight staff. Brand new aircraft, clean and pre booked meal was fresh. Fast personal check in, priority boarding with VIP mini bus, left first the aircraft and received my luggage from a ground staff upon arrived at the belt. The best domestic flight I have had. To improve the possibility to buy the fast service from the web site also.

### "pre-booked meal deliciously fresh"
Service was satisfactory to a certain level but lots of improvements need to be made. 10 April - Don Muang - Phuket flight 766. Last time I traveled with Lion Air I had paid an extra fee for the Lion Fast Service that offers exclusive check-in counter, priority boarding, seat on the first rows and priority claim bag. I would first like to compliment the staff of Lion Air office in Phuket Airport (second floor – I upgraded to Lion Fast with them). Very professional and polite and with a great smile. On the day of the flight I arrived at the airport an hour before departure and to my disappointment I found out there was no exclusive check-in counter for Lion Fast. I waited in line for around 25 minutes, when one of their staff members asked the passengers waiting if there was anyone that was flying to Phuket. I replied and she asked why I came so late. I replied that I had the Lion fast upgrade and I was expecting to be checked-in at the Lion fast counter. The only answer I received was a smile but 10 minutes later I was at the gate as they did their best to check me in for the flight as fast as they could. During boarding time and as I was preparing myself to hear the announcement for Lion Fast priority boarding, I heard “please proceed for boarding rows 24 to 36 first”. To my disappointment there was no priority boarding. The two flight attendants on board were very professional. The pre-booked meal was deliciously fresh and one of the best I have tasted. When I arrived at Phuket Airport, I was finally given priority to leave the aircraft and to my big surprise the ground staff were waiting for me (before the claim area) and gave me my luggage. From the gate to the exit of the airport it took me only 5 minutes. According to my experience they are selling a fairly good product at a competitive price. They are trying to make improvements but in small steps. I would give 3 stars to the airport and gate staff and 1 to the Bangkok staff although it is clear that the lack of fast check in of fast boarding is not their responsibility. I would give 5 stars to the Phuket staff. I hope Lion Air will consider introducing a frequent flyer program soon. All the rest: navigation of web site, special services, extra payments with credit cards need a lot of improvement.

### "generally enjoyed the flight"
Singapore to Bangkok DMK. Surprisingly pleasant experience with low-cost airline, Thai Lion Air. The aircraft was new, service crew aboard was friendly and helpful. Unlike other low-cost airlines in the region, this one has a baggage allowance and get you a small snack/water (unnecessary in my case but nevertheless a pleasant move). A slight delay on departure wasn't a major thing, I generally enjoyed the flight with them.

### "acceptable to fly short haul"
Bangkok to Chiang Mai. Thai Lion Air is an acceptable airline to fly short haul. I tried to purchase a few extra options via website but not successful. Call Center is very difficult to reach and processing those requests cost a lot more money, so I give up. When onboard, I tried to buy a hot meal but was explained that one will be sold on flight longer than 2 hours only (not mentioned in their website). I think they still have minor problem to work on, but at least the flight are on time. Service at airport and in the air are good.

### "frustrating experience"
Thai Lion Air flight change/cancellation is disgusting. I booked a flight from Bangkok to Krabi for the 29th February, and realized soon after I had made a mistake, and needed a flight for a day later. Fair, I made a mistake, and would expect there to be some form of charge to do this. However they told me that in order to make a change I would have to pay 750 THB per person, and that I couldn't make this payment on anything except a Thai or Singapore credit card. I basically paid this amount for the flight to begin with, so essentially would have had to pay for another ticket all together, even though I was making this change more than a month in advance. Beyond that, when I had paid for the tickets on a Canadian credit card, they were telling me I could not make this from Canada now, and would have to do it in Thailand by the 4th if I wanted to change this, when I wouldn't even be arriving until the 29th. When I asked them to cancel the flight, and that I would just rebook through them, they offered me only 200 THB back in total, which was basically the equivalent to $7-8 Canadian when the flight cost me $73. Again, a month in advance notice - just bought the tickets days before. Very frustrating experience.

### " never use this airline again"
First Thai Lion Air flight was delayed 4 hours (for a 1 hour flight might add). Out of fear that my return flight would be delayed (I had an onward flight only 1 hour after it), I used the call center to change the flight. On hold on and off for nearly 25 minutes. I requested a change in flight free of charge, as a courtesy for the 4 hour delay of the first flight. No customer service at all. When they refused, I agreed to pay the fee for changing and in the end, she said I could not change it because I needed a Singaporean credit card. Complete waste of 30 minutes with the call center. The woman said to go to the airport early and I could change/pay then. Arriving at the airport 3 hours early, 1. they also wouldn't change the flight free of charge and 2. flight could only be changed up until 4 hours before the flight, which the call center did not tell me. The woman was rude and useless, "we are a budget airline" - so I guess this means no customer service! On the spot, I booked with Air Asia. Will never use this airline again. If you're travelling in Thailand, there are plenty of budget airlines.

### "value for money fare"
Managed to book tickets with Thai Lion at a cheaper price compared to other budget airlines. Moreover it has a generous 20kg free baggage allowance and free seat selection. Plane is new, and the seat pitch on its Boeing 737-800 is wider than its Boeing 737-900ER, thus it's quite a comfortable 2 hours flight. Free snacks in the form of biscuits and small drinking water. The meals on sale is not too expensive either. Cabin staff are generally friendly. Return flight in the late afternoon was delayed, a common problem for all budget airline. Recommended for the short flight, baggage allowance with no extra charges, and it's value for money fare.

### Thai Lion Air customer review
Phuket to Bangkok. Thai Lion Air is a low cost carrier and that this is not based on a single flight, but multiple flights on Thai Lion Air. They have a free and generous luggage allowance, the aircraft are new and clean, they give a small water and a snack on all flights, seats are slightly wider than a normal LCC. Now the bad news - they might have least amount of leg room of any airline I've flown, at 5'11" sitting upright my knees are pressed hard on the back of the seat in front of me. I'm not sure what the issue is but they always fly their planes very warm. The staff working the flights though attractive seem somewhat cold and indifferent - it's not the warm Asian service you come to expect.

### "missed connecting flight"
Singapore to ChiangMai via Bangkok. I have a connecting flight from Bangkok to Chiang Mai, however the delay of flight from Singapore to Bangkok and delay in baggage arrival has caused me to missed my connecting flight. There was zero follow through service on the ground by Thai Lion Air crew. Upon arrival at Don Mueang Airport, while waiting for our baggage at the conveyor belt, we informed one of Thai Lion Air ground staff about our situation. After the ground staff walkie talkie to her colleague at the check-in counter, we were then told to go to your check-in counter that is located so far away without any formal direction or guidance. When reached the counter, it was a massive chaos. We are already short of time – and yet we have to RE-CHECK IN our baggage and go through immigration and security checks. But none of Thai Lion Air staff actually follow through and provide any form of assistance. Eventually, we missed the connecting flight and have to reschedule to the next available flight which was 6.5 hours later. For me to reschedule the flight, I have to explain the situation multiple times to different Thai Lion Air crew in order for me to get the situation sorted out and have the admin charges waived. But they still charge me an additional SGD72 for the price difference. The total amount I paid for this terrible budget carrier is ridiculous. All in all, unless there are no other flights in the world, and desperate to fly out, then Thai Lion Air can be the choice.

### "friendly air crew"
Thai Lion Air boasts about wider seats, difficult to visualize as the cabin of the 737-900 is not significantly different from that of other 737 models. Otherwise, uneventful flights between Bangkok Don Mueang and Chiang Rai (both directions): on time, friendly air crew, small snack (3 Orea biscuits) and a glass of water, new aircraft, very clean. No particular advantage in comparison to Nok Air but better than Air Asia who charge for using wheelchairs on some flights.

### "I cannot fault them"
A 90 minute flight with Thai Lion Air from Bangkok to Krabi and back in November/December 2015. I cannot fault them, pleasant staff, a drink and snack included. Efficient check in and boarding. A very cheap flight but not at the expense of quality or customer service. Seats a little cramped but ok for a shirt flight. A welcome change after a terrible experience with Air China. I would use this airline again.

### "ticket was not expensive"
Thai Lion Air is new low cost airline in Thailand. I flew domestic from Hatyai to Bangkok, the staff was quite friendly. Onboard everyone got their seat but the crew announced to wait some important document for 15 minutes. The seat pitch is so small on Boeing 737-900, there are 215 seats. The crew gave some snack that was resonable for low cost. The ticket was not expensive including free snack and 15 kgs for checked bag.

### "definitely use them again"
I am surprised that Thai Lion Air is a low cost airline. With the low price, you have a free checked luggage, free seat selection and even a snack on board. All flights were on time and definitely will use them again.

### "I couldn't say a bad word about it"
Brand new Thai Lion Air plane, very clean, would say it was half empty, on time flight. I couldn't say a bad word about it, as it is cheaper than AirAsia and offers much more in my opinion. Nice and smiley staff, smooth check in. Would recommend it.

### Thai Lion Air customer review
CNX-BKK on Thai Lion Air 737-900er. Not impressed with their check in agent who utter only necessary word, feeling completely ignored but at least all requests are tended to. Airside people seemed to be much better. Gate agents are helpful, cabin crew are also nice and efficient. Aircraft is in Boeing Sky Interior, very clean and new, but seat pitch is the worst I have ever seen. I shall be fine flying them domestically, but would never consider them for journey longer than 1.5 hours.
