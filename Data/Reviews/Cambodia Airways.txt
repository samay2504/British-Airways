### "not check in until 2.5 hours before"
Good flight. Turbulence was handled well. Landing a bit quick and rough. Food service was on the ball, neither delicious or gross somewhere I'm the middle. Stewardesses were polite. Bathroom clean. Unfortunately no entertainment system or phone charging outlet. At the check in at Singapore I could not check in until 2.5 hours before the flight and there was no online check-in available due to the agency booking.

### “I should have known better”
This is the worst company ever. They cancelled my flight 2 days before it was due which left me with having to book a more expensive flight and also losing money on pre-booked accommodations. After reading the reviews on this company, I realised that cancelling flights with very little notice is a common practice of the company. I should have known better. Avoid booking a flights with this company if you don't want to incur in a cancellation and late refund.

### “Worst experience of personnel”
Worst experience of personnel I’ve ever had. Two members of the check-in staff (including the supervisor) even laughed at me when I couldn’t board the plane with my emergency passport. Terrible airline and terrible airport.

### "definitely use the airline again"
Not that much leg room. If you are over 180cm tall, you will be bashing your kneecaps, but otherwise, the seat is pretty comfortable. The services from the cabin crew were friendly and efficient. Due to Covid restrictions, no snack was served on this flight. There is no screen in the seats, so you must supply your own inflight entertainment. Would definitely use the airline again, as their routes are handy and they were punctual.

### "please do not book with them!"
Siem Reap to Sihanoukville. They cancelled our flights due to “commercial” reasons and then when they offered to refund us money we never received it. Been 2 weeks and I have emailed them when the money will be back in my account. We feel so scammed and upset please please do not book with them!
