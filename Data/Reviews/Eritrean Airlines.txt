### Eritrean Airlines customer review
FCO-FRA-CAI-ASM in C return ASM-KRT-FCO in Y. Both flights full and operated on Airbus A319 wet leased from BH Air. Seats comfortable and legroom generous. FA's professional and efficient yet quite reserved and rarely smiled. The food quality in general was rather average on the outbound leg offered 3 meals which were tasty and rather filling. On the 6 hour inbound trip offered a small and just edible breakfast option. Slightly limited beverage options. The intermediate fuel stops in FRA and CAI make the flight seem incredibly long and aren't specified on your ticket. Both flights delayed outbound 40 mins inbound 8 hours - no explanation given. Luggage allowance is generous yet only 2kg more for Business passengers (48kg). Customer service at Asmara Airport has improved yet the Terminal is small and old and needs renovations no Business Class lounge available. No IFE or reading material offered on board B8 flights.

FCO-ASM in Economy. Cabin comfortable spacious ample legroom grey leather seats on new A320 FA's kind and polite. Return flight AMS-FCO via CAI same aircraft on time departure yet our arrival was delayed by 50 mins due to unscheduled fuel stop in CAI. Airport services in ASM have gradually improved onboard meals were edible on both legs and were the same for Y and J class. Both flights were nearly empty only 20% load no IFE.

Had about two hours delay in Dubai for my flight to Asmara. This was a straight flight without a stop in Dijbouti normally done. Eritrean Airlines are good in cancelling your reservation it happened on both flights to and from Dubai. Staff friendly drinks and food basic. Seats looks rather old with damaged fabric.

DXB-ASM-DXB 4 times now. Each time the flight is supposed to be fully booked no matter how much in advance you book. And invariably seats are confirmed 24hrs before the flight. Inside there are always about 25% empty seats. Once they said "fully booked" for 4 days then 24hrs before confirmed the seat. Then later rescheduled the flight by 24hrs - then cancelled it. Food is rather average though cabin crew is friendly. Once Business class has 3 seats a side. No special food for Business class.

Frankfurt (Main) to Asmara. The crew are most friendly. The onboard service was excellent and standard of the aircraft was good though the legroom wasn't great. The ground handling done by the airline at Asmara International Airport was efficient even though there were a number of shortcomings at the airport the airline got round them. The price of the ticket was worth the service I received.
