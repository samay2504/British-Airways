### "had to pay for the boarding passes"
Our flight was rescheduled twice and when we arrived at the airport it was not on the board, we had to ask info desk about gate and check in. Then realized the online ticked they generate for you is not a boarding pass. We had to pay for the boarding passes. So we had to queue to pay the fee and then come back to get boarding passes. The skyup lady who was checking in people was not helpful. We then had to get them from a completely different skyup flight and the only reason we managed to make it was because they were super late.

### "the worst airline I have ever coame across!"
Not Verified |  By far the worst airline I have ever come across! Our flight got 6 hours late, for a one hour flight trip! The staff were very unprofessional. Its not like we paid a little amount, we paid 350$ for one hour flight and I would definitely pay twice more just to avoid ever using this airline.

### "an interesting airline"
SkyUp is definitely an interesting airline. Going into this trip, I was not really sure what to expect from a low cost airline that tends to receive high ratings. We had booked second row seats for 15 dollars each. My original seat, which was located on the left side of the aircraft (A-B-C), did not have the extra legroom that was promised. However, since the flight was mostly empty, I was able to move to the right side of the aircraft, seats (D-E-F). These rows had substantially more seatpitch and could definitely be compared to that of other airlines premium economy. As for the seats themselves, they were quite thin and similar in shape to that of spirit airlines or easyjet, but, nonetheless, it still had a great recline angle. In terms of service itself, the airline does not have any food or drinks besides water on flights to or from any city but Kyiv, so beware, and plan to bring your own food onboard. There was no in flight magazine or wifi, only a QR code for you to download an online journal before takeoff. The aircraft landed on time, and overall, it was a smooth flight.
