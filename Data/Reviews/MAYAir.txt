### "worst customer service"
MAYAir is the worst airline when it comes to customer service. My flight was delayed from Fort Lauderdale to Cancun and was in constant contact with MAYAir to ensure them that I would be on time for the flight. I landed and rushed to the terminal where they fly from. Their shuttle bus took over 10 mins to arrive and therefore missed the flight to Cozumel. I arrived exactly at the time of departure and was assured by multiple MAYAir employees at the terminal that MAYAir had been told I was on my way and assured me i was able to get on the plane. When I arrived they all pretended not to know what I was talking about and therefore charged me a fee to get on the next flight. No apologies were given, no tolerance, no customer service, and because its sunday, no one to officially complain to. Aparently the supervisor had gone home. This is the second time this has happened to me. Another disturbing fact is that they charge a very high exchange rate for people paying excess luggage at $10 mexican pesos for every $1usd.
