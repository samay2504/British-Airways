### "I missed all connecting flights"
Not Verified |  Our flight time was changed from 08.50am to 6pm! I missed all connecting flights, had to pay for another hotel in Abuja and was stuck in limbo. I had already checked out of the hotel. The flight change wasn't communicated and we only discovered when we got to the airport.

### "Terrible service delivery"
Worst airline in Nigeria. Terrible service delivery. Insincere, bossy and lying customer service agents. Difficult to keep to schedule. Quarrelsome personnel from customer service to Air hostess.

### "a blatant disregard for welfare"
Not Verified |  I am quite accommodating as a person and I have clear understanding of flight logistics challenges. But Arik Air showcased a complete lack of class and a blatant disregard for welfare. It’s disgraceful and outright incompetent. I arrived 55 minutes before flight time and I was unable to check in to get a boarding pass and thus forced to reschedule and it’s particularly painful because I had promised my three year old that I’d be with her. And they were so rude despite my calm demeanor. I’m not one to give bad reviews or reviews in general but here you go. I’d fly Max or Airpeace going forward and I employ others to do the same.

### "such careless behaviour is unacceptable"
Not Verified |  The shuttle bus dropped us the passengers at the hanger! The flight from Lagos to Port Harcourt was scheduled at 3pm then rescheduled to 6pm, then again moved to 8.30 and I'm writing this as I board the flight at 9.31 pm. The bus driver who picked us up at mm2 boarding gate dropped us at the hanger and then left stating he has to go home. Serious action should be taken against such irresponsible employees and the airline should be charged a penalty for such negligence while recruiting junior staff. It is not even funny how close we were to another aircraft which was so loud that we had to close our ears. Delay for Arik isn't uncommon but such careless behaviour is unacceptable. I won't be travelling this airline ever again. Apart from no communication for the delay the airline is as worst as it can get in the aviation industry. They have set a new low for themselves.

### "not changed for better regarding refunds"
Not Verified |  I booked Arik flight from Lagos to Port Harcourt on February 11, 2020 to travel on February 12, 2020 using my GTbank Master Card .The payment was done on Quickteller and it showed that the transaction was successful and my account was debited accordingly. Unfortunately when I got to the airport on February 12,  I was informed at the counter that my booking was not successful and was referred to the payment section. At the payment section I was asked to contact my banker for refund which I did but I was informed by my bank that the error is from Arik. As side the fact that I missed my flight, I have also been made to suffer unduly for the negligence of your organization. I have tried to call your Account Refund line severally but no luck. I lodged the complaint with my bank which in turn contacted Keystone Bank and the bank confirmed that the payment was successful. I also took efforts to visit arik air's office, sent mail but all to no avail. It's quite unfortunate that the airline has not changed for better regarding refunds.

### "Awfully disappointing"
Not Verified |  Lagos to Warri. Terrible. Last seat available was a business class seat at 70k Naira. 30k more than economy class and the same narrow horrible chairs as economy. In fact no difference between classes to justify any price difference on this aircraft. Awfully disappointing.

### "inefficient and best avoided"
Not Verified | Lagos to Accra. From my experience today at Arik Air, I can describe the airline as being terribly inefficient and best avoided. The flight was delayed first for 2 hours with excuses of the plane developing a fault. Later, a staff came to tell us after 2 hours that the plane was now on ground and they were running some checks on it. After another 45 mins another staff came to tell us that actually the plane has not yet landed and they will give us an update in about 20 minutes time. No one is telling us anything and so we do not know whether we will still travel tonight or not. On informing someone about my predicament I was told I made a mistake by buying an Arik Air ticket, that this is their usual practice. I would not advise anyone to travel with this airline.

### "the worst business class in Africa"
Without any doubt the worst business class in Africa. Everything was wrong. Even with a most expensive business class ticket, I was requested to be at the very small and terribly mediocre Freetown airport 2 hours ahead of the flight: when one knows how few flights there are per day, ridiculous. When I checked in I was guaranteed that the flight had taken off from Accra where it came from and was due on time in Freetown, when I checked later with the crew, I found out it was a total lie as the flight was delayed and it was still on the ground at that time. When I checked in, I also asked about the business lounge and was told that of course I could use it, but after immigration I discovered it had been closed and remained closed for the 3 hours I waited: one of the shopkeepers nearby told me that the staff looking after the lounge had left because "they had other things to do". So I had to wait on the most uncomfortable metal bench with no air conditioning for 3 hours, nothing else was available. We received no information about the delay and no Arik Air staff were visible after the check-in counter. At 1am, the boarding was done in a most unprofessional way even for this continent where I have been some 3 or 400 times. Exhausted, I'm not very young to say the least, by this horrible experience on the ground I thought I would have 1.5 agreeable hours specially being the only passenger in business class. This was wrong, very wrong. I was first requested to stop using my iPad as Arik seems to be the only airline (with SAA) forbidding the use of an iPad during takeoff and landing. I asked for a glass of wine and was offered a choice between 2 tiny plastic bottles of lukewarm undrinkable wines. Beer was also lukewarm. The dinner consisted of 2 sandwiches, worse than what a low cost airline would offer. The crew was about as nice as their fellow citizens the immigration officers at Lagos airport. Horrible experience at a cost of nearly 700 USD one way for 900 miles. A rip-off would be an understatement.

### "avoid at all cost"
Accra to Monrovia. This is a terrible airline. Avoid at all cost. They sent us a message saying we should be there no later than 6am the evening before. We arrived and informed they knew something was wrong with the flight, but they just forgot to update the system. So our flight will now depart at 10:50am. We asked if we could leave and they can send a message when they are ready. They said we should wait. At 9am, we proceeded to check in and was informed now the flight is not leaving till 2pm. We again asked what the issue is, this time they said we don't have a plane. Most airlines on schedule were on time or with even a 20 mins delay, an annoucement was made. Nothing is annouced from this airline, you have to go and search for a representative, hide and seek game. No one really knows whats happening. One employee has advised us to head home, thus will proceed to leave.

### "had absolutely no interest in my case"
My colleague and I were booked on an Arik Air flight from Lagos to Warri, supposed to depart at 07.40 in the morning. I received a message two days prior to the flight, informing me that "due to operational requirements" the flight will operate at 11.00. The morning of the flight, I received another message informing me that again "due to operational requirements" the flight will operate at 12.00. Once at the airport, waiting to board, we were informed the flight was delayed 20 minutes. Twenty minutes came and went and we eventually boarded and only took off at 13.00, arriving in Warri by 14.00, only getting to the hospital where we were to have 2 full days of work at 15.30. An entire day wasted by an incompetent airline. It does however get worse, it is now 2 days later and we are supposed to fly from Warri to Lagos, booked on the 09.20 flight. We have a connecting flight to Accra, Ghana at 17.10, so plenty of time to make this connection. Or so you think. I received a message from Arik 2 days ago informing me that "due to operational" requirements, the flight will now operate at 12.40. I'm still not too worried, as we will still make the connection. Don't hold your breath. I received another message from Arik this morning at 09.38 informing me that even this amended time has now changed to 16.40. So, to summarize - a flight supposed to have left at 09.20 has now been delayed and yet again delayed to 16.40. I phoned the Arik Air call centre, explained that I will now miss my connection to Ghana. She had absolutely no interest in my case, no offer of assistance. Her single line was "Arik apologises". I would not recommend this airline to anyone - despite selling tickets at certain times, they have clearly no intention of sticking to any schedule, making up flying times as it suits their "operational requirements". There is nothing positive I can say about this airline.

### "the worst trip we ever had"
I booked the earliest flight of the day out of Uyo to Lagos. I had a connecting evening flight to Frankfurt at 22.45. Our Arik flight was scheduled for 9.15 according to the ticket and so we were there at 08:00. The Lady at the check in desk immediately told us that this flight time has been moved to 12:00 a couple of days ago already and that we can check-in at 10.00, in another 2 hours. Excuse me, am I lost? I bought the ticket a day ago and so the flight time should have been adjusted on the ticket. We were so happy to leave Nigeria after a 8 month Long Job adventure that we took the delay with a tired smile. At 10.00 we checked in with the other passengers and sat till 12:00. At 12.30 it was announced that the flight will be another 45 min delayed. At 14:00 they announced flight postponed for another 2 hours. We obviously got nervous and looked into buying a ticket for the last remaining other Airline to fly out. But Arik air assured us that it will not be necessary and their flight already in the air on the way to us. This was a lie. At 16:00 they announced that the plane is now on the way and would land in 45 min. It landed 16.45 and with no further info from the ground staff we boarded. Once in the plane we were surprised to find it to be packed to the last seats. It turned out that another plane en-route to Port Harcourt is picking us up. With not much time left to catch our international flight in Lagos we headed off towards Port Harcourt. In PH it took time to unload and re-fuel and for new passengers to board. We looked at the time and it was after 18.30 when we started towards Lagos. We finally arrived in Lagos from where we had to travel to the international Airport and go through check-in and customs in rush hour. It was the worst trip we ever had and really working on our nerves. The Arik ground staff was rude and lied to us the whole day. A trip of one hour became 10 hours. Stranded at a lousy Airport. The Airline itself was an old Boeing 737. The aircon did not work througout the flight and we nearly fainted. Chairs were taped together and the seatbelt on my friends chair could not Close. I stongly suggest not to travel with Arik if you concerned about your health, safety and smooth travels.

### "Inflight service is limited"
Abuja to Lagos. Working in Nigeria for the past year I have flown Arik on numerous occasions between Abuja and Lagos and Kano. On the whole they delivered a pretty good service domestically by Nigerian standards but from about November last year they ran into serious cash flow issues due to the drop in the value of the Nigerian Naira. As a result flights became subject to regular cancellation and delay. In January the airlne was take over by the Nigerian Government and now has a much reduced service. Arik has a number of regional routes around West Africa which are well known for delays and cancellations. But the same applies to most other regional airlines. Asky is probably the best, owned by Ethiopian. They also fly (or did fly) to New York, London and Johannesburg but unless price is our only criteria, flying Arik long haul is an experience I wouldn't recommend. Inflight service is limited. Plans are old and tatty. Delays and cancellations frequent. Bags often never arrive.

### "trip and airline to forget"
This roundtrip from JFK to Lagos Nigeria was very bad. I had flown with ARIK air 5 years ago and was hugely disappointed with the experience this time around. My reason for flying with this airline was due to its direct flight with no layover, and the fact that I had flown with them in the past and had a good experience. This time it was shambolic. Leaving JFK, they boarded on time but we were stuck on the runway for almost an hour (I can understand it is not always the airline's fault) but the fact the flight attendant told us the in-flight entertainment would be turned on once we left the gate was kinda odd. Only to hear over the PA that the entertainment system was not working and this made every moment in the 10.5 hour flight feel frustrating for not being honest with us travelers. There was no entertainment on the return flight as well. The plane décor was less than desirable. Once you got past the business class section, the walkway carpet was in need of replacement as you could see the show and cart marks. One bathroom was non-functional and smelled unsanitary with the toilet seat broken off. I wasn't sure if the airline wasn't taking note of what needed to be fixed. The meals were nothing special. Since it was the same plane returning the above is ditto just that we left 2 hours later than we were scheduled from Lagos and they gave an excuse of being held for inspections which I didn't buy. This led to us landing on the tarmac in JFK since they lost their slot at the gates. Thus we had to be bussed to immigration and waited 1.5 hours to get our luggage. A trip and airline to forget. And there was no wi-fi.

### "have improved their services"
London Heathrow to Lagos. Arik Air impressed me as I wasn't expecting the quality of service from an African airline. They have improved their services, expanded routes and fleet. I booked online but had to select my seat so contacted them on the phone. Staff was accessible over the phone they confirmed my selection then and there..

### "will definitely exclude Arik Air"
I've got my ticket from Accra to Banjul on July 19. When I got to the airport on the evening of July 20 to check in, the Arik office there told me that my flight had been cancelled. There was absolutely no notification ahead of time! They later changed my flight time to the same one two days later, which made me change my business plan including the hotel reservation and the pick-up from the Banjul airport that night. Next day I asked my agent to go to their office again and she told that they refused five passengers from Accra just because the aircraft from Lagos was too small to contain more passengers. But why did they sell more tickets than the seats? It caused me a lot of trouble! Last time (in May) when I took the flight from Arik between Accra and Dakar, it delayed more that 3 hours! I will definitely exclude Arik from my business flight choice in West Africa from now on.

### "sat there for another 4 hrs"
By far one of the worst experiences I have had flying out of the country. They were supposed to take me from JFK to Lagos and then to Liberia, it almost seems impossible for them. After a 12 hours layover in New York, when it came time to board, they were late checking their passengers in and then when we got to gate we sat there for another 4 hrs before they told us to line up for boarding. We waited another hour and they proceed to tell us that the flight was going to be delayed for an hour, 45 mins later we were told they were having technical issues that could last for hours. If you ever going to west Africa, Arik Air is not the airline.

### "absolutely no communication"
Flew Lagos to Dakar. I arrived at Lagos airport for my flight which was supposed to leave at 8.30pm but was delayed. The airline did not announce this delay, instead, I had to run around asking airport staff for information and thanks to a nice gentleman I finally found out the the plane was delayed 4 hours. 4 hours wait for a 3 hour flight. After waiting 4 hours the plane was further delayed an hour and once we boarded, we had to wait another hour and a half until it took off. All this time there was absolutely no communication from the airline, we were just expected to wait in ignorance. In the end I arrived in Dakar at 6am instead of 12am as scheduled. I will never recommend flying Arik Air.

### "shabby and unprofessional"
Our Arik Air flight from Lagos to London was originally supposed to depart at 12.55. After checking in, we we told that there would be a delay of about an hour. Just after about an hour and a few minutes, a lady came to update us telling us that there would be further delays and she didn't really know when we would be leaving. There was a lot of commotion and anger from the passengers at which she promised to do her best and while we waited we would be offered some refreshment (which never came!). About 30 mins later we were told we could board the plane. We were quite bemused as we all knew that they only boarded us that quickly to get out of the promise to give us refreshments as they should have. We all settled into our seats and sat there for another 1.5hrs with no explanations from anyone as to why there was still a delay. Passengers became agitated, angry and very upset. We eventually left Lagos at 4pm and got to London around 9pm. The treatment of passengers on the flight was shabby and unprofessional to say the least, and I will never recommend Ark to anyone.

### "couldn't be more helpful"
Left on time for short flight of about 50 minutes from Lagos to Accra. Offered breakfast (egg, sausage and baked beans) with drinks. All nice. Had to shovel it down quickly due to the short flight time. Terminal staff let us down with my freight baggage. Couldn't be more helpful.

### "forgot to load the meals"
Lagos to Abidjan with Arik Air. Bad, truly very bad. The plane was really dirty, I would say it had not been cleaned for days or weeks. Travelling in business class at dinner time I was told by the chief purser that he was sorry that catering forgot to load the meals and the drinks. And I was flying out from their hub! I travel all the time around Africa but this was really one of the worst services - or should I say no service.

### "things seem to be improving"
Arik Air flight from Lagos to London in economy class on A330. The inflight entertainment worked, although it is not dated. Seat was very comfortable, and the aircraft was nice and clean. Food was good but could have done with larger portions. I have flown with Arik in the past, and of late things seem to be improving.

### Arik Air customer review
No entertainment. Always late and don't care about the passengers. Have not flown the for a while because of bad service experiences in the past. Then they changed their flight schedule and it suited better time wise so I tried them again. 4 flight and 2 were delayed. Will now miss connection due to them as as expected they won't care. Food is really bad and the planes are falling to pieces on the inside. The last 4 flight has had seats with hand written notes out of order and the neck rests are not there, it's open metal rails and they are at the emergency exits.

### Arik Air customer review
London to Lagos - most of the inflight entertainment was not working. Made the journey very boring. The food was too salty and again most of the inflight entertainment were not working. 5th July 2015 my return journey back to London with Arik Air, the flight was delayed. Our flight was meant to depart Lagos at 12pm only to be told at 12:33 that the plane was been re-refuelled. After blankets were handed out, we were expecting the headsets to be handed out. Only to be told, due to a technical glitch, there would be no in-flight entertainment at all. The plane was also very dirty. Unbelievable in this time and age. I also noticed that their food portion is getting smaller.

### Arik Air customer review
W3 720 from Lagos to Abuja on 21 May 2015. W3 308 from Abuja to Accra on 21 May 2015. I am a regular ARIK passenger but have become frustrated beyond measure by the pathetic timekeeping and consistent delays experience with this airline. This morning we suffered an hour delay flying from Lagos to Abuja and tonight the Abuja to Accra flight is delayed by 2 hours thus far. Can the management of the airline not understand that people who fly are generally business people who need to be efficient and on time. Memorized standard apologies for inconvenience caused made by totally uninterested staff and flight commanders is not sufficient to cover the poor performance and failure to deliver.

### Arik Air customer review
I mostly travel with Arik Air and was never impressed. The flight from Lagos-London on 20/03/2015 was different as the inflight service was satisfactory but I noticed that the cabin crew were mostly foreigners and had a "HiFly" tag on. Arik should keep this standard and improve on it. The inflight entertainment was a sweet and bitter situation as some worked and some did not.

### Arik Air customer review
Flight from JFK to MMA. The check in staff were helpful and polite and we thought flying Arik would be a pleasant experience regardless of the bad reviews alas this was not the case. The security briefing was uninspiring to say the least an airline of Ariks size should really use a video people had to move their heads and practically get out of their seats to see what the crew member was doing and the person with the script had trouble with reading it. The inflight entertainment system didn't work and the staff didn't seem to care they were not apologetic or surprised it made me wonder when last it had worked. The staff were very unprofessional not courtesy in the way the addressed customers they didn't offer any extra drinks or snacks for the duration of the flight until they served breakfast. The food was unappealing and small in size. Overall Arik was a great disappointment and I will never fly them long haul again.

### Arik Air customer review
No airs or graces about Arik Air. My last trip from Lagos to Johannesburg was very bad firstly all passengers were waiting at the departure gate when a ground staff announced a delay because the flight staff i.e pilot and the crew were not at the airport yet. When they eventually arrived they asked us to give them some time to carry out their checks. Once onboard the customer service received was very poor. No headset provided for the entertainment system when I asked for the headset I was told they had none. Staff were very blasé about the whole situation no apology or even acknowledgement of the problems. On the return trip again the entertainment system was not working and no running water in the toilets. This is my 1st and last trip with Arik Air.

### Arik Air customer review
2 days ago I was in Lagos. There was already an 8 hour layover before I boarded this plane to JFK our boarding passes said we were to board at 9.30 pm and depart at 11.30 pm. 9.30 passed 10.30 passed. No updates as to why we were all sitting there not being attended to. A few minutes past 11 a female employee comes and tells a few people that our plane was indeed "faulty". Then she proceeds to say the next flight was not leaving until 10.30pm the following night. Some time went by and a male employee comes and gives us several different messages while on the phone being followed around by passengers he tells us the next flight will leave by 1.30 am long story short our original departure date of 11.30 pm turned out to actually be after 3 am. Bad customer service on the flight not organized in the airport - overall just a bad experience. I will not recommend Arik Air.

### Arik Air customer review
I recently flew business class from London to Lagos and then on to Asaba. I hadn't previously heard of Arik usually preferring BA. However the Arik price was more than half the BA price and also had the guaranteed connections from Lagos. The business class product is impressive - the beds are better than BA and the cabin feels a lot more spacious (including a bar where you can go to sit). The cabin crew were also very friendly. The internal flights were both delayed because of the weather - this was dealt with well by the Arik staff. Though the inflight entertainment is not too good and the customer service is not quite up to the BA / Virgin standard I was still impressed with Arik and would certainly fly with them again.

### Arik Air customer review
I waited in Port Harcourt airport for 10 hrs for a flight and we were never told a thing by Arik reps. The same I fly very frequently and I have not seen a worse airline. First you can't track the flights which wouldn't be so bad if there were any employees or a desk to find out what is going on but there isn't. In our case the flight was delayed 11 hrs. When we all showed up at the gate 11 hrs later our plane was no where to be seen and we waited with no information for another 2 hours. On our flight from NY to Lagos the planes air system was not switched on until we left the gate. The crew at least in my section did a good job to take care of us. On our flight from Lagos which was finally located and some crew from the airport loaded us on the plane there was no water soap or paper in the bathrooms. Half of the food was missing. On my return flight when I got to the airport I was told the connecting flight I was booked on does not even connect with the flight to NY in Lagos and doesn't leave for another 5 hours and that I could try again 2 days later but the same thing would probably happen. So they booked a flight connection that doesn't exist! I spent $1900 on a new flight out of SL on Brussels.

### Arik Air customer review
I waited in Port Harcourt airport for 10 hrs for a flight and we were never told a thing by Arik reps. The same story for the time the plane was arriving and when it did arrive my Emirates flight had departed Lagos at 2130. I made it to Lagos at 1130 and had to change my flight and get a hotel. A poor excuse for an airline and customer relations is even worse. I came back into Lagos and got delayed by 3 hrs again coming to Port Harcourt.

### Arik Air customer review
Return flight from Lagos Nigeria to London 13th July 2013. Departure was 3pm but didn't take off until 7pm. No information or explanation provided. Things got unbearable. Eventually staff advised the delay was due to lack of aviation fuel. This only angered passengers even more as it was clear this was a lie and has now become the airline's only excuse for delayed flights! Destination was meant to be London Heathrow but was informed just 20 mins to landing that it would be Gatwick. At this point there was no holding back the passengers (most of which had young children) and most refused to come down from the plane until provisions were made to get all to Heathrow.

### Arik Air customer review
July 3 2013. New York City to Lagos. When we landed in Lagos we were told to fill out an Immigration form only to find out that we didn't need to fill out the form because we were transiting. Then told to go and get our suitcases. Waited 2.5 hrs only to be told that our suitcase had already been put on another plane. July 24 2013. In Accra Ghana told there was a delay on our flight to Lagos. Flight supposed to leave at 5.45pm flight did not leave until 8.30pm. When we got to Lagos we sat in the airport for 6 hours with no explanation as to why we were still in the airport. Told that once again the plane did not have fuel. Finally allowed to board. Flight attendants rude and had a nasty attitude.

### Arik Air customer review
New York-Lagos-Accra return. The cabin crew was excellent. The Arik staff at Lagos airport were not the nicest people and they demanded money for everything. From Accra my group and I checked in as a group without any problems but because the folks in Nigeria wanted more Kobos and Nairas. In any case this will be my last flight on Arik unless major changes are made.

### Arik Air customer review
Disappointment! This is my second time flying with Arik and service seems to have got worse. When I first travelled with Arik from NY to Lagos the television did not work on my flight there was a very nasty flight attendant and when returning from Lagos to NY the televisions did not work again so I was stuck on an 11 hour flight with children that cried most of the flight. Attendants were much more pleasant. Now my flight has been delayed for the third time tonight by Arik without any explanations! No one seems to care about customers. I wish them the best and hope they improve but as for me this will be my last time flying with them!

### Arik Air customer review
Roundtrip from JFK to Lagos return to JFK last week. Although both flights left late they arrived on time. Excellent business class service. Food and service was great could not ask for any better service and flat beds afforded me a fine 8 hour nap both ways.

### Arik Air customer review
No blankets provided until an 1hr into the flight staff were rude and blanket tossed at us without any form of gesture. No headsets throughout the duration of the flight expected to be staring at the screen without being able to listen. Over 3 toilets were out of service and toilets functioning were in a horrible state. When we pressed the call bell cabin crews ignored them for close to an hour. Return flight delayed 3 hours in Lagos. TV screens were not working and again no headsets. We kept complaining to cabin crew who reset the TV however never came back to check if it had started working. Again 2 of the toilets were also out of order. I believe this will be the last time I fly ARIK that is how bad a service myself and my wife received on our recent trip to Lagos Nigeria and back to London UK.

### Arik Air customer review
Leg room on A340 gives a generous pitch and baggage allowance is a generous 30 kilos. Inflight entertainment was very poor. They didn't provide headphones I was told the IFE did not work in some seats. Eventually I was given headphones and told to try my luck quality was very poor. The food was very bland- and the portions small. I was within the first 20 and told the beef had run out. Crew were polite enough but I didn't get the impression of being greatly experienced. Fly Arik if you want a comfortable seat and have a lot of luggage if inflight entertainment food and service is important to you stay well clear.

### Arik Air customer review
Flew to Nigeria on Arik return. My flights were most disappointing in Premier Class (Business Class). The meals were not particularly appetizing. There a long stretch of time between the first meal and the last the attendants refused to provide snacks to passengers who asked. They gladly offered alcoholic beverages but refused snacks. The entertainment system in the premier compartment (for a 13 hour flight) was not working. Given the cost of the flight the overall poor service this experience lead me to the decision to stop flying Arik Air. On arrival at both destinations my luggage which was tagged with "Priority" labels but were among the last pieces off luggage to exit the plane.

### Arik Air customer review
London Heathrow to Lagos in Business. From check-in to arrival staff were very good. Arik offers entry to the Skyteam Lounge at Heathrow T4. Cabin crew on the Airbus A340 were friendly welcoming and took care of passengers. Aircrafts are modern and the cabins look new. Their premium product has full flat bed seats and duvets and large screens for inflight entertainment. Food is of a high standard of quality and presentation and again the cabin crews' attitude surpassed some of the major airlines. A a spacious lounge and bar on the plane is available for premium passengers. The flight arrived in Lagos 30 minutes early.

### Arik Air customer review
Arrived at Cotonou airport for flight from Cotonou to Lagos at 04.20 hours. Flight scheduled at 06.20. The flight was cancelled but the truly dreadful thing was that passengers were informed by airport security. No representative from Arik Air bothered to appear at the airport to make alternative arrangements for passengers. I was forced to hire a driver at short notice to drive me to Lagos and inevitably missed my onward connection. Customer service about as bad as it is possible to imagine.

### Arik Air customer review
We have flown Martinair 3 times to Orlando. We have chosen Martinair because they are cheap and are the only one flying non-stop to Orlando. However it's a pity that you have to pay for personal entertainment in Economy whereas in the Comfort Class it's free. Further more the cabin crew on these flights were very helpful.

### Arik Air customer review
I have just returned from a trip to Lagos Nigeria in Economy Class from Heathrow. I can not fault the aeroplane there was lots of leg room (and my partner and I are not short at 5ft10 and 6ft2) good entertainment selection and plenty of food and drink throughout the journey. All the staff were welcoming and the plane was clean. My only complaint would be that both food options on the way out were spicy Nigerian dishes (but this is only because I am fussy if you like spicy food you will love the selection) however on the way back there was a non spicy dish which was lovely. I would not hesitate to fly with Arik again.

### Arik Air customer review
I have flown Arikair (both long & short haul) a few times now and got mixed experiences. The not so good experience was with the ground staff at Lagos in May 2010 when I was harassed & dispossessed of expensive perfume bottles (50mls each) with contents even less. I wrote a letter of complaint but never got a reply. Generally the services are fair but lack of online checking and ineffective communication has let it down. I can also observe that the aircrafts are flown 1/2 or less full most of the time and wonder why prices are still up.

Arik Air seem to have no idea of what customer service means and how their scheduling problems adversely affect the lives of their passengers. Arik Air schedule a return flight from Accra to Lagos for 1745. the flight almost never leaves Accra before 2100 (Accra Time) which means that you arrive in Lagos at 2330 at the earliest (there are instances of the passengers finding themselves going home from the airport at 2am (Lagos time). So a journey that is supposed to be a 45min flight now becomes 6 hours with no consideration of customer comfort from the airline. On the evening flight from Lagos to Accra I have experienced similar delays (with no information coming from the Arik ground Staff) for almost 3hours. I had to call the Arik Reservations line to get information repeatedly. In Accra no information is given on the delay no provision is made from refreshments or for the comfort of Arik passengers and on top of that you get treated like a nuisance because you have to ask repeatedly on the status of the flight as no information is given either over the information system or by Arik Ground staff.

Purchased round trip tickets from to Dakar to Freetown. Dakar to Freetown flight was 2 hours late. Our ticket for the Freetown to Dakar flight said Wednesday but when we went to the airport Wednesday morning we were told that our flight left the day before. We inquired at the Freetown office and they told us that they switched the day of that flight 6 months prior! Dakar office had sold us a ticket for a flight that did not exist! That left us to scramble and buy a ticket from another airline to make our connecting flight home. Not much of an apology either. If travelling in Africa you can expect more professionalism from a minibus driver and less snooty attitude too.

We were due to travel from Abuja to London on 25 February - 3 days before we were notified the flight had been cancelled due to unscheduled maintenance. We attended their offices the following day and received the worst kind of customer service. Indifferent attitudes and a total lack of customer care. They couldn't tell us when next they were due to fly to London from Abuja. Neither could they arrange for us to take a flight from Lagos to London on Friday due to lack of information. It was as if no one knew what was going on and no one was bothered to find out on our behalf. They made it seem like it was our fault that the flight was cancelled and made no attempts to offer a rescheduled flight. Out of frustration we were forced to buy another ticket from another airline. To make it worse they are now refusing to provide us with a refund.

Lagos to London. Thhe worst flight I have taken. Boarding delayed by 1 hour due to technical difficulties. When we did board there was no air conditioning and the cabin was unbearably hot. It was left for passengers to get water from the galley which was not freely offered. An announcement was then made that our direct flight would be stopping in Abuja to collect more passengers which resulted in what can only be described as a riot amongst the passengers. The cabin crew were incapable of dealing with the situation as passengers charged up and down the cabin changing seats and classes at will. After a further hour on the ground it took members of the public to pacify the passengers begging with them to return to their seats over the intercom. Eventually we did take off for the short flight to Abuja. On landing we were forced to sit for a further 2 hours without air conditioning and forced to sit through further unrest whilst the cabin crew watched on. At one stage they even threatened to leave the aircraft. Refuelling took a long long time. At this point we had still had no food and were helping ourselves to drinks. We landed in London 5.5 hours late with lame apologies and little remorse from the airline no help from ground staff with missed onward connections. I will never use Arik again.

Dakar to Freetown return the flight was okay but the airline purposefully cheated us on purchasing the ticket in Dakar - and the return flight from Freetown was late in arriving spent more time than necessary on a stop-over in Banjul. Bottom line the service was marginally acceptable plane was modern - but they seem to be scam artists when it comes to ticketing. I would not fly Arik unless there is no other alternative.

The worst airline I have ever flown. Nice new aircraft (ex Kingfisher Airlines) but nothing works - including the crew. Flight was 2 hours late and the service was very poor for an airline that markets itself as 'World Class'. I went to ask for water and the Cabin Crew was asleep.

Lagos to JFK Business Class. New A340 the seat was lay flat and fairly spacious. Cabin almost empty while Economy was full. Even so the crew had trouble remembering to bring my food and never got around to headphones. The food they remembered to bring was fair to good. In seat power made up for thin AVOD so one could watch computer movie. Seat controls a bit contrived but functional. Arik was only airline in Lagos to take a credit card even though the purchase process was painful. Check in very confused but that seems to be the Lagos airport staff. Still a better experience than the US airlines international service.

Have flown several times between Lagos domestic (Old terminal) and Warri. Flights on time and flight attendants attentive and friendly. Be warned that you'll have to hunt down your gate at Lagos if you want to be sure of catching your flight. It's not unusual for staff to just wander off for no announcements to be made and for passengers to be running across the runway at the last minute with their baggage in hand. On one occasion a Dutch wetlease service was used from Warri to Lagos older but it was a comfortable plane with one Dutch and one Nigerian FA both friendly and professional. The safety briefing was even done a second time as one passenger point blank refused to pay attention the first time and wouldn't remove their earphones. Food onboard constituted a carton of five alive juice and either a pain au chocolate or the standard Nigerian mystery meat pasty. Good luck with that one. Security at Warri as corrupt as anywhere else in Nigeria. Despite the airport being funded by Shell don't expect any special attention if you work for them though here they are particularly aggressive rather than the usual passive begging.

Heathrow - Lagos and Lagos - Banjul. Very positive experience on every flight - both in economy and business (premier) class. LHR-LOS service excellent new aircraft flat beds in premier class - fares are more reasonable than BA and Virgin Atlantic. The issue is with their booking arrangements - you can make a reservation option online but then have to telephone to confirm and pay for the flight by phoning their London office (in my case). Also a lot of UK travel agents have difficulty booking Arik Air flights.

Flown with them severally especially on the ABV-CBQ ABV-ENU ABV-BNI and occasional ABV-LOS route and there is still a lot to be done with regards to their customer service. Their ticketing and reservations (you can't purchase online unlike VK and AJ) systems leave a lot to be desired. Its usually chaotic at the purchase points and the ground staff are more concerned with barking orders at intending passengers. The inflight service is a continuation of what obtains on ground. Its a real shame for an airline that has such competent pilots and excellent equipment. They have to improve their act because in Nigeria they are becoming a byword for poor customer service and that has started affecting passenger loads. I only fly them because they offer direct flights to my major areas of operation.
