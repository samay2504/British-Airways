### "Definitely recommend them"
Not Verified | Excellent airline. Flights outbound and return were on time, if not early. Service and staff were helpful and friendly and the plane was very comfortable. Definitely recommend them. The only negatives: the film choice was not great for an English speaker, and there was, if anything, too much food served!

### "Absolutely disgraceful operation"
Absolutely disgraceful operation. All our booking confirmations stated 1 bag max 32kg luggage FREE. Manager in LAX was one of the rudest airline employees we've dealt with. Despite it being in black and white on our contractual booking receipt she wouldn't let us travel unless we paid $120 excess luggage. We pre-ordered special meals (AVML). On the return sector, we were handed regular meals. We asked if our special meals had been loaded. Crew member scoffed. What kind of special food? The AVMLs we ordered'. We don't have any'. He handed me a pizza. I asked if it was vegetarian. Yes, it's cheese' I inspected the pizza. It had pork ham on it. When I showed him he took it, walked off and continued the service. Had I not asked for his solution I would not have had any food at all. Unforgivable to insist food is vegetarian when it's not. What about Muslims and food allergies too? His attitude was disgraceful. Never again.

### "Worst airline ever"
Worst airline ever. Flight cancelled same morning due to “maintenance”. Rebooked to 2 days later. No hotels in Tahiti available. They told people to get airbnbs. No compensation.

### "Worst customer service ever"
Got a flight delay because of "technical reason" but there was no problem and the staff told it was actually because it was too late (5pm). So the flight got postponed by 1 day making me loose the money of the hotel I booked for that night (non refundable) and shorten my time on Tikehau island. The only "compensation" they provided was a snack and a drink. Ridiculous! I asked them for a refund of the night i spent for nothing because of them the following day (14/10/2023) and only got a reply 06/06/2024 so 8 months later to told me they wouldn't do anything. Worst customer service ever from an airline company. Such a shame there is no other company locally providing more flight to these small islands to dethrone them.

### "No one cares"
Not Verified |   We were a family of 7 people, ranging from 7 year old to 80 year old with walking difficulties. It was a midnight flight out of LAX to PPT. The food delivery truck hit the side of our plane. But the gate agents lied to us and kept saying it was "paperwork", and "security" issues. We all knew that they lied because they didn't want to call it "mechanical" issue because they would be liable for the passengers somehow. Then finally around 2 am, they told us the flight was "delayed" until that morning at 10 am, and told us to go to ticketing, where they will help us with hotels and transportation. When we got to the ticketing counter, they did not help us at all. They did not offer us any hotel rooms, or transportation help. We were on our own. They offered NO help at all. And we were the 4th party at the counter. Before we left the counter that night / morning, I repeatedly asked the agent if we will have the same assigned seats? Because we had children and elderly passengers. They repeatedly promised me yes, we have the exact same seats. Next morning came. We came back, along with hundreds of passengers. When we got to the counter, the agent scattered the 7 of us all around the plane separately. How incredible is that. We were connecting to Bora Bora, which we already missed due to the flight delay. So I asked the agent about that. She said we will have guaranteed seats the next morning. Don't worry. Well, we didn't. We spent an entire day the next morning in PPT waiting for standby, and we had to fly separately to Bora Bora again. And one more lie. We had no accommodations when we get to PPT, because our final destination was Bora Bora, and by the time we land in PPT, there were no more flights to Bora Bora. So we will need to stay overnight in PPT. The agent told us that there will be someone in their domestic office in Tahiti to help us find lodging. Well, that was a lie too. When we got there, their domestic flight office had closed and no one was there to help us. So we were there again to fend for ourselves. Anyways, I filed a complaint for all the extra costs incurred during the debacle, and the missed hotel stay in Bora Bora. I have been working with one of their agents for almost a year now, via email. He is as unhelpful as anyone can be. I don't feel the customer service attitude. He repeatedly ignores me, drags his feet, as evidenced by it being almost a year!! They have no phone number available to chat with. I have no way of escalating my case. I asked him to talk to his supervisor. Nothing. He just ignores me. I called the only phone number there is for ATN - reservations. I called them and asked to speak to their supervisor, thinking that they might know the supervisor of customer service. I have not heard back from them. Every time I call the number, their supervisor has been at a meeting, and they always tell me the manager would call me back. They never have. Do yourself a favor and ask yourself: Would you go with an airline that doesn't even give you access to proper customer service.? Technically" they have customer service, via email. There is no one to talk to. Just think about that. I have no recourse. I have no way of escalating, and I can't find anyone that is willing to help me. No one cares. Things like this sound crazy whenever I come across them. They sound like it comes from a negative person who likes to complaint or make up stories,  until it happened to me.

### “crew great, friendly, and professional”
The crew were great, friendly, and professional. Food was okay for airline food. The seat in business is the issue. I'm not tall at 5' 10" (1.7m) and I found it difficult to lie comfortably because of the very narrow foot space on the Rockwell Collins Diamond flatbed seats. In every other respect, this seat was very comfortable and the blanket provided is one of the best I've ever seen. In fairness, on the return journey, I did get some solid sleep for about six hours, but hardly surprising as the plane was due to take off at 23:59 and was delayed until 00:30. The IFE is pretty limited, so glad I had a book. As this airline has a virtual monopoly on this route the ticket price is very high.

### "the experience was awful"
Not Verified |  Absolutely waste of money. We flew from Auckland to Los Angeles, and the experience was awful. Worst airline I’ve ever flown with. The service in the cabin was very average, and the airport staff were rude, unprofessional, and aggressive. I personally trusted Air New Zealand as I bought the ticket from them, and it am wonder how Air New Zealand partnered with such a low quality air line.

### "offered zero compensation"
Not Verified |  Shockingly bad service from this airline. The flight was originally going to land at 7 am and I took this into account when making other travel reservations. Then, about a day before the flight, they told us it was cancelled, and they put us on a different flight that would arrive 14 hours later, around 9 pm. Upon calling them, Air Tahiti Nui offered zero compensation and said that even if I filed a claim, nothing would likely happen. I had to rebook my following connections out of my pocket.

### "purposeful misinformation"
This review is difficult to write since I was never able to actually fly with Air Tahiti Nui. The company recently had a workers strike that caused them to cancel multiple flights. The issue here isn’t the strike, it is how ATN handled it. Their response to the situation was terrible, with not only a lack of communication to affected passengers, but purposeful misinformation when you spoke to their representatives. My wife and I talked about taking this trip 10 years ago when we got married. We saved our money, spent the last 7 months planning, and then flew to LAX the day before our flight to PPT via ATN. Less than 23 hours before take-off, they cancelled the flight. They provided nothing more than general statements saying they were in the process of rebooking. Then nothing but silence. My wife called their representatives later in the day and were told that we would have a flight out THAT DAY and would be contacting us. Then more silence, nothing. Again called in and were offered a flight 4 days from now, cutting our trip on half. Absolutely unacceptable. We ended up not getting rebooked, not receiving any direct communication from ATN, and had to cancel our trip. If they had been more prepared for this contingency, as most competent enterprises are, they would have had plans in place in why to do when this happens. Instead, we lost our chance to go to Bora Bora. This experience was not unique with many other passengers having to cancel their trips due to Air Tahiti Nui's utter lack of planning and communication. My recommendation is to stay clear of Air Tahiti Nui. They may not be a problem for your trip, but their incompetence is readily apparent. If things go sideways, I don’t trust them to know what they’re doing.

### "Absolutely ridiculous!"
Not Verified |  Air Tahiti Nui is absolutely horrible! My husband and I bought tickets from Air Tahiti Nui to go to Tahiti for our honeymoon. We had a connecting flight with another airline. My husband and I paid an additional $60 through Air Tahiti Nui so we could sit together on a 8 hour international flight. Due to a flight time change, our ticket numbers changed. Air Tahiti Nui’s system did not sync with the other airlines system. Therefore, Air Tahiti Nui lost our reservation and sold our seats that we paid for! Then, Air Tahiti Nui blamed us for changing our ticket numbers. I’m not sure how that is even possible to do on our end! After going back and fourth with Air Tahiti Nui for 2 hours at the airport, they found 2 spots for us on the flight. However, the seats were not together despite the fact we paid an additional $60 to sit together. Absolutely ridiculous! No wonder their reviews are so low.

### "flight crew was excellent"
Not Verified |  The best airline I have flown with. Everything was as expected for business class. The seats were to die for! I actually slept and I never sleep on a plane. The flight crew was excellent and the landing was the best I’ve experienced. Definitely recommend flying with them.

### "a very comfortable flight"
I flew Air Tahiti Nui from Los Angeles to Auckland via Tahiti. I was a very comfortable flight. The meals were good and the seats were comfortable. I was sick on the flight and they looked after me. I will fly them again.

### "This airline is unreliable"
This airline is unreliable. They will make you late, make you miss your connecting flight and leave you to sort your problems out at your own cost without any help. Unbelievable. It cost us an extra $248 to sort out flights because their plane had a technical issue. Their problem, their fault they admitted. They promised to compensate at the airport and then later using fine print reneged on their responsibilities. Of all the 20 international flights that arrived in Auckland the same day theirs was the only one more than 10 minutes late. They were 2 hours late. We were stuck for an additional 4 hours at Auckland airport before we could get a new connecting flight. The plane was chocker, not a spare seat, they were getting the best part of $2000 a seat and they still couldn't find a measly $124pp to compensate us for their screwup/

### "Business Class product was terrible"
Their lack of care, lack of support and lack of customer service is monumental. My wife and I were celebrating our anniversary and heading to Bora Bora. Air Tahiti from LAX to Papeete and then on Air Tahiti (regional carrier) to Bora Bora. About 2 hours prior to our late night flight, Air Tahiti Nui cancelled the flight. The reason was that the incoming aircraft was struck by lightning. Understanding that safety is paramount and absolutely the most important factor of traveling, we understood that the aircraft had to be inspected. Keep in mind that Air Tahiti Nui only has like 4 aircraft in their fleet so it's not like they can quickly bring in a new aircraft. We were shuttled to an airport hotel at LAX and told to come back in the next day as the flight would now depart at 2pm. Back to LAX we went and learned that Air Tahiti Nui kept delaying the flight with no information or communication to the passengers. When a Gate Agent did appear, we were advised that they are third party employees and have no further details. All this while we were watching tape being put on the front of the aircraft where it was struck by lightning. After hours again in LAX, the flight finally departed. Upon arrival in Tahiti there was no one from Air Tahiti Nui to provide hotel vouchers (as the majority of passengers were connecting to neighboring islands and there were no regional flights out that late). There was a line of about 200+ passengers waiting for some assistance from one woman sitting in the Air Tahiti office! After hours of waiting we were put up in literally a dump of a motel for the night. Knowing that the flight was cancelled the previous day, why would they not have staff ready to assist their passengers as well as hotel vouchers for those stuck in Papeete. Take my recommendation, fly an alternate carrier if going to Tahiti. Their Business Class product was terrible. 2x2x2 seating on a 787 where others offer plenty more room. Inflight entertainment was very limited and food was "just OK' but nothing I would expect from a flag carrier. Internet never worked and while flight attendant service was very cordial, it certainly does not make up for their lack of customer service. We lost nights in Bora Bora and I have written a letter to Air Tahiti Nui and the response basically was "sh*t happens". Air France, United, Delta would be the carriers of choice.

### "they do not care about servicing their passengers"
We were a party of 5 in Papeete heading out for cruise when the Tahitian government shut down all cruises. I contacted Air Tahiti immediately to see if we could get a flight home. The shut down occurred on a Friday and we could not catch a flight home until the following Wednesday which resulted in 5 more hotel nights. Air Tahiti charged us $1,048.00 per ticket for the flight home in the same class of service. If we didn't pay the $1,048.00 per ticket, Air Tahiti wanted to charge us $90.00 per ticket to drop down a class. The Air Tahiti standard pricing between main cabin and business class in normally $3,000.00 per ticket, the class drop should have resulted in a refund. Do not fly this airline, they do not care about servicing their passengers and taking advantage of their customers.

### "Truly disappointed with the service"
Truly disappointed with the service. Avoid at all costs. Had a family emergency and desperately needed to get home. Tried to change my flights and willing to pay. The tool for managing the your bookings online is not available. Confirmed via phone. Phone support non existent. Called 15+ times and finally learned that the call center is not authorized to make booking changes or buy new flights. Drove to the airport office. Airport office is not authorized either to sell tickets or change bookings. Only accepted way is via email. Waited for three days already trying to change my flight. In the meantime, family member has passed away and Air Tahiti Nui was not helpful at all getting home. Will never fly this airline again. To top it off, my luggage was lost for 4 days when I arrived in Tahiti. When I received my luggage, it was damaged. Complete failure.

### "We haven't flown yet, I'm not looking forward to it!"
Not Verified |  My husband and I travel a lot internationally. I don't remember having as much trouble booking with an airline. Unfortunately, they are our only option, we booked thru American Airlines. Trying to get seat assignments was extremely painful. It took 2 days and 4 phone calls, totalling 3 hours. When I waited for an option for seats, it took over 20 min each time. When I questioned the agent, she wanted to give me the whole reason behind how "much work" this was for her. I said I 'm not really interested, let's just get on with booking the seats please. After waiting 40min, I lost my connection! How convenient! BTW, if you get seat assignments before check in, you must pay. We haven't flown yet, I'm not looking forward to it! If at all possible, I will not be using this airline again.

### "embarrassing that they don't know the difference"
Not Verified |  When I checked in they asked me if I had a ticket out of the US and I said yes and showed my ticket to Mexico. They said that is not valid as Mexico is part of the US. I said that no Mexico is not part of the US, they even called the supervisor who said the same thing. They made me buy a ticket back to my country which I didn't want at that time because I didn't know my return date yet. I bought this flight with Qantas but when I arrived it was Air Tahiti. I had to buy the ticket in 20 minutes otherwise they wouldn't let me board. It is embarrassing that they don't know the difference between the two countries and argue with customers like this. If this is their policy at least it should be on their website.

### "we must respect distancing, it is just impossible"
Food: the food from a quality standpoint, from Tahiti to Paris, had nothing to do with being in Business Class. Seat comfort: having selected a six abreast configuration on an ultra long haul flight it is just a no sense choice. I was lucky enough to be seated on an aisle seat but for outboard PAX on LH & RH side, it is just a headache to get access to the aisle. This seat does not have enough personal belongings storage and feet area is just to narrow to have a great sleeping position. Lavatory: the airline decided to lock the forward lavatory exclusively to crew. It means 30 PC PAX + 30 PYC PAX are sharing only two Lav's near door 2. During these times when we must respect distancing, it is just impossible. This airlines needs to remember their revenue is coming from passengers.

### "What kind of customer service is this?"
My June 20th flight to Papeete was canceled by the airline due to COVID restrictions. When trying to get the $2300 or so back, I made at least 15 calls to my booking company and the airline. Booking company said Air Tahiti had to authorize any refund. Air Tahiti at first said they would only provide future credit (illegal for flights departing from the US) and then offered a refund minus a $250 service fee per person. I eventually filed a complaint with the DOT and was told by the airline they had received it. Later airline said they actually had not received it and couldn't process a refund until the DOT complaint was received. What kind of customer service is this? The agents are basically instructed to lie and give people the runaround. Eventually had the charge reversed by my credit card company.

### "never fly Air Tahiti Nui"
I booked this flight via Cheapoair it was supposed to leave April 14, 2020. Then the Coronavirus hit. The flight never left for Papeete it was cancelled by the airline. I requested a refund through Cheapoair because Air Tahiti Nui said it was bought through Cheapoair. I dealt with Cheapoair who checked with air Tahiti Nui about refunding me my money. We paid almost $1500.00 for two tickets. I was offered a credit which has to be used by next year or I lose the credit of the two tickets to Papeete. I wanted my money back as I, like thousands, of others had nothing to do with the cancellation. It was a worldwide pandemic. I am told now that I can get my money back with a $500.00 penalty. The quoted amount to be returned is approximately $750.00 for a $1500.00 investment. Which is more than a $500.00 penalty. I have filed a complaint with the Dept of Transportation who frowns on this type of rip off. I will never fly Air Tahiti Nui or use Cheapoair for any reason. I am a senior citizen with a compromised immune system and am not sure when I will be able to travel due to the Coronavirus.

### "fly with an American airline"
Not Verified |  I was flying direct to Papeete, Tahiti for a cruise that was leaving 10/5/20. However, due to Covid-19 my cruise got canceled. I purchased my ticket in December 2019. When I contacted Tahiti Nui they offered no refunds but offered to extend my ticket for 2 months until 12/2/20. They offer a year beyond date from purchase. So buying early only hurt me. I can't fly this year for obvious reasons. However, they gave my friend and travel companion a year from this December and she can use it by 12/31/21. She made a big fuss and they gave it to her. She only spoke up about herself only and not me. When I contacted the airline about this to the Service Manager  he said due to her circumstances being a single mother she was given this. Pure discrimination! I'm a retired senior on a fixed income but that doesn't matter. They refused to extend my ticket like hers. I wrote to the VP of the Company and never heard back. I lost 1500.00 and got rid of a person I thought was a friend. Please fly with an American airline if you can.

### "never book through Air Tahiti Nui"
I booked flights through Air Tahit Nui before COVID 19. A leg of our flights for July 2020 has been cancelled by the airline, and they offered to change our flights to still fly on the same day, even though there is a ban on international travel (which they acknowledge). We have been told that if we want to change our flight to any other day, we would have to pay $100 per person per fight. Save yourself the headache and never book through Air Tahiti Nui. They are dodgy. We thought they were a reputable company but they are not. How can they expect us to fly why there is a ban on travel. Absolute joke.

### "Cabin staff did an OK job"
Not Verified |  The airplane was almost new and was in good condition. Departed and arrived on time. No problems with the checked bags. The seat back was a bit on the thin side (the new 'slim' seat design). Seat back video screen worked fine but the selection of movies, TV programs, etc. was rather limited but OK for a night flight. Food was good but not outstanding and it was served quickly after departure. Check-in at PPT started only about 3 hr. before departure. Cabin staff did an OK job but were not outstanding. As the plane departed at midnight most people wanted to go to sleep rather than anything else. Overall the flight was as good as or slightly better than flights offered by United Airlines.

### "One of the worst airlines"
Los Angeles to Papeete in December 2019. One of the worst airlines I have ever flown in my life. Not only are they incredibly rude, and very poorly managed, you should see the letter I got from their CEO - no CEO in their right mind would ever write something as stupid and rude as this - it is truly incredible Air Tahiti Nui does not deserve your business, fly Air France and/or United to and from French Polynesia instead.

### "quick and efficient service"
Papeete to Los Angeles. We left for Polynesia just before Covid-19 blocked North America. Our flight had more than 150 empty seats. The plane was very clean, very welcoming, very colourful and the service on board was impeccable! But the 5 stars is especially justified with our return flight. We had to return to Canada long before our planned return and having bought our tickets through an agency, it was up to them to make the changes. It goes without saying that the agency was completely overwhelmed and therefore unreachable and of no help! So we called ATN and spoke to 3 different people, all 3 were kind, patient and helpful than the others! In the end, we were able to dodge our agency and modify our tickets free of charge, for the same evening. In these times of crisis, even the staff at check-in and onboard were very welcoming and helpful. Congratulations to the entire ATN team and thank you for your quick and efficient service! | Nous sommes parti pour la Polynésie juste avant que Covid-19 ne bloque l'Amérique du nord. Notre vol avait plus de 150 places vide... l'avion était très propre, très accueillant, très coloré et le service à bord était impeccable ! Mais les 5 étoiles se justifie surtout avec notre vol de retour. Nous avons du revenir vers le Canada bien avant notre retour prévu, et ayant acheté nos billets via une agence, c'était à eux de faire les changements. Il va sans dire que l'agence était complètement débordé et donc injoignable et d'aucune aide! Nous avons donc appelé ATN et avons parlé à 3 personnes différentes, toutes les 3 plus gentilles, patientes et serviables les unes que les autres ! Au final, nous avons pu esquiver notre agence et modifier nos billets sans frais, pour le soir même. En ces temps de crise, même le personnel au check in et à l'embarquement ont été très accueillants et serviables. Bravo à toute l'équipe d'ATN et merci pour votre service rapide et efficace!

### "I would look elsewhere"
This was the first time flying Air Tahiti Nui. My goal was to fly from LAX to PPT (Tahiti) then PPT to BOB (Bora Bora). The nightmare started on our flight from LAX to PPT. Discovered Air Tahiti Nui does not have a designated ticket counter so you can only check in 2 hours before flight departs. This caused an issue because in order to gain access to any club lounge you need a boarding pass. Our flight arrived in LAX about 5 hours before the LAX to PPT departed so had to sit and wait in LAX for 3 hours until Air Tahiti Nui ticket counter opened. By that time there was a long line of people and the staff at Air Tahiti Nui did not seem to care how fast they processed people. So we were not able to go to our lounge and eat and relax so we had to pay for our lunch and stand around because of very limited seating in the lobby of LAX. After checking our bags we went to the gate displayed on my ticket and on the overhead boards and on my flight app. Several people started going up the the gate ticket counter asking why boarding had not started with only 10 minutes before our flight was suppose to depart. No answers. Staff simply did not seem to care. Five minutes before boarding an announcement was made of a gate change to 153 which was about 1/2 mile away all the way down to the other end of the concourse. We ran to the the other end only to wait 1.5 hours to board with more delays and no explanation. During this time I talked to a couple the long time LAX employees. They stated this happens all the time with Air Tahiti Nui. During our flight we purchase exit row seats. The Air Tahiti Nui staff allowed long lines to queue up and use our exist row areas as acceptable areas for people to stand and stretch, causing people to step on our feet several times. We brought this to the attention of the staff but they did not seem to care. Service was touted a very friendly and a great Tahitian experience. Do not believe what they tell you and show in their slick ads. We had a similar experience on way back. Sorry but once from LAX to PPT and PPT to LAX was enough. There are a lot of other airline choices like Air France etc. I would look elsewhere. Hopefully this review helped describe our experience. Even more concerning is we did not find Tahiti the friendly place to stay either. Expensive, and not very customer service orientated

### "very unprofessional service"
Not Verified | Auckland to Papeete. From unannounced menu changes to wine that although listed on the menu was unavailable with cabin crew staff who very conveniently "forgot" passenger requests, a very unprofessional service. On an Emirates scale of 1 to 10 (with Emirates at 10), this outfit rates a 4 on a par with Air Fiji. Never again!

### "we had no reimbursement at all"
Los Angeles to Papeete. We used this airline to reach Polynesia for our honeymoon. We read good reviews about this and that's the reason why we opted for this company for the most important trip. When we arrived at the airport in Los Angeles we found out our flight was cancelled without any previous warning. Reason: there was no pilot! Bad organinzation at the airport and had to wait hours in a queue and lost one entire day of honeymoon stuck in LA. Worst thing is that we had no reimbursement at all as the company is not European and doesn't follow any European rule for reimbursment as the flight doesn't leave or reach an European country. Won't use with company anymore! Much better to prefer Air France to reach Tahiti, as prices are the same, but customers are protected as I found out Air Tahiti Nui often behave like that.

### "asked for a full refund"
We were boarding on a flight by Air Tahiti Nui from Paris to LA going on a short trip. After an hour delay we were told the flight is delayed till next day due to a thunder striking the plane. We were located to hotel to wait for a flight next day. Next day we were told the flight is delayed for one more day. Overall we lost two days and there was no point to go to LA for us anymore, we missed everything and lost a lot of money. We didn’t go in a flight and asked for a full refund I didn’t mention other expenses we had due to this I only asked for a 2 tickets refund. We received the refund later but 150 were deducted. I emailed few times to ask for a reason? I received no reply. We lost so much due to this situation and all I was asking is give the money back for a ticket.

### "Staff very helpful / attentive"
Not Verified |  Los Angeles to Tahiti with Air Tahiti Nui. Plane was very clean, useful little bag of goodies, (ear buds, socks, night visor, etc) Food and drink - wonderful. Far better than domestic US flights Staff very helpful / attentive - made a very long flight better! Well Done!

### "never been treated so badly"
Not Verified |  Papeete to Auckland. Customer portal down September 8th and 9th, so cannot event put a complaint through, no email back from their customer service yet. I went to the Papeete airport at 6am for my 9am flight. Checked in, baggage, everything. As the departure time drew near, we were none the wiser on the delay. Finally 9am rolled around, and they told us it would be another hour delay. More and more time was added, and none of the announcements were legible. Finally they tell us the flight is cancelled. They make us walk out of the airport in the heat, and go through customs which took a very long time. Then, we were forced to cue in a line to find out when the next flight was available. Everyone waited in line for an hour. When I got to the front of the line, they told me it was up to me to find my own accommodation and that the next flight was 1am the next day - and to provide them with my email and phone (which I did, I also provided them with the Air BNB host where I was staying cell number). Luckily, they had a spare room at the Air BNB. I racked up a huge cellphone bill trying to get the car company to not cancel my rental, which, they did anyway. My host drove me to the airport the next day at 10pm. We get there to find the place empty, and security telling us that the flight was cancelled. I go to the Air Tahiti Nui office that is at the airport, and I ask why I was not emailed or phoned about this. She Shrugged her shoulders and said it was not her fault. I asked her what I am supposed to do, and luckily, the Air BNB had a couch I could stay on as every hotel was booked. I went back to the place, and awoke at 6am again. Finally on the 3rd day I boarded my flight to Australia. I have traveled to a number of tropical island places, and I know, things work a bit slower on island time. But honestly, the customer service was rude, and horrible. I have never been treated so badly - and had such a horrible experience.

### "staff really nice and kind"
Paris to Papeete via Los Angeles. New plane which is nice but actually less comfy. The older planes where on a 2-4-2 seats set-up, newer are on a 3-3-3 set-up, which give you less room on your seat. Food is okay, poor choice of entertainment but great staff, really nice and kind.

### "Poor experience"
Poor experience from Los Angeles to Papeete. Due to mechanical issues on our previous flight we lost the connection so we were booked on next available flight. We have paid for premium economy, which was unavailable on the flight we were re booked for. We tried on the phone and in the airport to get an upgrade from Air Tahiti Nui given the fact that we paid for premium economy, we had experienced an emergency landing because of mechanical issues,we were celebrating our 25th anniversary and they had empty seats in business class. They did not try to accommodate us at all and kept asking for 1400 US per person. The airplane was old, seats uncomfortable, very narrow and entertainment was a joke with very little options and very old movies. On the way back we flew the Dreamliner which was a better experience but food was a disappointment.

### "a sweaty 8 hours"
We flew from Los Angeles to Papeete and back with Air Tahiti Nui. Both planes were very hot and the food was not good. You do not have your own air control like on most flights. It was a sweaty 8 hours.

### "Good service, but poor food"
Tahiti to Los Angeles. Good service, but poor food. The Airport processing and waiting was unbearable. It took over an hour to checkin. Departure was delayed and the temperature had to be in the high 30’s. On the flight to Tahiti the second serving of food was frozen and we told the staff on board but they couldn’t have cared about that.

### "business class is old"
Air Tahiti Nui is basically the only airline that flies to French Polinesia. The business class is old, and the seat do not recline to 180°. It's a very long flight from any airport. I flew from Japan and it was a 12 hours flight. The aircraft is very loud, there is no privacy in the business seat. The food is really good and the staff are really polite. The entertainment is quite poor.

### "on board service is appalling"
Auckland to Papeete. A new Boeing 787-9, good spacious seats on Business class. We had a bulk seat 1A. Even though close to the galley I did not hear any rattling. Entertainment is very poor. This review is about the cabin crew on board service. It is appalling. They do the minimum at the cabin. No helping to set up your tray for dinner. No food order taken. They look fed up. I experienced their service to be rude, distant, unenthusiastic and Unfriendly. If you ever go to PPT fly with air New Zealand.

### "Terrible customer service"
Los Angeles to Papeete. Terrible customer service. Our return flight was originally booked on 2/6 from Tahiti to LAX. They notified us that they cancelled this flight due to schedule change.They gave us the option to leave a day earlier of the next day. We had already booked our non-refundable hotel room by this time so we inquired if we left a day earlier if they would cover our hotel cost for the night of the 5th. Verbally they assured us they would cover it so we locked in the 5th. They did say however that we would need to file a claim online with them. Which we did. We eventually got an email that said they aren't going to cover the cost of our hotel and we would need to go through travel insurance for reimbursement. Too bad we didn't have a current travel insurance plan. We called to try to get compensated in some way so we requested a free upgrade to premium economy. They said they might not have room but will add notes to our reservation for the ticket counter staff to upgrade us if there was room. 3 hrs before departure we arrive at the ticket counter and they had no idea what we were talking about as there were no notes added. They called their supervisor and we were declined due to no available seats. We board the plane and lo and behold there must have been at least 20 open seats in premium economy when the doors were closed. Lie upon lie upon lie. The only nice thing we found about this airline was the plane was a nice new 787 and the flight attendants were very accommodating.

### "customer service is terrible"
On January 17th, 2017 me and my husband travelled from Los Angeles to Auckland, New Zealand. Our flight with Air Tahiti Nui delayed almost 7 hrs because of mechanical issues with the plain in Los Angeles. When we informed the representative about our travel destination is Melbourne, she promised no problem, we will taken care of you and rebook you to other flight to make sure you reach your destination. Of course that was not the case. Because of the flight delay we missed our connecting flight in Auckland to Melbourne. Not Air Tahiti and not Air New Zealand helped us in any way when we ask help in the airport too. Both airlines pointed their finger to each other. The bottom line is we had to purchase 2 one way tickets for next day to Melbourne; cost us $800 dollars and we had to sleep in the airport in Auckland. I filed a complaint with both Airlines and I never heard back from Air Tahiti ever. I sent the e-mail to them 4 times without any acknowledgment or anything. Also, I tried to call them for a follow up, but the person on the phone told me I can reach their customer service only by e-mail. Their customer service is terrible. If you have any other airlines you can use, use other carrier.

### "positive aspect was the service"
When booking my flight from Los Angeles to Paris, I was thinking about Air France. I came across Air Tahiti Nui as a quick and cheap departure option on Expedia. I wasn't too sure about this airline. When we got to Los Angeles International Airport (LAX), we stood in the check-in line. The lady checking in our luggage was very nice and professional. As she was checking our passports and wrapping the badges on our luggage, she warned us about frequent delays on this particular flight. As she anticipated, we were delayed for about an hour or more. This was imperative because we had a shuttle service in Paris who had our initial arrival time and had to wait for us. Anyway, we boarded the aircraft and noticed that our economy seats were very small and tight. For an 11 hour flight, these seats were terribly tiny and uncomfortable. The inflight entertainment was very limited. The movie selection was limited and there wasn't a variety of genres. The positive aspect of this airline was the service. The attendants aboard the flight were efficient, responsive, cooperative, and professional. I can't think of anything else to say about the staff. The food onboard the flight was just like your generic airline food. It was cold, slimy, and disgusting. I recommend purchasing food and snacks prior your flight in the terminal. Overall, staff was great but accommodations and passenger convenience weren't well.

### "cabin staff appeared only moderately trained"
Flew Papeete to Auckland with Air Tahiti Nui. The original plane we were to take had mechanical problems so we waited for 3 hours for another plane. It appeared that there was quite a bit of confusion with this and whilst waiting we noticed the very slow boarding and taking off process of other planes. When it came our turn, whilst all were on board it still took over a half an hour to count and recount passengers. The food on both flights to and from Papeete was substandard and in two cases inedible. The cabin staff appeared only moderately trained and made me wonder how they would perform if there was a problem. Tahiti and the surrounding islands and its people are wonderful. On a return trip I would select another airline. On arrival at Auckland airport, it took three hours to organise our accomodation due to missed connections.

### "experience not to be renewed"
We booked Air New Zealand London to Papeete via Los Angeles. Flights from Los Angeles to Papeete are operated by Air Tahiti Nui. What surprised us that we were asked to check in at Papeete the proof of our flights Los Angeles to London while the flight was made in code-share with Air New Zealand. No online check in was possible, no seats were available by calling 72 hours before, but by miracle they were available at check in after getting the check in manager to assist. We kept our original seats. There is a limit to stupid systems. In short, an experience not to be renewed on Air Tahiti Nui. If this airline did not have the exclusivity on Papeete they would have disappeared a long time ago. Nous avons fait une réservation Air New Zealand Londres Papeete via Los Angeles. Les vols Los Angeles Papeete étant effectué par votre compagnie. Quelle ne fut pas notre surprise qu’on nous demande à l’enregistrement à Papeete la preuve de nos vols Los Angeles Londres alors que le vol était effectué en code-share avec Air New Zealand… Pas d’enregistrement en ligne possible, pas de places disponibles hublot en appelant 72 heures avant mais par miracle il y en avait de disponible au check in après avoir fait venir la responsable du check in. Nous avons gardé nos places d’origine. Il y a une limite à la bétise. Bref une expérience à ne pas renouveller sur Air Tahiti Nui. Si vous n’aviez pas l’exclusivité sur Papeete vous auriez disparu depuis bien longtemps.

### "service was practically non existent"
Los Angeles to Papeete (Tahiti) return. Both flights left over one hour late. While we were waiting for the plane to leave the terminal at LAX, the captain announced that we would be delayed for an hour to wait on 25 late passengers. After waiting for more than an hour and seeing a few passengers board, we finally left. This must have been the plane that was not updated as is mentioned in so many negative reviews. The tv screen in front of my seat had so many lines in it was not worth watching. What was so disappointing was the service on this flight which was practically non existent. Cups of water were served in the same size cups used in a water cooler and two would not equal one measuring cup. I received two before the crew retired for most of the flight. Drinks were served to the middle rows and when I asked for one, I was told she would come back but never did. When I pressed the call button, it was answered 5 minutes later by a male steward who said "what do you want"? He returned with my drink order which was wrong. During most of the flight, the stewardess would walk by so fast that if you said something to get their attention, they were already 4 rows behind you. Never once did I see one walking down the aisles looking at the passengers faces to see if they needed anything. The return flight also left over one hour late. The breakfast served included a sausage that I believe was bad. No cruise is worth the 8 hours I had to spend on each flight. I ended up bringing my own snacks and water to make sure I would have some on the return flight.

### "staff very nice and helpful"
Papeete to Los Angeles. We really enjoyed flying with Air Tahiti Nui. The staff is very nice and helpful. The seats are colorfull, the screens are good quality with recent movies. Everything is free onboard. We really recommend this airline.

### "recommend avoiding Air Tahiti Nui"
I would recommend avoiding Air Tahiti Nui. Our outbound flight from the US was uneventful. The plane, however, was in poor shape, with threadbare carpet, outdated seatback entertainment (some flights don't even have screens), sagging seatback pockets and below average food and service. The flight was on-time, though, and we were headed to paradise, so we could overlook these minor issues, even though the flight cost, even for an economy ticket, was at a premium price point. On our return trip is where we ran into serious issues. There was a mechanical delay on our flight, which postponed our departure for 24 hours. We waited in line for 3 hours before we had the delay and rebooking information, however, and were told that there was no possibility of being moved to one of the three other PPT-LAX flights that Air Tahiti Nui had before our rescheduled flight left. They put us up in a nice hotel overnight, so we weren't too upset at spending another day in Papeete. We had booked all of our ongoing flights out of LAX on our own due to my wife and I parting ways after the trip and her complicated international travel. Upon getting to the hotel, I began the process of rebooking all of those flights, as we were given the new departure information the following night. After breakfast the following morning, we were feeling pretty good about everything, when I just happened to check the Air Tahiti Nui website to see if our flight was still on time. Nope, we were delayed another 9 hours, which then caused us to miss all of our rebooked connections from LAX. We did not receive any notification from the airline about this additional delay. At this point, Air Tahiti Nui really let us down. They did not rebook us on any of the other departing flights for LAX. They had no consideration for connecting flights. In order for my wife to make her destination in time, we had to reroute her on another Air Tahiti Nui flight to Tokyo-Narita. They would not apply any of the funds we used for the PPT-LAX flight, nor would they simply book her on that flight at no cost due to the mechanical issue. When we spoke to customer service, we had to find all of our own solutions due to their incompetence and lack of understanding. To top it all off, they were completely indifferent and unapologetic. To this day, almost one month later, we have not been engaged by their customer service department for reparations after repeated emails and phone calls. Based on our experience, I would recommend a few things: There are other carriers that fly to/from Tahiti (Air France, Hawaiian Air, etc). Look into them and see if they are an option for you. Take a vacation somewhere else. There are a lot of nice spots in the world, and while Tahiti is exotic and amazing, our poor air travel and all that followed totally clouded our experience. If you still decide to go, and to go with Air Tahiti Nui, try to book all of your air travel through them on one ticket. Or, if you are booking your own connections, be sure to have some flexibility on your US arrival (a day or two in LA on the back end).

### "poor service and terrible seats"
Flew Air Tahiti Nui from Auckland to Los Angeles. Firstly the customer service is terrible and they can't change seats on a near empty flight because they are "not allowed to". Once on the plane I realised how uncomfortable the seats were, hard and no leg room. The service is terrible as they barely speak english and don't seem to care about customers. They served drinks once on the flight and would not get a coke for me so they just gave the terrible orange juice that was served with breakfast. The food was horrible. Entertainment barely works and is outdated. The headphones they give you are terrible and you can't hear anything with them. No space for items so I say you put your items in the overhead because you can barely fit an iPhone into the seat back pocket. I do not recommend this airline because of it's poor service and terrible seats.

### "the airline was punctual"
I flew Air Tahiti Nui in December of 2015 from LAX going to eventual spot of Bora Bora. The flight was good and the airline was punctual. Food was decent and we were fed twice on the flight. Had entertainment to keep you busy in watching movies and the cabin crew was helpful.

### "service cold and lacklustre"
Los Angeles to Papeete with Air Tahiti Nui. Travelers beware! Reservation agents rude and unwilling to process cancellation within 24 hours of booking and website does not allow online cancellation. Plane was very old. The seat, arm rest, tray table and TV monitor buttons are worn or torn. Onboard service was cold and lackluster. This airline certainly cannot compete with world-class airlines. Fly Air France to Tahiti if you are looking for superior experience.

### "worst I have ever seen"
Our original flight was scheduled to depart at 4pm but a few days prior was rescheduled to 7pm. Imagine my surprise while eating a leisurely late lunch at a hotel in Los Angeles when I get an email message from Flight Aware that the flight to Papeete now was rescheduled to the original 4pm departure. We rushed to grab our luggage, grabbed a ride to the airport only to find out that this was wrong and the flight was not to leave until 7pm. They did not load the flight until 7pm and we never took off until way after 8pm as we all sat in the most uncomfortable seats waiting for the last passenger to arrive. I do not know who designed the seating but they are the worst I have ever seen in over fourth years of flying. As for the meal service, bring a sandwich and you will be much better off. What the TV screen tells one what will be served was not even close to it and was not edible. Also if you hold an American Airlines loyalty card the only way you will get mileage credit is to book this codeshare flight through American Airlines as Air Tahiti will not post the miles to your American account. Let the flyer be aware.

### "could not have been nicer"
Los Angeles to Papeete with Air Tahiti Nui. The plane was clean and very comfortable. I agree with a previous reviewer that when extended the seats were somewhat awkward to sleep. But I managed. The dinner they served at midnight was perfect as it was a cold chicken salad and light. The rolls were warm which was very nice. By this time all seemed ready to quickly eat and then sleep. Cabin attendants could not have been nicer trying to make us more comfortable. We fly home in two weeks and will see if we are still so happy with the plane and service but at this point would very much recommend.

### "the airline did its job"
The A340 was Nuku Hiva, the youngest of the Air Tahiti Nui fleet from 2005. Left at 11:30pm, the last flight out of Tahiti in 2015. The cabin crew had made the effort to dress up and decorate the aircraft to celebrate New Year which was approximately half an hour after take-off. Served champagne before take off and after the pilot announced New Year; nice touch. The seats are comfortable and have a foot rest, but, found that the angle when extended for sleep (ever hopeful) was a wee bit awkward to find a good position - not a huge problem though and I am a bit short. There is a lot of leg room which makes it easy when seats are upright to move about. As we needed to try to sleep, we did not use the inflight entertainment. The cabin was fresh and clean, slightly better than our outward aircraft on 16 December, although that one was fine too (Moorea). These were both night flights and therefore we didn't have much contact with the cabin crew, but they were pleasant, polite and efficient although perhaps not quite so at ease with passengers as we have found on bigger international airlines. The breakfasts on both flights offered hot food and continental. It was very acceptable and included fruit and yoghurt. No complaints, the airline did its job and we were comfortable.

### "worst customer service"
Los Angeles to Auckland via Papeete. On Dec 21 noticed that Air Tahiti Nui published possible strike action by Pilots. On reading this I called Air Tahiti and was assured our flight would not be affected and we should go to checkin at LAX on Dec 22 with a scheduled departure at 11:30pm. The customer service rep then  asked if I wanted to cancel. I should have taken the opportunity. On arriving (Myself, wife plus 2 infants) we were informed the flight was cancelled and we were rescheduled onto Air New Zealand. There were 7 to 8 check in staff all congregating and joking among themselves. We were told there was an issue and we'd be scheduled onto another airline. 1 hour later we were told that we were booked on American Airlines via Sydney but had to run to another Terminal in order to make the flight. We did that, arrived at the American Airlines counter who told us that we needed a transit visa for Sydney and Air Tahiti should have known this. Also told us there were no seats and we had missed the flight. We ran back to the Air Tahiti counter in the previous terminal. Again staff just joking around, had no knowledge of transit visas. Spent next 30 minutes trying to get us on another airline. Qantas this time. We ran to that counter with one helpful staff member, checked in and Qantas sorted our visas. Stroller was lost in transit. Flight they placed us on meant a 9 hour wait in Sydney before our final journey to NZ. On check-in we were charged for our on lap infant but told that Air Tahiti would reimburse. On calling Air Tahiti I was basicially told to go away. Worst customer service in 30 years of flying.

### "crew was friendly"
I was concerned about this airline after reading many terrible reviews. My Air Tahiti Nui experience was the opposite and crew was friendly and very helpful. The leg room was better than most for economy. The food was ok. On each seat a blanket and pillow, plus a bag with socks, eye mask, ear plugs, ear phones which was a nice touch. They provided 2 meals and also offered food in the galley (sandwiches, drinks, soup and ice cream) nice selection of movies to watch also.

### "economy seat comfort was more domestic"
Budget is a word that comes to mind for Air Tahiti Nui. The "Bora Bora" A340 plane is in need of an update asap. On board entertainment unit was small and quite a few were very fuzzy. Choice is okay but not like bigger players provide and the interface unit is via Wii style hand held unit. It is not an on demand service so when the movies start you need to be read.y Because of this it takes some of the gloss flying with them. Take a tablet, Mac, Laptop when flying Air Tahiti Nui to avoid disappointment. Also have a device that can last 9 hours as there are no charging ports. The other plane we flew in their fleet had a larger tablet screen and usb port for charging. The crew did what they needed to do but nothing more, unless you buzzed them or fly business class. Seat comfort in economy was more domestic than international quality and at 3 hour mark it becomes noticeable. The armrests don't fold right up out of the way either. Food - fussy eaters and kids take snacks as meals make par but that's it, and bread rolls need a chainsaw to cut them open.

### "the worst airline I have flown"
Air Tahiti Nui is the worst airline I have flown, starting from the reservation process. The Air Tahiti Nui website is the most outdated and the customer unfriendly of any airline. My credit card was charged twice for the same transaction. The reservation agents are the most condescending I have ever experienced. They are unwilling to do their jobs and try to get you to acquiesce to their attitude rather than follow industry standard customer service. Onboard experience was just as bad. The hardware showed neglected maintenance plus obvious signs of wear and tear with dirty seat cover and tray table. The flight attendants were subpar in their service. I would never fly this airline again.

### "staff on the plane were pleasant"
We had an acceptable night time flight with Air Tahiti Nui from PPT to LAX. The Papeete lounge was air conditioned and spacious. The staff on the plane were pleasant and the food and drink OK, if not high-end cuisine. No complaints from us.

### "last experience with Air Tahiti Nui"
That was our first, and hopefully last, experience with Air Tahiti Nui. Inflight customer service in business class was horrible. The cabin staff looking after us was unprofessional and rude. She didn't offer us any drink unless she needed to. Wasn't friendly. Staff generally were rude and not very welcoming. Food was very poor quality and we were wondering how bad it must be in economy. Overall it wasn't a good experience.

### "inflight entertainment is draconian"
Just arrived off an awful Air Tahiti Nui plane from Los Angeles to Auckland via Tahiti. The main issue was that the inflight entertainment is outdated - it is draconian. If you must fly Air Tahiti Nui, try and avoid the "Borabora" plane - unless you don't wish to watch a movie or play a game. The other planes are better, but they have poor seats that force your head forward. Very awkward. Every flight also boarded late. Not good enough. My worst international flight.

### Air Tahiti Nui customer review
This was an awful business class. Food awful. My seat in business class had metal exposed at the head rest. The entertainment unit was fuzzy. You have to watch the movie when they start, it as it is not on demand. The food was un identifiable as to what it was. They only have four planes, this was the one flagged Bora Bora. It had not been updated.

### Air Tahiti Nui customer review
LAX-PPT-LAX. Having read some of the reviews on here I was a bit worried about what we'd encounter on these flights. Both were overnight so we tried to sleep and made no use of the entertainment system. The aircraft interior was clean and well maintained and the crew were very good. Breakfast was decent. The seat is angled lie flat but reasonably comfortable. Both flights were on time and bags were off quickly. The only downside I could see was the high fares due to I assume lack of competition.

### Air Tahiti Nui customer review
We flew on April 7 and 14 back and forth to Papeete. While the airline staff were friendly and helpful sadly we had an older plane that was not clean and the seats were extremely uncomfortable for our overnight flights. A standard roller bag carry on will not fit in the overhead compartment wheels first and had to be placed sideways. They don't really weigh your carry on at check in but the weight amount of 22 lbs is generous. They didn't weigh or even notice our backpacks. The tray tables were dirty the bathrooms were not kept up during flight and the seats/floor were stained throughout the cabin. I brought Clorox wipes after reading prior reviews to clean off our seating area and felt better after doing so. The amenities were nice such as the overnight flight kit pillows and blankets which were a pleasant feature. The food was not very good at all cold and soggy. The best bet is to bring something such as a Powerbar if you are a picky eater. The movies on the plane were of a good selection but when flying overnight you don't have much time to watch a movie if you are trying to rest. The flight was bumpy both ways but the pilot was considerate in not keeping the seat belt light on for an over-extended period of time. My suggestion is to ask at check in if there are two seats together to transfer to if you are stuck in the row of four you will be much more comfortable. Row 43 (a row of 4) in the back has in seat tray tables so you can't lift the armrest if traveling with a companion and this is not noted anywhere even on Seat Guru. The airport in Papeete is under construction and it took over 2.5 hours for the two planes that arrived at the same time to clear passport control which made us miss the ferry to Moorea. In conclusion if flying to Tahiti again I would try to find a different airline when booking but would likely fly this one again if I had too as the destination is paradise.

### Air Tahiti Nui customer review
My wife and I flew Air Tahiti from LAX to Tahiti and back. We will never make that mistake again. First the interior of the plane was in poor condition. The seats were old uncomfortable and stained. The digital display (which was from the stone age) did not function properly and the resolution was so bad that I elected to just keep it off. Second the seating layout is awful. If you are not in a window section you will be crammed in the middle of the plane in a row of four seats. I flew for 8 hours fighting over the armrest with a total stranger. Lastly my wife reserved a gluten free meal (she has celiac) and she was given raw vegetables a rice cake and yoghurt for breakfast.

### Air Tahiti Nui customer review
Flew Business Class from PPT to LAX only 1 out of 5 planes is older and we had a new cabin. Seats comfortable food excellent service very good. Before Takeoff Captain came through the business class to great every guest personally. If I get the same service every time I would most definitely fly with them again. They are as good as some major Asian Airlines and Miles better than any US Airline I flew recently.

### Air Tahiti Nui customer review
Terrible service. Food was better in economy. Seats were awful - unable to adjust it so you could get comfortable and we are 5ft and 6ft so it should have worked for one of us. Headphone socket broken so unable to watch movies or listen to music. Staff just said 'we can't fix it in flight'. Movies NOT on-demand and you are not informed when they start. Definitely not worth the extra. This was AKL-PPT. Go with Air NZ instead.

### Air Tahiti Nui customer review
Round trip LAX-PPT last 2 weeks of 10/14. Flight out was an old aircraft inflight entertainment was awful. Video worse than your 1957 TV. Service and food ok+. Flight back was newer aircraft and entertainment display was good but content severely limited. Gate agent in PPT refused the check through in domestic USA via the post customs LAX baggage transfer service. She was inflexible and rude about it. They advertise in their magazine they have a deal with Alaska Air my domestic carrier. Alaska in LAX confirmed the deal and that AT was erratic in conforming to the agreement. Moving baggage around LAX isn't fun. Very poor treatment of a business class customer.

### Air Tahiti Nui customer review
Booked C class round trip LAX-PPT. Did not like the previous reviews so I was a little apprehensive. Also as I understand it only 3 of their 5 aircraft have the new C class. As is turned out the new seats were very adequate. At 20.5 they are a tad tight and they do not fully recline. Nonetheless my wife and I were able to sleep most of the way on a long late night flight. Staff were gracious and professional. Food and drink were very adequate but nothing special. All in all a good experience. Tahiti is a very special place and this is as good as it gets.

### Air Tahiti Nui customer review
Flew from CDG to LAX (return) in late August 2014 / early Sept 2014. Awful customer service. The check-in-staff have absolutely no warmth or charm and made no attempt to fulfil my seat request; they were quite abrupt in refusing it moreover. In-air-staff are likewise very poor. Aircraft was old and seats are inadequate. I will never use this airline again. I often travel on Asian airlines and Air Tahiti Nui is way way below par.

### Air Tahiti Nui customer review
LAX to Papeete business class: terrible. Where to start: Old seats straight from the 90's bad shape seats an entertainment system with 4 movies and bad screen quality. Bland food and to top it all magazines which were 3 weeks old. Flight attendants are nonchalant to say the least and you don't see them unless you hunt them down. Forget snacks. Just awful and way below par any other airlines.

### Air Tahiti Nui customer review
AKL-PPT-LAX-PPT in economy May 2014. Air Tahiti Nui only have five A340 aircraft. We flew on three of these - all were different experiences. The first leg AKL-PPT was on "Moorea" which had an upgraded interior and felt very new and fresh. Leg room seemed adequate for economy however as others have said previously the seat designer should be sacked! The head rest is not ergonomic at all and causes discomfort. The is also no lumbar support. I packed the seat back out with pillows to help. The crew were young friendly and worked the cabin non stop. Food on all flights was edible if not slightly odd - the seat designer must have had input in the menu as well. Entertainment on demand comprised of about 10 of movies (some recent releases) and TV shows. The second flight an 8.5 hr overnight flight from PPT-LAX was on "Nuku Hiva". This aircraft was also retrofitted with the new interior however it felt older. tired and there was a noticeable decrease in leg room despite us being in the same seat number on both flights. The crew were a bit surly and disappeared after trolley service. Again the seats weren't that comfortable due to the awful head rest and lack of leg room. Our third flight overnight from LAX to PPT was on "Bora Bora" which has yet to have it's interior retrofitted. The seats were much more comfortable than the newer version in economy as they lacked the offending head rest but the entertainment is on the old loop system rather than 'on demand'. Would I fly them again? Only if the price was right (we scored half price tickets) - you only get what you pay for!

### Air Tahiti Nui customer review
The seats were so uncomfortable I was dreading the flight home. There was no lumbar support and the add on headrest pushed my head forward putting my neck at a very unnatural position. I could not get comfortable using pillows and blankets or in any position. It made for a very long flight home.

### Air Tahiti Nui customer review
Loved this airline except for one problem. They changed our return flight from Auckland so we had to layover for the night. We did not appreciate this change. It cost us a lot more money to stay in a hotel for one night in Tahiti. It made the trip much longer. The flight to Tahiti didn't get in until 9.45 pm and customs took forever. Then we had to be back to the airport by 6 am. If they had to make this change they could have at least left earlier so we wouldn't have had such a long night.

### Air Tahiti Nui customer review
March 29 PPT TAHITI FRENCH POLYNESIA - LAX LOS ANGLES CA. The flight was horrible. After spending a great deal of money for a business class seat I literally had to get up and go and find flight attendants to get a drink of water after not seeing them for a 3 hour stretch. The food was terrible as well. Not worth the money! Horrible service.

### Air Tahiti Nui customer review
Seats are incredibly uncomfortable and service was ok but nothing spectacular. I reacted to something in the air and my eyes started watering and I couldn't stop coughing. I pushed the service button waited 20 minutes and the attendant finally came turned it off and walked away! I cannot stress enough how uncomfortable the seats are especially for tall people. My husband is 6'1" and I'm 5'9". We couldn't move and didn't sleep the entire flight down or back. If there was another way to get to Paradise we would definitely take it!

### Air Tahiti Nui customer review
Flew LAX to PPT and back for an Oceania Cruise. Going to PPT things were just OK. After all you are heading to paradise so it's easier to overlook less than friendly service uncomfortable seats and marginal food. Our return flight was a charter arranged by the cruise line and things were much worse. They had little or no ice limited beverage options and the food was awful. The flight attendants just don't have any spark to them. Some of that may be a cultural thing because I find customer service in FP to be less warm and inviting than in Europe or the US. This airline needs to really punch up their customer service.

### Air Tahiti Nui customer review
I flew round trip to Papeete for a Paul Gauguin cruise. I will never fly that airline again. This is unfortunate for French Polynesia because it is a wonderful place and I loved my time there the the flight was unbearable. The seats are so small with no leg room so that one can hardly move. The country should subsidize the airline or another one so that passengers can visit this beautiful place without the pain associated with getting there.

### Air Tahiti Nui customer review
Flew LAX to Tahiti seats 19K/L with my wife on 23 Jan 14. Both of our entertainment systems did not work. Asked the flight attendant 3 times about it and was ignored. Finally a flight attendant indicated they could sit us in separate seats or two middle seats in the last row.

### Air Tahiti Nui customer review
A 5-hour flight from Auckland to Papeete (Business Class) was more or less ruined by a seat that wouldn't budge from the takeoff/landing bolt upright position and a fold out tray that didn't. The whole aircraft was looking very tired and tatty and badly in need of an upgrade. The Air Tahiti staff at the chaotic boarding gate in Auckland were rude and condescending although the flight attendants did the best they could in such a worn out old bus. Food was OK (I don't expect cordon bleu on a plane) but the wine choice was one cheap red or white. Take it or leave it. Entertainment was very limited too. I was told that of a fleet of 5 aircraft 4 have in fact been upgraded. I guess I found myself on the one that wasn't. Assuming the final aircraft is in fact given the major facelift it so badly needs then I'd consider using Air Tahiti Nui again as a last resort but will take Air New Zealand if it's an available alternative.

AA 7176 (code share) on 1/15/14 Papeete to Los Angeles. Business class on this airline was very disappointing in comparison to other airlines we use. Because our tickets were code share we were not allowed in the business class lounge despite paying for business class fare.

### Air Tahiti Nui customer review
Air Tahiti Nui economy class is awful - very tight cramped seats if you are tall as we are poor service and minimal cardboard food. Our section of the cabin was an oven the section behind us was a refrigerator and the cabin attendants seemed to be unable to do anything about it when you could find one to ask. My husband who is 6 ft’3”was wedged into his seat to the point that the woman in front of him and the woman behind him both complained when he moved and he was unable to sleep at all. We upgraded to first class on the way home and the leg room service and food were very good but they still locked the forward toilets for most of the flight and half the reading lights did not work. We will never fly Air Tahiti Nui again.

### Air Tahiti Nui customer review
Very poor service at LAX from Air Tahiti staff. Flying business class on AA with a code share. They are having some dispute with AA so AA and Air Tahiti are refusing to let each other's business class passengers into their lounges but they don't tell you until you get to the lounge. With three small children and already on flights for 12 hours with a 6 hour stopover in LAX they refused us entry to the Lounge. The staff in the Lounge were kind. Air Tahiti wouldn't let us pay for the lounge without first going out of security again waiting 30 minutes for them to process the payment and receipts and then line up in security all over. Apparently they used to let people phone in the credit card number to avoid having to exit security but now they have decided they rather make passengers spend over an hour at their desk/security. We'll avoid Air Tahiti and AA for a long time.

Excellent service from the flight crew and ground crew. We arrived at LAX with minutes to spare as our inbound flight was delayed 2+ hours. That airline made no effort to put us on another flight. Running all the way from Terminal 1 to Bradley searching for the ATN desk the kind young lady escorted us swiftly to the gate. We just made the flight otherwise would have spent the night in LA. Although our bags didn't make it they were delivered the next day to our hotel. Since we had no luggage when we arrived the airline gave us a nice bag with essential toiletries including T-shirt and shorts which we all sported for the next few hours. The meals were better than expected the in-flight entertainment was better than some major U.S. airlines. The waiting area in Papeete for our homebound flight was fabulous beautiful shops food comfortable lounge chairs gardens.

Flew to Auckland from Papeete. The flight was 5 hours long. I was seated in 6a wonderful smells of the toilet behind us. I found cabin staff rude and unfriendly. They closed business class toilet and told everyone to use the ones in the middle of the plane. They dropped food on my lap while serving bread didn't say sorry but offered me another one. Seats are average for business class and food is terrible. They were "out" of mains when they came to serve us (being in row 6). You do not get additional drinks and if you go and ask for some it's an inconvenience to the staff without a smile or polite conversation. I might sound picky but I am simply wanting something nicer than economy when you pay twice as much for a ticket. The entertainment gave you 8 new movies and a few old titles and tv programs. The seats recline but I am six foot so my feet hang off the edge. If you are travelling by yourself there is no privacy screens like Emirates or Singapore airlines.

### Air Tahiti Nui customer review
We flew from LAX to Papeete and back. We were in a recently remodelled plane but the seats were terrible. They were tightly packed with very little leg room which is the norm. However the back was curved into a concave shape which was agony on a 8.5 hour flight. The headrests exacerbated the problem and my wife's wouldn't even stay up. The cushions were also stiff. There was no power outlet for the seats.

### Air Tahiti Nui customer review
Fight from LAX to PPT. After a full day of US flights from RDU to MSP to LAX we were quite exhausted. A couple of those flights were late and the older planes were packed. So we were hoping for a change of pace on our 8.5 hour flight from LAX to PPT - and we were not disappointed! The A349 was impeccable. We were in coach but the seats were roomy the flight staff was extremely friendly and we had brand new inflight entertainment systems (I think the entire cabin had recently been redone). The experience got our first trip to French Polynesia off to a great start. Yeah it's still tough to sleep in coach seats but the great experience made it bearable. And of course there's nothing like waking up having a good French breakfast and landing in Tahiti with the anticipation of a luxurious vacation ahead! You really have no other options for flying to Tahiti but who cares - Air Tahiti Nui rocked it!

### Air Tahiti Nui customer review
Flew economy round-trip Los Angeles - Papeete. Flights on time on nice aircraft. Economy seating is good and inflight service was excellent. Although aircraft are the same on the return flight got an aircraft that had been reconfigured with their new seats and touch screen videos and was quite nice.

TN 102 PPT-LAX 3/16/2013 Economy Seat 27B. Departed PPT 15 minutes late for no apparent reason. Told we could not check luggage through to DFW. Entertainment screen control did not work properly - also controls overhead reading light. We were skipped for our dinner initially. Attendant seemed bothered that we asked for dinner. Dinner was inedible. Cold slices of meat hard as shoe soles bread that could not be cut. Asked for Diet Coke was told only water was available. Arrived in LAX 15 minutes late. Still had 3 hours to make our connection to DFW. Over an hour before our luggage was available to go through customs. Because we could not check the luggage in PPT had to carry our luggage from the International terminal to AA. Only in LAX does a 3 and 1/4 hour connection become a nail biter we have always had problems at LAX making connections.

### Air Tahiti Nui customer review
My luggage was received two days late in Papeete. Reason: The aircraft was already overloaded when my connection flight from Sydney arrived Auckland. My luggage remained in Auckland that day. On arrival in Papeete there was no assistance at all to passengers without luggage. There was only one person (for about 30 passengers) recording the missing luggage and it took after a late arrival another two hours before we could leave the airport to get some sleep. There was no apology from the airline. The return flight was four hours delayed and the waiting time in Papeete airport was hell. We had to pay for very expensive airport food. WIFI connection did not work and informing relatives about late arrival was impossible. There was little to no information on the reason and what the measures would be and no help from the ground staff. It almost appeared like a cover up. We missed our connecting flights and had later been booked to other flights. Again information was not available from the cabin crew during the flight and only in Auckland we where told to what connecting flight we had been re-booked. A very troublesome check out and check in with going through the immigration twice in Auckland had to be endured.

### Air Tahiti Nui customer review
LAX to PPT on TN101 and returned a week later on TN18. Boarding at LAX less then enjoyable. Sent first to one gate then to another. Don't know if the airline or LAX is to blame there. Once boarding started we were put on buses to go to a satellite boarding point. Main terminal under construction. Inconvenient but it works. Onboard cabin staff were friendly and helpful. First time on an A340. Once in the air the flight went smoothly. The plane was clean. The 2 meals served were adequate in size and somewhat above average as far as airline food goes. Service was good. A red-eye flight in economy class seats is not going to produce quality sleep. The seats were about as comfortable as you would expect which isn't saying an awful lot. Entertainment system was marginal. I never expect much when flying economy but the service and meals were better than expected. Outbound flight departed and arrived on time. Return departed and arrived early. Our bags arrived when we did.

### Air Tahiti Nui customer review
TN 102 from AKL to PPT over last weekend. A very full flight. Punctual in terms of Departure and Arrival. Was given a seat in the last row despite checking in 3hrs in advance. Seat comfort was good. Staff were a mixed bag. Some were exceptionally friendly whilst others gave the impression they would be somewhere else. IFE was non AVOD and lacked choice and content. Food and Drinks were good and plentiful.

### Air Tahiti Nui customer review
LAX-PPT Business Class. Great ambience nice tropical feel as soon as you step on the plane. Normal modern business class seats (not the newest 100% recline ones but plenty of leg room and comfort). Food was very good as well. I recommend flying with them.

### Air Tahiti Nui customer review
Seats are showing some wear and tear. Torn at points and armrest cover hinges feel stuck at times. The entertainment controls on the armrest are worn-out yet still functional. Adjustment of seats: they lack sufficient recline. Controls are placed at hip level inside the chair so poorly accessible. Putting 2 pillows under your feet to raise them makes it better but raising the feet with a pillow will put your toes up against the back of the reclined seat in front of you. I deliberately chose a middle section seat this allows you to always exit without climbing over or being climbed over. The seat rows are that close together that undisturbed passing is impossible. The lumber supports do not work on this flight. Flight entertainment system is Archaic. You don't have the option of starting your movie on demand. The quality of the LCD screen is best described as a snowy CRT up close. The movies continue during PA announcements and since all are continuously playing there is no chance of rewinding. There are no air vents above the seat only general air conditioning. No power output in business class. This is consistent with the age of the seats. Sufficiently equipped courtesy pouch with toothbrush and paste eye covers ear plugs and socks. Headphones supplied are comfortable for the first couple of hours. There was simply no noise cancellation. Service is attentive and correct although the personal touch was missing the second flight. Timely serving and offering of drinks.

### Air Tahiti Nui customer review
LAX-PPT in Business Class. Business Class departure lounge in LAX shared with several other airlines. Nice lounge with free snacks and drinks. Boarding gate was a bit far away we were bussed to the aircraft. First and Business Class customers were boarded in a separate bus. Once onboard - very comfortable. Before take-off drinks offered. Several uniform changes during the 8.5 hour flight. Our flight left LAX on time. As previously noted - business class seats do not fully recline and when you do recline - it protrudes in to the space of the person sitting behind you. Not the best lay out - but certainly adequate. Good meal service and friendly/attentive flight attendants. Return PPT-LAX - same on time departure and arrival and good inflight service.

### Air Tahiti Nui customer review
Scheduled to fly non-stop Paris-Los Angeles. At the check-in counter the sign said 'New York' we were told the flight to LA was simply making a quick stop in New York then would continue to LA. This was a lie. Upon arrival in New York we were told it would be 24 hours until another plane would take us to LA. They put us up in a hotel. 24 hours later it was a charter flight they put us on to LA. I complained to Air Tahiti Nui about the lack of meal and I was told "we went to a very big expense to charter this flight you should be grateful". I should be grateful they arranged me transportation to where I paid to go?

### Air Tahiti Nui customer review
Paris CDG to Los Angeles. Good food crew entertainment and leg space. I enjoyed the whole island theme that was experienced onboard. A plus about the entire experience was the level of visibility and attention the crew provided with frequent water runs and prompt responses to call bell. Another feature was the snack bar set up at the galley for passengers. Flight departed and arrived on time.

### Air Tahiti Nui customer review
LAX-PPT-LAX over Christmas and New Year. Both trips were red-eyes. Outbound from LAX check-in was cheerful and set the tone for the journey. On the down side passengers are bussed to the aircraft and ATN staff lost complete control of the process resulting in a scrum to get on the busses. Onboard we passed on the meal offering and slept. The hot breakfast was welcome. Arrivals Hall was chaos and a 1 hour delay to get through Immigration awaited us. Returning the Departures Area is new spacious but very warm. Boarding went well as our seats were in Row 44 we made our way to the desk 10 minutes before boarding to avoid the chaos we experienced outbound at LAX. Once again pleasant and efficient crew. In summary our flights were good the only warning I would make is that in Economy the seat pitch is only 31 inches and on an 8 hour flight if you are over 6 ft tall this is not comfortable at all.

### Air Tahiti Nui customer review
Flying 3/4 times every year since 2008 my last experience was very disappointing. Besides domestic there is no traffic during the day at Papeete Faaa airport and then late at night they schedule 3 international flights all due to leave within a short hour and this airport can't handle it. I arrived 4 hours before departure and the line for check-in immigration and luggage check were endless. I was booked on TN8 seat 11A to Paris via LAX and after pulling out we came back to the parking stand because of an engine problem. We were told it would take an extra 3 hours to change it. They decided to serve us the light cold snack. The previous times I flew we used to have a full hot meal with wine it is obvious ATN is cutting costs and service. Finally airborne 4 hours behind schedule we were expecting to be served a round of drinks but nothing on this 8 hours flight until an hour before touching down in LAX they served us breakfast. The 11 hour flight to Paris went without problem but no round of water or drinks served between lunch and breakfast. Unfortunately due to the monopoly ATN has on these routes I will have no choice but to fly with them again.

### Air Tahiti Nui customer review
LAX-CDG and CDG-LAX several times in past 3 years. I appreciate the little flower they give when entering the plane. On the latest trip staff walk through the cabin several times through the flight but the call light was ignored or they were too busy with helping someone else. I never did like plane food so this one was no different. Person sitting in front of me had their seats reclined right back so it was hard to place my food on the tray. The steward serving food saw and told him to put his seat up.

### Air Tahiti Nui customer review
Los Angeles to Paris return. We boarded our flight with high expectations however we were sorely disappointed. While others could check 2 pieces of luggage free we were allowed only one. We had been told to expect seats that were roomier with more leg room than other airlines but we were as crowded as on any low-cost airline. Onboard the service was poor and the food quality was poor. Attendants came down the aisle infrequently to offer snacks. The flight itself was fine and on-time but we agreed we would not fly this airline again.

### Air Tahiti Nui customer review
Onboard the air conditioning was broken and the pilot would not turn the engine on as there was another malfunction with the luggage loading. We left over 1.5 hrs late and missed our connecting flight back to Boston. Another rude service counter agent would not help us they would not provide us hotel voucher as it was not there fault or problem. I noticed a terrible attitude problem when enquiring.

### Air Tahiti Nui customer review
LAX-Tahiti. We were informed by our travel agent about the strike and had to switch out flight from LAX-Tahiti. When we got to LAX we had to wait 3 hrs in line before we could get our boarding passes. We received very little information regarding the delay. The service agents stood there and looked at you but had no answers. This was a horrible experience. The best part of the night was when the Air New Zealand crew showed up. They chartered Air New Zealand to take us to Tahiti. That crew and flight was wonderful. On the way home from Tahiti the strike was over so we had Air Tahiti Nui for the flight home. The service on the fight was horrible. If you put on your call light they would ignore you.

### Air Tahiti Nui customer review
Paris-LAX The plane was immaculate staff friendly and food was fabulous! We were given a menu two hot meals and snacks during the flight. If we needed something else we were able to go to the galley and ask for ice cream or drinks at no charge. It was a long flight from Paris to LA but it was very comfortable and didn't feel like 12 hours because of the service.

### Air Tahiti Nui customer review
CDG to LAX. The cabin was very cramped and hot throughout the flight but service and food was quite good and a real surprise after our experience on the ground. We arrived two hours ahead of time at CDG. After it took over an hour (about 75 minutes) to check in we then got in line next to go through security. After waiting about 30 minutes and becoming very concerned about them shutting the doors before we got through I asked the now idle check-in people if there was a way to get us through so we would not miss the flight. The manager very dismissively told us to get to the back of the line there was nothing he could do. After another 20 minutes with a security agent telling us to just have an airline rep walk us to 1st class line and being told again by the to just go back to the end of the line a security agent walked us to another area and through 1st class line. We were very surprised when we got onboard to see the same inept and rude people who did check-in were the first class and business class stewards. All they had to say to us when I said I was worried about missing the flight was "We know you are here checked-in and in line for security. We won't leave without you. Instead rudeness and attitude was all I got.

### Air Tahiti Nui customer review
Basically I can confirm the other reviewers of this inept airline management. We were scheduled to fly on a Friday morning in June 2010 and were called by Air Tahiti Nui the night before saying there was a strike in Paris and to check the web site for updates on the flight. So we did the strike was a Civil strike in French Polynesia not Paris. Anyway we checked all night with no updates so travelled on the shuttle bus to the airport as scheduled. We stood in line for an hour to checkin before they opened the desks. Queued for another 30 mins to get to the front of the line at which point we were told to go and speak to "that guy over there". He told us the Paris flight was cancelled shrugging his shoulders and casting his eyes anywhere but us. He gave us a piece of paper and said to call the number. He was very dismissive and unhelpful. We did and were told initially they would book us on another airline. 10 minutes later they said they were no longer booking anyone on another airline. At which point they said we can either get a refund and get our own flights at another airline ticket desk (at now exorbitant rates) or we could wait and see if a Tahiti Nui flight would leave the next day. Maybe. They claimed all Air France flights were full. There were no offers of help. They refused to put us up in a hotel because we were "local" (we live 60 miles from LAX). We basically had to take the refund and get our own flights. We did get a direct flight with Air France at 9pm. It was a 777 and was basically empty. So now we have to fight our travel insurance company to get the difference in costs back. Might advice is don't travel on Air Tahiti Nui.

### Air Tahiti Nui customer review
On the way to the airport in Tahiti (flight to LA) we were told the flight was cancelled becasue the pilots just went on strike no one seemed to know anything. My mother who is 89 was ill and needed to get back to the US so I called Air Tahiti and they said they could get us on Air France the next morning and to be at the airport at 4:30 am which we did. We did not have seats on Air France as promised and we were told to wait for the Air Tahiti rep who did not show up until 6:30 am. I told her that Air Tahiti had promised us seats on air france due to a medical emergency and she said "I didn't work yesterday and I cannot help you" and slammed the door in my face. I knocked on the door and she came out and I got exactly the same response. She was so incredibly rude considering we had been sitting on the ground in the airport for 2 hrs. Luckily we got on stand by to LA which was not our final destination. We lost all of our connecting flights. which delayed medical treatment. I would not recommend them to anyone.

### Air Tahiti Nui customer review
Once on the plane it was great but ground team was horrible and inept. We boarded at LAX for CDG and were amazed at the lack of urgency or customer concern. As the plane sat empty and the gate agent sat talking on her cell phone we all looked on amazed. 45 minutes after we were scheduled to board she announced we would be boarding 15 minutes late due to the plane arriving late - although it had been parked at the gate for hours as we waited. Clearly she had not looked at a clock. This caused us to depart over an hour late. Unfortunately we were on this trip during the Iceland Volcano Eruption. Air Tahiti once again proved how little they cared. I called the airlines 3 times about a flight only to be hung up on by the attendent. Once we had a flight we were told to be at the Airport 4 hours ahead of time due to the challenge from the Volcano. We arrived 4 hours early but the agents did not. We all (350 of us) waited in line. When they did show up it took them 45 minutes to get ready have coffee chat laugh joke and enjoy themselves all in front of us without any communication with us. Zero urgency or concern for all of us who had been waiting days to get on a plane. Once ticketed we went to the gate plane was there flight crew was there but not gate agents for hours we waited until they showed up and even longer while they organized themselves. It was like a circus show watching them. The whole ordeal was so ridiculous and unnecessary. The ground team has no care or concern or urgency for the passenger. I will never fly this airline again. They didn't earn any stars with us.

PPT-AKL. Crew gracious and friendly. Huge evidence of cost cutting in food but wine and drinks selection still good. They need new seats - if person in front reclines fully there is no chance of any movement. Crew attention to safety is impressive.

### Air Tahiti Nui customer review
LAX-CDG First Class Seat 1D. A340. Small private cabin with only 6 seats. The crew professional and courteous. Food and wine decent. Lie flat seat very dated and more comparable to Business Class. Poor selection of movies most at least 10 years old.

### Air Tahiti Nui customer review
AKL-PPT return in economy in A340-300. About a few months after booking ATN sent me an e-mail with cancellation of the return flight due to a commercial decision. Because this is not a daily route I had to change both my outbound and inbound flight and either a domestic flight in New Zealand. No online check-in and advanced seat allocation possibility. Check-in both in Auckland and Papeete slow: few counters and long rows. Cabin crew friendly and well dressed with Tiare flowers in their hair. Decent food each seat has a PTV but no AVOD. Pretty cramped leg room. Once on the French Polynesian islands I was not able to change my return flight to Auckland with my standard Y fare which I don't understand. Overall the booking system and ground service are a bit outdated (still need to reconfirm flights) but in the aircraft you will have a small Tiare flower behind your ear and a smile on your face because this is an airline that flies to a very exotic location.

### Air Tahiti Nui customer review
LAX-PPT. The captain and crew thought people could govern themselves as there was no proper checking to see if everyone was belted in when the fasten seatbelt sign came on. Drinks were complimentary and meals decent. I was lucky enough to have a row of four seats to myself which I used to make a makeshift bed. My flight was a good one although the fare was steep - airline has actually been scrutinized recently for corrupt operating practices including sky- high fares so don't be surprised if your airfare is more than you expect.

### Air Tahiti Nui customer review
AKL-PPT-LAX. Horrible flight horrible service. Very slow check in and cramped seats. Service and food on flight fine. However arrived in LAX and they had lost my luggage. Waited 3 hours at the baggage carousel because attendents were disorganized kept walking away and not returning and they had no counter (or system it seems) to handle lost baggage. I was told unclaimed bags were just thrown on the carousel for the next flight coming in and that I should wait around to see if my bags arrived on another flight. Took 5 days to receive my bags. Air Tahiti Nui baggage line never answered my calls went to an answering machine and I left several messages. I only received a call 3 days later saying they had found my bags and they would arrive at my door the next day - which they did not. Wasted 2 days waiting at home for bags that didn't arrive. Finally received my luggage and called to claim my $65 compensation. I couldn't get this either and was told conflicting advice about having to fax someone or having to wait until I got back to Auckland. I was also told that my 2 hour layover was not enough time for the airport in Tahiti to transfer bags to a new plane. Since I had the same layover on the way back I called reservations to see what could be done so I didn't have the same problem on the way back to Auckland - flight change pay for an upgrade mark my bags as priority (I would have been happy with any advice they could give). During this conversation I was talked at instead of listened to treated rudely and the end result was that I was told there was nothing they could do and I shouldn't be so negative. I was told I shouldn't call them anymore. Apparently one phone call is considered harassment. All in all very bad flight and awful service. Even if this flight is a bit cheaper I will gladly pay more and fly Qantas or Air NZ in future. Would not recommend this airline at all.

### Air Tahiti Nui customer review
PPT-AKL. Attentive flight attendants courteous with genuine care. Hot brunch was not the best I've had on Air Tahiti Nui with meal overcooked/overheated. IFE equipment could be updated and it is now redundant compared to other airlines but choice offered makes up for it. The three languages (French/English/Tahitian) used for inflight communication are well enunciated but could be restricted to French and English only as too many announcements are quite distracting.

AKL-PPT. A very enjoyable flight - check in quick and pleasant crew friendly and professional. Food good and nice wine choices. Old style seats really let them down but otherwise nothing to fault

### Air Tahiti Nui customer review
I have flown Air Tahiti Nui several times. I always fly First Class. The level of service on the 2 flights I took on this trip has diminished. The amenity kits are not the same. On the flight LAX to PPT I was given an appetizer that was a joke. A small piece of shrimp with some sauce and 2 pieces of cheese. This is not First Class Service I was used to with Air Tahiti Nui previously. The boarding process is nerve racking. I resent having to go boxed in the buses that transport you to the aircraft. They box you in like sardines. I pay nearly $5000.00 for a one way flight to PPT and get the same boarding treatment was a coach paying passenger.

### Air Tahiti Nui customer review
AKL-PPT-AKL. Did MEL-AKL earlier in the day with Emirates on a seperate booking. Bags checked in through to PPT at MEL did make it with us so no complaints there. Looking at the plane's fuselage the cabin decor and the Tahitian music playing made you feel you are going on a vacation. Inflight crew attentive and friendly especially on the way back. Meals were good. Only sore point was the IFE. It was not AVOD and very limited choices. Had the IFE been better would have scored this flight at 9 or 10.

### Air Tahiti Nui customer review
The overnight flight Papeete to LA was cancelled without notice. We were booked on the flight 12 hours later which meant we could not make any connecting flights that day to JFK as we arrived too late. We were given an hotel room for the night before the flight but had to fend for ourselves in LA for the enforced overnight stop. The reason for the cancellation was not made clear but I would suspect it was none other than not enough passengers as cancellations seems to happen frequently. The same flight the previous evening had also been cancelled. At no time did anyone offer an apology. I would not recommend this airline as they are unreliable.

### Air Tahiti Nui customer review
LAX-PPT-AKL-LAX Economy return. The flight from LAX to PPT was cancelled. I was notified about two weeks before the flight was supposed to leave. I was a bit peeved as the flight from LAX was a connecting flight and the cancellation meant that I had to overnight in LA and take the next flight the following morning. I explained my situation to Air Tahiti Nui and they put me up in a hotel (Four Points by Sheraton)and gave me dinner and breakfast vouchers! The flights were all on time plane modern plenty of room for economy. I'm 5'11 and was comfortable for the entire trip. The inflight entertainment is not as modern as it could be its not on demand but the movie selection is good and there is a nice selection of recent releases. One note of caution try to avoid any stopovers in Tahiti that will be longer than two hours - the airport is old and boring and there is nothing to do while you wait not even a TV to watch. The food was superb for economy and inflight service by the attendants was friendly polite and professional. Topping all of this off is the fact they were $700-$1000USD cheaper than ANZ Qantas or United.

### Air Tahiti Nui customer review
AKL-LAX-AKL (via PPT) First Class. The service onboard is outstanding and pretty difficult to fault. The crew could not have been more professional or pleasant. Food AKL-PPT and PPT-LAX would have been at home in 5 star restaurant (less good on the return but still acceptable). Seats although first generation lie flat were comfortable and all features worked. There is no screen between passengers but I did not feel an invasion of personal space. Boarding on all legs was efficient and every leg left early . The negatives? Ground crew at all three airports. At the initial check in Auckland I did not get the aisle seat I had requested and had been confirmed with the airline 7 months earlier - and had to kick up quite a fuss - miraculously one opened up. The same thing happened PPT-LAX. On arrival at LAX no bags. They were off-loaded at PPT and could not be traced. They did turn up on the next flight: that isn't good enough on economy but it is completely unacceptable in First. The response of the LAX agents could not havee dismissive. Arriving back in Auckland bags (which had first and priority labels) were the last to appear (perhaps I should be grateful that they appeared at all!). So inflight this is a rival to any airline and competitively priced on the Transpacific route; it certainly would have been a "10". If only they could get their act together with ground crew.

### Air Tahiti Nui customer review
The flight attendants told passengers those in-transit to Auckland need not complete the Tahitian immigration forms and we should proceed to the transit lounge. This is what we had expected and made sense. Once off the aircraft though those of us who entered the lane marked transit lounge and walked the short distance to the transit lounge found it locked. No one could tell us why it was locked how to enter the lounge or what to do. We asked the cabin crew as they came off the aircraft and they shrugged their shoulders and walked on. Eventually we realized the only option was to complete Tahitian immigration forms and go into the baggage claim area as it appeared we might be able to enter the transit lounge from there. This however proved not to be true. Again no one seemed to know what we should do even though we kept asking how to enter the transit lounge. I speak passable French so this was not a language problem. Eventually we picked up our luggage and cleared Customs. When we entered the airport terminal I found an Air Tahiti Nui staff and she told us that the transit lounge was not open and we would have to go to a hotel for the night. She seemed unconcerned and disinterested. I then found the security office but they couldn't tell me anything. I returned to the Air Tahiti Nui staff who told me that everyone knows that Tahiti won't let passengers use the transit lounge and we should have known it. We weren't about to spend over $100 to stay in a hotel room for a few hours so along with two dozen other passengers we spent the time in the hot dirty smoky airport terminal. The ATN check-in desks finally opened at about 4-30 a.m. and we were able to get our boarding passes but as Security didn't open for another hour or so we were still forced to wait in the terminal. Once allowed into the departure lounge we found that it was shabby dirty and unpleasant. A small coffee bar sold food but didn't accept credit cards and we weren't about to go back out through Security to find an ATM to get cash in a currency we didn?t need just to buy a cup of coffee. You may wonder why we didn't just go directly to the departure lounge and wait there. Well the ATN staff in LAX refused to give us the boarding passes from Papeete to Auckland. They said that they issue boarding passes no more than three hours in advance. When we arrived in Papeete the check-in counters were closed. Thus we couldn't get boarding passes and couldn't get into the departure area. Three weeks later when departing Auckland I asked an ATN supervisor why they don't let transit passengers use the transit lounge. She said that in their view a layover of that length does not constitute in-transit and that they are unwilling to allow people to use the transit lounge. As ridiculous as this is the worst part is that they don't bother to warn you about it before you travel so you can take this into account when making your travel plans. Upon arrival back in Papeete with only an hour layover we again found the transit lounge locked even though flight attendants assured us we would be allowed to wait in the transit lounge. Instead they simply diverted transit passengers directly into the departure lounge even though most hadn't been issued a boarding pass in Auckland (we had one but only because I went back to the check-in counter and insisted upon it). Obviously they could have done exactly the same thing on the Papeete- Auckland overnight layover had they wanted to do so. I suspect the whole thing is a means of trying to force passengers to spend some money in Tahiti. Whatever the reason it is a shabby way to treat passengers.
