### "worst airline experience ever."
Not Verified |  The worst airline experience ever. Delayed 3 times over 3 flights, more than 2h, does not announce it, no compensation. Ultra cheap, ultra bad. Colombia deserves better for its people and tourists

### "Nothing to complain about"
Check in at San Andres had to be done at the airport since I had a bag to drop off, the line was very long so I waited about 40 minutes. Since there are no drinks or snacks available for sale on the plane I bought some stuff at the airport to bring along on the plane. Flight back to Bogota was quite smooth, quiet and easy. I flew back on the same plane that had brought me to San Andres. Nothing to complain about. Cheap option to San Andres and very efficient.

### "Cheap prices, comfortable seats"
Cheap prices, comfortable seats, decent legroom (30 inches) on the former IndiGo airplane. Check in at Bogota was done online but tourist pass for San Andres and bags had to be dropped off at the check in counter, which was pretty easy. Boarding was a breeze. After take off many people switched seats since most didn’t pay for an assigned one. Flight was 30 minutes late but otherwise good. The only problem we’re kids running up and down the aisle like wild animals and nobody from the crew stopping them. Unfortunately due to Colombias COVID rules there was no inflight service but you are able to bring your own drinks and snacks.
