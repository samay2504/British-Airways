### "flawless as ever"
On October 10th we flew from Vienna to Karpathos which turned out to be the last passenger flight with this Airline to this destination, due to the sad development. The crew worked flawless as ever and was extremely friendly despite the fact that they are not quite sure about their professional future. Not a single mention came up about that but you could see and sense their feelings. We are exceedingly angry about the fact that many thousand passengers loose their money and some thousand well working employess lose their job. Many many thanks and good luck for the crew and all the other employees of AB/Niki.

### "should be ashamed of your policy"
Flew Innsbruck to Palma. €101 to carry a suitcase is shameful. I thought Ryanair were deceptive in their hidden costs but this is completely unjustifiable. You are required to book cases 30 hours prior to flying, we tried 24 hours before as we hadn't fully packed and didn't know our requirements. NIKI you should be ashamed of your policy.

### "crew were very friendly"
Berlin Tegel to Vienna. On my short weekend trip to Vienna I ended up in a Niki aircraft, although booked with Air Berlin. You can see a small difference between Niki and its bigger sister, for example the crew wear an pink/violet uniform and probably the main difference being that Niki still gives the complementary drinks (one hot and one cold) and a little snack (a vegetarian and a non-vegetarian option) and it was like in the old days at Air Berlin. The flight was of course, on time. The crew were very friendly the seat was very spacious (I got one with extra-legroom as a topbonus platinum) A nice airline for a nice flight.

### "a nice short journey "
Took a short flight from Paris to Vienna and the flight was delayed due to unknown reasons. The aircraft was clean, crew members were welcoming. I didn't expect free meals from low cost airline but was served sandwich and drinks. I hesitated while booking a flight with Niki but it was a nice short journey apart from little delay, will consider in future.

### "I got customer not found"
Vienna to Abu Dhabi return. We booked our flight with FlyNiki from Vienna to Abu Dhabi and return. The inbound flight was okay, web check in worked like a charm once I called Etihad to see why I can't check in with them, and they pointed me to FlyNiki. One suitcase got devastated (no wheels left in Abu Dhabi) but they are not to blame. The problem came with the return flight. I tried checking in as usual on their website, tried the confirmation number first and got error: customer not found. Then I decided to try the tickets and lucky me, I got checked in. This however was not the case for my family. Every time I tried checking them in I got customer not found. I have tried contacting them the very same night with no success (their Abu Dhabi toll free number doesn't work). Finally gave up and contacted them via the online form (after almost 30 minutes of struggling with the thing). Next day I woke up and tried all the numbers I could find - Abu Dhabi airport, Etihad, Toll free number (all of these cost money to call) with no success. Not knowing if my family even had a chance of flying I contacted the hotel's concierge, who was lucky enough to get me through to AirBerlin. Now comes the funny part: the guy on the line confirmed all tickets are valid but I wasn't checked in, nor had any other passenger on the flight. The flight was empty. So I asked him if we go to the airport and check in there, would it be possible to get seated one next to each other (at least my wife and the kid). He said it's not a problem. Going to the airport the flight turned out to be full and it was only because of the kindness of the Etihad staff that we got adjacent seats. The thing that angered me the most was they did answer the contact form on their site 2 hours before the flight saying: We also want to inform you that for this reservation wasn't made any check-in for any of the tickets. The airport has already took control over the tickets so a check-in directly at the airport will be necessary. They don't even know what's happening with their own reservations.

### "Niki's service is not that good"
Niki is no low cost airline anymore (if it ever was one). Flights between large European cities cost up to 100€ and more, also my flight from VIE to FCO was not cheap but Niki's service is not that good. The only thing Niki offers you compared to other airlines is a cold and ugly sandwich plus a soft drink but it is not worth the price. However the ground staff (which in fact were staff from the airport) were experienced and friendly. Despite that the cabin crew was unkind and sloppy and their english-skills had been disastrous. The IFE was made up of a safety video and a map not more.

### "cabin was clean"
Flew NIKI from Valencia to Vienna. Quick boarding and on-time departure. Cabin was clean and the flight was smooth and relaxed. Cabin crew provided drinks and a very good cheese sandwich. Later they provided us another round of water and coffee. Seats a little bit narrower than other airlines. Paid 120 € for a return ticket for flying with a very good airline.

### "seats uncomfortable and narrow"
I flew from Alicante to Vienna return with NIKI. On the outbound flight, we had a big delay. When we boarded, the plane had not been cleaned with previous passengers trash. The seats were uncomfortable and narrow. There was no space for your legs and as they put in so many rows of seats, the hand luggage does not fit. There are some screens. However, you have to pay for headphones and there were no subtitles. The screen was just above my head and the next screen was too far away, so they were pretty useless. On the positive side, they give you a sandwich and a small glass to drink. On the inbound flight at the check-in counter they printed the boarding pass of another passenger. Fortunately I noticed it in time, but the staff attended to me with very bad manners as though it was my fault. We had another delay because the staff were weighing all the hand luggage.

### "nice onboard service"
I flew with NIKI this week from Vienna to Alicante and back and it was a great experience. It's not expensive, return ticket was €140 with check-in luggage which is not bad. You also get nice onboard service. Sure a sandwich isn't a full meal but it's enough and we had 3 rounds of drinks with a selection of coke, fanta, sprite, water and quality juices. I also like screens which showed the 'Big bang theory' and our flight info. I will fly with them again, it's great value for money and you keep both your money and your dignity.

### "surely fly them again"
Spotless short flight with NIKI operated with a very clean and good looking plane, polite crew and ontime departure/arrival which is more than enough for me to be satisfied about this short hop to Vienna where I had to attend a congress. A big plus is they fly from Linate airport which is much closer to my house than Malpensa and this is why I did not fly Austrian as I usually do for this route. Their website worked well so checking-in online was very easy both ways. I will surely fly them again inside Europe.

### "staff were great"
Saltzburg to Manchester. Flight was great, staff were great, all on time, communications great, better than other budget airlines. All let down by Swissport who couldn't unload the plane or communicate in anyway, getting the bags almost took longer than the flight. 1hr 30mins to get the bags.

### "impressed with everything"
Düsseldorf to Vienna, and the flight was on time, seats were comfortable and sandwiches were served for this short 50 minute flight. I was very impressed with everything, since I had never heard of the company before taking this flight! The flight attendants wore jeans, which surprised me at first, but was not much of a bother for the cheap price I payed my ticket.

### NIKI customer review
I flew from Olbia (Sardinia) to Vienna. It was a little delayed from departure but we enjoyed their service. The cabin crew was attentive and friendly. They had sandwiches both vegetarian (containing egg) and non-vegetarian.

### NIKI customer review
VIE-KEF on an A320. Slightly late getting away from VIE landed 20 mins late. Online check in good. Boarding well managed. Seat horrific. Exceptionally uncomfortable for a 4 hour 15 minute flight. Parked at a remote gate and took 45 minutes to arrange a bus to collect us they even managed to bring the next set of passengers returning to VIE to the aircraft before off-loading us. A total mess. Despite the huge delay we waited for 15 minutes for the luggage. Appreciate that it was the fault of KEF ground handling but it's the airline's choice which company they use. Lack of comfort and ground handling failure will probably mean that I avoid Niki next time.

### NIKI customer review
Economy flight from VIE to HAM on a NIKI A321 (booked with Air Berlin). Flight was 30 minutes late due to aircraft change so we saw crew hastily changing. Crew was nice and there was a good sandwich a free soft drink or coffee for that 1 hour flight. The seat distance was the worst I have seen! Being 189cm I could only find one position to sit and still felt cramped. So if you are over 180 cm (6ft) height avoid.

### NIKI customer review
Barcelona - Vienna Feb 2014. Clean plane captain and crew fully alert and friendly / helpful and in a good mood free papers free soft drinks and sandwich. Plane on time on departure and arrival. Only negative point: Swissport counter crew at Barcelona that does ground service for many airlines. Partly incompetent uninterested laid back and no sense of urgency. Left baggage for almost 20 minutes standing on weighing scale - later admitted they had "forgotten" it. Then affixed a priority sticker. Other problems encountered not responsibility of Air Niki but of Barcelona airport layout and management / airport staff.

### NIKI customer review
7th July 2013 (GRZ-SSH) and 21th July 2013 (SSH-HRG-GRZ) with Airbus A320 OE-LEX. Everything was fantastic! Cabin was clean and food it very tasty. The chief flight attendant was the same on all two flights and she was really very friendly and other members of the crew were very kind. I flew to Egypt with many different airlines but NIKI was the best they had the best food most friendly crew and they have new aircraft's.

### NIKI customer review
CPH-VIE-CPH 16th May outbound. 2 year old ERJ190 clean and comfortable seats. 3/4 full. Free drinks and sandwich. Chicken or cheese to choose. The little sandwich was okay for this 1h 35mins flight. 19th may inbound. Clean newer A320. Comfortable seats. Same service as the outbound flight. OK sandwich. All in all I had a very good trip with them.

### NIKI customer review
DUS-VIE. Very friendly and motivated staff. Best standard service of the German speaking airlines.

### NIKI customer review
VIE - HAM. No leg room at all crew and food was alright but wouldn't recommend this airline.

### NIKI customer review
HAM to VIE and return. Booked as an Air Berlin flight it was operated both ways without any information by Niki. Absolutely no leg-space in economy class. Horrible. You couldn't even read the airline-magazine. Can't recommend this airline!

### NIKI customer review
VIE-FRA-VIE. Everything went smoothly only remark is that the chief flight attendant's English was not understandable.

### NIKI customer review
VIE-TLV. Flight to Tel Aviv only half full return 3/4 full so lot of space to stretch out. Airbus A320 both ways cabin and lavatories very clean. Both flights on time FA's very friendly and kind. They served a snack on both ways which wasn't very tasty but offered water and soft drinks multiple times. Not much information from the cockpit. What bothered me most was the bad flight time to and from TLV. I would definitely use NIKI again as they are a very nice airline but only if flight time is ok.

### NIKI customer review
CPH-Vienna return over the Christmas holiday. The plane and cabin was simple but comfortable. Flight attendants were cheerful and polite and information from the cockpit was good. They gave us a complimentary sandwich and drink which many of the major European Airlines do not do anymore. We were able to check one bag for free. All of this for 110 Euros per person.

### NIKI customer review
I flew back from Wien to Paris. On the way from Paris I was quite satisfied with the service. Unfortunately on the return we ended up with 4.5 hrs delay and the way Niki treated us was awful. They first announced 30 mins delay but every 30 mins they added another 30 mins. Staff were unable to answer any questions. We were parked into a small waiting room before they finally let us out because delay was too long. They finally asked us to pay for food and drinks and that we would be paid back - which to now has not happened yet. Finally we arrived in Paris 0hr 30 - no more trains we had to take a taxi. Overall it costs me and my girlfriend an additional 100€ to arrive tired in Paris.

### NIKI customer review
VIE-ZHR-VIE and VIE-CPH-VIE. Onboard experience is great seats are comfortable and crew are extremely friendly. As catering they serve home-made bread with ham or cottage cheese. Simple but extremely tasty. Soft drinks are free of charge but I noticed they charge for alcohol. Some airport benefits for elite members of top bonus could be handled better.

### NIKI customer review
VIE-CDG return. In and outbound flight were on time and the planes clean. The onboard entertainment system worked and showed two TV episodes. Service was nice a snack and two rounds of drinks.

### NIKI customer review
VIE-ZRH-VIE. No problems with check-in baggage and no delays. On-board service was okay - there was even a hot snack on the return evening flight. They call themselves 'low-cost' but the service is in my opinion better than many 'traditional flyers'.

### NIKI customer review
VIE-CPH on Embraer for 45 EUR (baggage was free of charge). People tend to call this airline low-cost but even though it indeed has great prices it offers great quality of service using modern aircrafts and comfortable seats. Attentive and friendly cabin crew provided great food (it was morning flight we received bread with ham or cheese - which was handmade and much better than hot breakfasts at other airlines; plus you can pay for extended breakfast) and two drink services (on 90 mins long flight!) soft drinks are free of charge. As always we were offered newspapers and magazines and what surprised me was that we received a pillow (which is everything but standard on European flights even in business class).

### NIKI customer review
VIE-DUS-VIE. Efficient check-in very attentive cabin crew modern aircraft complimentary sandwiches soft drinks and free checked baggage. Very nice experience if you wish to have smooth and comfortable flight book with Niki - much better than some non-lowcost airlines. All for very low price - even without promotion.

### NIKI customer review
Outstanding value for money. One way flight FCO-VIE. Served beverages and snacks equivalent to a full meal. Very courteous crews. On time departure and arrival. It was a family trip with my wife and my daughter they felt the same way. Newspaper and magazines offered. It was late flight so I did not find one in English.

### NIKI customer review
Nice to Vienna. Return flight cost less than 100 euros including luggage. Was expecting budget airline but pleasantly surprised when drinks and newspapers were offered free of charge. Was even more surprised when a snack was included. Service was courteous and efficient. Embraer E175 was new and airy compared to similar aircraft. Regular updates from the cockpit. All in all a class act and not sure how they make any profit.

### NIKI customer review
VIE OTP with E190. Very good service onboard. Crew very nice and seemed to be very satisfied with their work - a good atmosphere on board. Coffee drinks and very good sandwiches served free.

### NIKI customer review
VIE-FRA on A320. The service on board Niki (staff free magazines newspapers catering) was excellent and better than the service offered by legacy carriers I am used to in Europe.

### NIKI customer review
Rome FCO-Vienna return flight. Outstanding quality a low-cost flight with top level service. Clean and well-kept aircraft crew nice as are free beverages and snacks served during the flight. Newspapers and magazines also for free. I used the online check-in options and got to choose my seats with no charge. Terrific value for money.

### NIKI customer review
FRA - VIE return A320. Niki offers exceptional value for money. The fare was comparable to most low-cost airlines but unlike these Niki fares include all services that are considered to be "frills" nowadays. For example newspapers magazines sandwiches and several rounds of drinks are offered free of charge. Free baggage allowance of 20kgs. The cabins were clean and smiling FAs took care of their passengers.

### NIKI customer review
MXP-VIE with new E190 - even full the plane feels spacious. Good Flyniki service (coffee/drinks & sandwich for free). Plane on time cabin crew was friendly.

### NIKI customer review
VIE-MUC-VIE on new Embraer E190 seated in row 2 and row 1. Boarding smooth although a docking pier would be preferable in VIE. Cabin seats clean and looked new. The legroom was above average and comfortable for the 40 mins flight. Snacks (two very good "Demel" sandwiches) and drinks (soft-drinks coffee water) were served. On the way back to VIE MUC airport was closed due to thunderstorms and the flight was delayed over 1.5hrs. In the meantime cabin crew offered hot Frankfurter sausages. You get free (mainly Austrian) newspapers and magazines after boarding. Flight attendants were friendly and helpful although they have a lot to do during this just 40-minutes short flight.

### NIKI customer review
BEG-VIE-BEG on new E190. Very good service on a 55 min route. Free luggage up to 20 kg new planes friendly but rather busy crew choice of sandwiches and 2 rounds of soft drinks free of charge! Legroom was ok  leather seats.Most fully fledged carriers on short haul would be left ashamed by level of service offered by Niki.

### NIKI customer review
VIE-INN-VIE on A320/319. Both flights on tim with baggage allowance friendly staff good sandwiches (two per flight) non alcoholic drink selection free of charge comfortable seats and great legroom. Everything I want from airline for as low as 83 EUR.

### NIKI customer review
SZG-HER-SZG. Crew polite and friendly. One little downrating because the audio system did not work. NIKI is one of the rare airlines who serve one free snack and drink on charter flights and provide newspapers free as well. Additional drinks or food has to be paid for.

### NIKI customer review
VIE-FRA quick online check in. Tidy cabin very friendly FAs who were busy but still had time for a short chat with the passengers. Free news papers and magazines. Free soft drinks and coffee plus a fresh sandwich. Even some gifts for children were handed by FAs. This combined with a fair price is all what a regular passenger needs. Small minuses - hard seats medium leg room and transfer by bus instead of airlink. Still much better than any other budget airline.
